The patch introduces a locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function in the `drm/nouveau/abi16` module. This locked variant is necessary for providing limited interoperability in USIF, as it requires access to ABI16 data.

The patch modifies the existing `nouveau_abi16_get()` function by making it static and introducing a new function called `nouveau_abi16()` that performs the actual logic of obtaining the ABI16 data. The modified `nouveau_abi16_get()` function now acquires the client mutex, calls `nouveau_abi16()` to check if the ABI16 data is available, and returns the ABI16 data if it exists. If the ABI16 data is not available, the function releases the mutex and returns NULL.

The patch also includes the necessary header file inclusion and function definition changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-implemented and addresses the need for a locked variant of `nouveau_abi16_get()`. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the f2fs file system code in two places: fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c and fs/f2fs/super.c.

In fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c, the patch adds a check for sbi->s_dirty under the cp_mutex. This is necessary because s_dirty is reset under that mutex. The previous condition was incorrect, as it did not consider the case where a checkpoint was done followed by all the node pages being written back. The patch correctly handles this scenario by checking sbi->s_dirty and skipping the checkpoint if it is not dirty.

In fs/f2fs/super.c, the patch removes a condition that checked sbi->s_dirty and the result of get_pages(sbi, F2FS_DIRTY_NODES) before returning 0. This condition is no longer necessary because the check for sbi->s_dirty has been moved to fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c. Removing this condition simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary checks.

The patch addresses a bug in the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm implementation in the TCP protocol. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes if the next ACK advances SND_UNA (send unacknowledged) and does not sack a new packet. This behavior leads to the sender always sending new data instead of repairing holes, resulting in longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

The patch modifies the code in the tcp_process_loss function in the net/ipv4/tcp_input.c file. It adds a condition to check if SND_NXT (send next) is greater than HIGH_SEQ (highest sequence number sent). If this condition is true, it further checks if either FLAG_DATA_SACKED or is_dupack is set. If so, it sets FRTO (F-RTO) to 0, indicating that the loss was real. This change aligns with the correct behavior described in the F-RTO RFC 5682, which limits the number of probes sent to at most once.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug that can negatively impact the performance of TCP connections. It follows the correct behavior specified in the relevant RFC and improves the reliability of the TCP protocol. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the "nouveau_mm_init" function in the "mm.c" file and the "struct nouveau_mm" in the "mm.h" file. It introduces a change that allows the creation of zero-sized memory maps (mm) in the Nouveau DRM driver.

The patch adds a conditional check for the "length" parameter. If the length is non-zero, the mm's offset and length are calculated as before. However, if the length is zero, the mm's offset and length are not calculated, effectively creating a zero-sized mm.

This change is useful in scenarios where a given chipset may or may not have a specific resource, and it helps avoid the need to add checks for the mm's existence throughout the codebase.

The patch has been signed-off by the author and is relatively straightforward, introducing a useful enhancement without any apparent negative side effects. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting the patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons for my decision:

1) The patch suggests reverting a deprecation warning for SCTP_SNDRCV support. The author argues that the warning is unnecessary because SCTP_SNDRCV is a part of the user API (uapi) and is set in stone forever. This implies that there is no intention to remove or deprecate SCTP_SNDRCV in the future, making the warning redundant.

2) The patch also highlights the need for compatibility with older and newer kernels. By removing the deprecation warning, SCTP applications can continue to use SCTP_SNDRCV on older kernels and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO on newer kernels. This allows for a smoother transition for SCTP appliances that are migrating to newer kernels slowly.

3) The author mentions that some users may not have the opportunity to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users would encounter the deprecation warning and be stuck with older kernels. By reverting the warning, these users can continue using SCTP_SNDRCV without any disruption.

Considering these reasons, accepting the patch seems reasonable. However, it is important to note that this decision should be made in consultation with the Linux kernel maintainers and developers who have a deeper understanding of the codebase and its implications.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch adds a new function called get_random_long() which is similar to the existing get_random_int() function but returns an unsigned long instead of an unsigned int. This new function is necessary because the maximum value for the range of values used for entropy count in generating the random offset to the mmap_base address was set to 32 bits for 64-bit x86 systems. However, this value could be increased further, requiring more than the 32 bits of randomness provided by get_random_int(). The new get_random_long() function provides the necessary functionality for generating the required randomness.

Additionally, the patch fixes the shifting constant in mmap_rnd() to be an unsigned long, ensuring that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is important on x86 systems as its shift instruction uses a 5-bit mask for the shift operand, which meant that any value for mmap_rnd_bits over 31 acts as a no-op and effectively disables mmap_base randomization.

Finally, the patch replaces calls to get_random_int() with get_random_long() where appropriate, ensuring consistent usage of the new function.

Overall, the patch addresses the issues mentioned and improves the functionality of the Linux kernel, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 function in the ALSA pcm driver. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update is over half a buffer time. However, this condition can incorrectly treat certain cases as double acknowledged interrupts when the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and the time difference is just a little larger than half a buffer time.

The patch addresses this issue by adjusting the condition to consider a slightly larger time difference (hdelta) than half a buffer time. This change prevents false detection of double acknowledged interrupts in cases where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected.

Additionally, the patch acknowledges the inaccuracy of jiffies, which is used to measure time, due to its integer nature. By considering this inaccuracy, the patch ensures more accurate detection of double acknowledged interrupts.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the UniMAC reset in the bcm_sysport_resume() function. Without this reset, there can be various receive FIFO corruptions when coming out of a suspend cycle. This issue can lead to corrupted/duplicate packets being delivered towards the host CPU interface.

The patch also mentions that this issue can be reproduced on a crowded network and when Wake-on-LAN is enabled for the specific interface. It explains that the switch still forwards packets towards the host CPU interface, and leaving the UniMAC RX enable bit on is necessary to allow matching MagicPackets. However, during the resume function, there is a small window where the UniMAC receive is still enabled, but the RDMA and RBUF engines are not ready. This leads to packets getting stuck in the UniMAC RX FIFO and ultimately delivered as corrupted.

The patch reverts a previous commit that was causing a warning message in the acpi_battery_get_state() function. The reason for reverting the commit is that capping the 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity' is considered incorrect. Good battery firmwares allow 'capacity_now' to increase above 'full_charge_capacity' and update the latter when the battery is fully charged. By capping 'capacity_now', accurate capacity reporting is lost until charging is complete whenever 'full_charge_capacity' needs to be increased.

The patch fixes this issue by removing the line that caps 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity'. This ensures that accurate capacity reporting is maintained even when 'full_charge_capacity' needs to be increased.

The patch addresses a regression caused by commit 520bd7a8b415, which optimized boot time but changed the behavior of how mmcblk device indexes are assigned. Some platforms rely on fixed mmcblk device indexes, and this commit caused their rootfs to be unavailable at hardcoded paths. 

The proposed solution in the patch is to use the same index for the mmcblk device as for the corresponding mmc host device. This ensures that the probe order of mmc host devices determines the index for the mmcblk device. This updated behavior should meet the expectations of platforms that require fixed mmcblk device indexes. 

Additionally, the patch clarifies the relationship between the mmc host device, mmcblk device, and mmc block queue by using the same index for all three.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons for my decision:

1. The patch addresses a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs file system. The race occurs because the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set up after the inode hash table lock is dropped. This can lead to a situation where an existing inode is not found in the hash table if there is a race with the inode initialization code. The patch resolves this issue by setting up the location field sooner.

2. The find actor function, which is used for searching inodes, now only uses the location objectid to match inodes. This change ensures that the search for inodes is accurate and unaffected by the race condition.

3. The patch also modifies the btrfs_iget_locked function to use the location parameter instead of the objectid parameter. This change ensures consistency and avoids potential issues related to the race condition.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes to update the inode's i_ino field and the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field during inode initialization.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch aims to optimize the irq restore process in the s390 architecture by using the faster stosm instruction instead of the ssm instruction. It is mentioned that irqsave/irqrestore only deals with external and I/O interrupts, and irqrestore can transition only from disabled->disabled or disabled->enabled. 

The patch introduces a new macro, ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED, which represents the enabled state of interrupts. The arch_local_irq_restore function is modified to check if the flags parameter contains the ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED flag. If it does, the arch_local_irq_enable function is called to enable interrupts. 

The patch also modifies the paging_init function in arch/s390/mm/init.c to use the __arch_local_irq_stosm function instead of arch_local_irq_restore. 

Overall, the patch seems to provide a performance improvement by using the faster stosm instruction and ensures that irqrestore only enables interrupts when transitioning from disabled->enabled. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a problem where the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

The patch fixes this issue by passing the pointer to the lock_flags variable to the qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() function, allowing it to update the flags correctly.

The patch also includes the necessary Fixes and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it addresses a specific issue and has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Therefore, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a locking regression introduced by a previous commit, which caused a deadlock in the mars-nwe (NetWare emulator) scenario. The issue arises when a recvmsg syscall blocks waiting for new data, preventing any data from being sent on the same socket with sendmsg because ipx_recvmsg() sleeps with the socket locked.

The patch resolves this issue by only keeping the socket locked while actually working with the socket data and releasing it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram(). This ensures that a blocking recvmsg does not block a concurrent sendmsg.

The patch adjusts the thermal protection requirements for certain graphics processing units (GPUs) in the Linux kernel. It removes the requirement for clock gating for thermal protection on rv770 and newer GPUs, and instead only requires the utilization of a thermal sensor. This change simplifies the code and improves efficiency.

The patch modifies the initialization functions for different GPU models (btc_dpm.c, cypress_dpm.c, ni_dpm.c, rv770_dpm.c, and si_dpm.c) to update the thermal protection setting based on the presence of a thermal sensor. The condition for enabling thermal protection is changed from checking both "gfx_clock_gating" and "int_thermal_type" to only checking "int_thermal_type". This change ensures that thermal protection is enabled as long as a thermal sensor is present, regardless of the clock gating setting.
