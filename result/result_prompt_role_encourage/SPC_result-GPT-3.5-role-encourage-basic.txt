This patch fixes a bug in the TCP implementation related to F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) probes. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes if the next ACK advances SND_UNA and does not sack new packets. This behavior can lead to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver's side.

The patch modifies the code to correctly handle the F-RTO probes. It checks if the SND_NXT (next sequence number to be sent) is greater than the HIGH_SEQ (highest sequence number sent so far). If it is, the patch checks if the FLAG_DATA_SACKED or is_dupack flags are set. If either of these flags is set, it means that the loss was real, and the F-RTO counter (tp->frto) is reset to 0. This aligns with the behavior specified in RFC 5682, which states that F-RTO probes should be sent at most once.

Overall, this patch improves the correctness of the TCP implementation and prevents unnecessary retransmissions, leading to better performance and reduced HoL blocking. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

This patch modifies the acpi_find_child_device() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change covers a special case where some devices have a _HID (or _CID) returning valid ACPI/PNP device IDs, which is disallowed by the spec. The ASL writers' expectation appears to be that the OS will match devices without a valid ACPI/PNP device ID against a given bus address first.

By making devices with ACPI/PNP device IDs look less attractive, the patch allows the other device with the same _ADR value (that may not have a valid device ID) to be matched going forward. Although this change violates the spec, it is a best effort to handle this specific case.

The patch has been suggested by Mika Westerberg and signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki. It has also been tested by Hans de Goede.

The patch reverts a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting the patch is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable. It works for some people with certain combinations of USB host controllers, but for others, it puts the device to sleep and it will not wake up for any event.

The events that may not wake up the device include important ones like HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request. Although there were patches to the xHCI USB controller that fixed this issue for some people, it did not work for everyone. The cause of the problem is not known at the moment, and the safest action is to revert the patch.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is recommended to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 function in the ALSA PCM driver. The current condition incorrectly treats certain interrupts as double acknowledged when the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and the time from the last update is just a little larger than half a buffer time.

The patch adjusts the condition to account for the inaccuracy of jiffies, which is used to measure time. By adding 1 to the comparison, it ensures that the hdelta value is slightly larger than half a buffer time, preventing false positives for double acknowledged interrupts.

This modification improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the PCM driver, which is important for proper audio playback and recording. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses both issues by setting msg_namelen to 0 early in the function. This ensures that the uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable is not leaked to userland and that the msg_namelen is correctly updated later if needed.

Based on this analysis, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This patch is aimed at disabling PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. The reason for this is that if the default PM Domain using PM_CLK is used for PM runtime, the real Clock Domain cannot be registered from DT later. The patch replaces the explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT, which simplifies the platform logic. Backwards-compatibility with old DTs is provided by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT. The default PM Domain is still needed for backwards-compatibility with old DTs that lack PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy (non-DT) ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support, and legacy SuperH.

Explanation: The patch suggests using truncate_pagecache() instead of truncate_pagecache_range() in the collapse range function in the ext4 file system. The reason for this change is that truncate_pagecache() not only truncates the page cache from the given offset to the end of the file but also gets rid of private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range. This is necessary because the end of the file is going to be shifted. The patch has been signed-off by Lukas Czerner and Theodore Ts'o.

Based on the provided information, the patch seems to be a valid improvement to the ext4 file system. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: The patch fixes a bug where the s3c_hsotg_phy_disable function is called multiple times, causing the phy reference counter to go below zero. The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions. The reasoning behind this is that s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Similarly, s3c_hsotg_remove should only be called after udc_stop, so there is no need to disable the phy again there. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers and is targeted for the stable branch. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: 

This patch fixes a bug in the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() functions where the use count of md5sig_pool is increased for each tcp md5sig peer. However, tcp_v4_clear_md5_list() assumes that multiple tcp md5sig peers only hold one reference to md5sig_pool. This can lead to a memory leak if tcp_alloc_md5sig_pool() fails to allocate memory.

The patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first tcp md5sig peer. Additionally, it adds checks to free md5sig_pool if entries4 or entries6 is 0.

This patch fixes a problem where pfmemalloc pages can leak to non-pfmemalloc users. It addresses a scenario where a normal allocation request is made and there are no objects in the per-cpu cache and no node-partial slab. In this case, slab_alloc enters the slow path and new_slab_objects() is called, which may return a PFMEMALLOC page. However, the current user is not allowed to access PFMEMALLOC pages, so deactivate_slab() is called to return an object from the PFMEMALLOC page. 

The problem occurs when another request from normal allocation is made and new_slab_objects() is called again. This time, get_partial() is called and retrieves a partial slab that was just deactivated but is a pfmemalloc page. One object is extracted from it and then re-deactivated. This "deactivate -> re-get in get_partial -> re-deactivate" scenario can occur repeatedly, leading to improper access to PFMEMALLOC pages and performance degradation due to frequent deactivation.

The patch changes get_partial_node() to consider pfmemalloc_match() and prevent the "deactivate -> re-get in get_partial" scenario. Instead, new_slab() is called. This ensures that access to PFMEMALLOC pages is properly restricted and avoids the performance degradation caused by frequent deactivation.
