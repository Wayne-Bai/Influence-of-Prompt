security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). It fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the power_supply driver. The vulnerability occurs during the probe of the bq27x00_battery driver, where the power_supply_register() function is called. The function returns a pointer to a newly allocated structure, but before returning, it calls back the get_property() method provided by the driver through uevent. At this point, the driver probe is still in progress and the driver has not assigned the pointer to the power supply to its local variables. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference from the get_property() function.

The patch addresses this issue by incrementing the atomic use counter at the end of power_supply_register(). This ensures that power_supply_get_property() will return -ENODEV, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.

The patch also mentions that it has an impact on the first uevent sent from the power supply, as it will not contain properties from the power supply. However, the uevent with properties will be sent later after indicating that the power supply has changed.

Overall, this patch addresses a security vulnerability and should be classified as a security patch (SRP).
