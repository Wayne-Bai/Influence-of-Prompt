Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the z13 architecture in the s390 facilities. This patch modifies the facility_defs structure in the facilities_src.h file to include the load-and-zero-rightmost-byte facility and load/store-on-condition facility 2.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the provided patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding support for a new architecture feature rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to NFS remount attempts. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds additional checks in the `nfs_compare_remount_data` function to compare the `version` and `minorversion` fields of the `data` structure with the corresponding fields in the `nfss->nfs_client` structure. If these fields do not match, the remount attempt is rejected.

2. The patch also updates the `nfs_remount` function to set the `version` and `minorversion` fields of the `data` structure to the appropriate values.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to NFS remount attempts. It ensures that the `version` and `minorversion` fields are correctly compared and set during remount operations. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix since it does not address a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The patch addresses a bug related to accessing __iomem directly, which could lead to potential issues on architectures that don't support MMIO.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: The patch ensures that the code works correctly by copying the channel type into a temporary buffer. This prevents potential data corruption that could occur when accessing __iomem directly.

3. The fix is not trivial: The patch involves modifying the code logic and introducing a temporary buffer to handle the channel type. It is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new bugs or issues. The code logic is improved to handle the channel type correctly.

Based on these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and improve the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debugging enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch adds debug messages using the BT_DBG macro to the functions l2cap_sock_shutdown() and __l2cap_wait_ack() in the l2cap_sock.c file.

false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address duplicated callback functions in the codec driver and component driver for the ssm2518 codec.
2. The duplicated functions were initially copied from the codec driver to the component driver during register timing.
3. The patch proposes moving these functions from the codec driver to the component driver.
4. The changes are made in the "ssm2518_codec_driver" structure, specifically in the "controls," "num_controls," "dapm_widgets," "num_dapm_widgets," "dapm_routes," and "num_dapm_routes" fields.
5. The functions are now placed under the "component_driver" structure within the "ssm2518_codec_driver" structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a code duplication issue and improving the organization of the code by moving the functions to the appropriate location. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by three individuals: Jesse Barnes, Rodrigo Vivi, and Daniel Vetter.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the vlv_infoframe_enabled function in the intel_hdmi.c file. It adds a check for the port using the intel_dig_port structure and compares it with the port value obtained from the VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK. If the port matches, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between val and VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE. Otherwise, it returns false.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to the VLV platform. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not appear to fix any critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix.

Based on the available information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, please note that a more thorough analysis and additional information about the bug being fixed would be required to make a definitive decision.
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `attach_one_default_qdisc` function in the `sch_generic.c` file.

2. The condition `if (dev->tx_queue_len && !(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE))` is added to check if `dev->tx_queue_len` is non-zero and the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is not set in `dev->priv_flags`.

3. If the condition is true, a default qdisc is created using `qdisc_create_dflt` and assigned to `qdisc`.

4. If the condition is false, the `noqueue_qdisc` is assigned to `qdisc`.

5. The `attach_default_qdiscs` function is modified to include the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag check in the condition `if (!netif_is_multiqueue(dev) || dev->tx_queue_len == 0 || dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE)`.

6. If the condition is true, the `attach_one_default_qdisc` function is called for each tx queue using `netdev_for_each_tx_queue`, and the `qdisc` is assigned to `txq->qdisc_sleeping`.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be fixing a real and critical bug related to handling the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag. It ensures that the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is properly considered when creating and attaching default qdiscs.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that switches from using `module_init` and `module_exit` to `module_platform_driver` for the `gpio_ir_recv` driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds error checking for the `dev_alloc_skb()` call in the `amsdu_to_msdu()` function. If the allocation fails, the patch breaks out of the loop. This is a good practice as it ensures that the driver handles allocation failures properly.

2. The patch also adds error checking for the `skb_clone()` call in the `recvbuf2recvframe()` function. If the cloning fails, the patch returns `_FAIL`. This is important to prevent potential issues with using a NULL pointer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver. It improves error handling and prevents potential crashes or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that makes the function `hp_amp_power_on` static. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting to table-based control initialization. The patch removes the call to `snd_soc_add_codec_controls` and instead initializes the `controls` and `num_controls` fields directly in the `soc_codec_dev_ak4642` and `soc_codec_dev_ak4648` structures.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character ("\n") to the end of two dev_err messages in the s390/dasd driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch modifies the code in the hns driver to use fwnode_handle instead of device_node for device matching and retrieval. This change ensures uniformity in the usage of device_node and is considered a suitable method for DT (Device Tree) cases.

The patch also updates the hnae_get_handle function to use fwnode_handle instead of device_node for finding the AE (Accelerated Ethernet) device. This change ensures consistency and avoids potential issues with device matching.

Additionally, the patch modifies the hns_nic_dev_probe function to use fwnode_handle instead of device_node for retrieving the AE handle. This change ensures that the correct handle is obtained and avoids potential errors.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to the usage of device_node and improves the code's consistency. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check. The patch removes the check for `dst == NULL` in the `ip6t_SYNPROXY` module, as `ip6_route_output()` is guaranteed to never return a NULL pointer.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch switches over to the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. This is a good practice as it ensures the use of standardized and maintained functions.

2. The patch removes the TODO item related to the TMU clocksource. This indicates that the patch addresses a long-standing issue, which is a positive sign.

3. The patch replaces the calculation of shift, mult, max_delta_ns, and min_delta_ns with a call to clockevents_config(). This simplifies the code and makes it more maintainable.

4. The patch also updates the clockevents_register_device() call to clockevents_config_and_register(). This ensures that the clock event device is properly configured and registered.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by switching to standardized functions and resolving a long-standing issue. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the staging IIO (Industrial I/O) drivers for the ADIS16209 and ADIS16240 accelerometers. The patch replaces the custom event handler functions `adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll` and `adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll` with the generic function `iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll` for handling data ready triggers.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is fixing an uninitialized variable warning in the `ath9k_has_tx_pending()` function in the `ath9k` driver. The warning suggests that the variable `npend` may be used uninitialized in the function.

Since this warning indicates a potential issue that could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect program execution, it is important to fix it. However, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It only addresses a warning related to an uninitialized variable.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a minor code quality improvement rather than fixing a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new function `calibration_delay_done()` with a dummy implementation. This function is used to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and can be used by architectures to stop accepting delay timer registrations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the i2c-brcmstb driver. The patch replaces the manual calculation of the address with a new helper function, i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg, which simplifies the code and improves readability.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for VB2_DMABUF in the davinci vpbe driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for VB2_DMABUF in the vpbe_display_probe() function of the davinci vpbe driver.

2. The change modifies the q->io_modes field by adding VB2_DMABUF to the existing VB2_MMAP and VB2_USERPTR flags.

3. VB2_DMABUF is a flag that indicates support for exporting buffers as DMA-BUFs, which allows for sharing buffers between different devices or subsystems.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds a new feature to the davinci vpbe driver by enabling support for exporting buffers as DMA-BUFs. This is not a critical bug fix, but rather an enhancement to the driver's functionality.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a manual swapping operation with the `swap()` macro defined in `kernel.h`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (replacing a few lines of code with a macro), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing superfluous address-of operators and unneeded casts. It also updates the printk format specifier to use %p for pointers.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the `ioctl` function with `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. This change is specific to the `radio-bcm2048` driver and does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the variable name `PIDVEC_SIZE` to `max_items` in the `f2fs` file system's `gang_lookup_pids` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As per the criteria, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant condition check. The condition `(oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID)` is already checked in the previous line, so there is no need to check it again. The patch simply removes the redundant check and updates the code accordingly.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is in line with the driver-core's support for synchronous self-deletion of attributes and the removal of the asynchronous mechanism.

2. The patch ensures that the "delete" behavior is synchronous by directly calling `scsi_remove_device()` after removing the file using `device_remove_file_self()`. This simplifies the code and eliminates the need for the roundabout approach previously used.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these observations, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial cleanup without any functional changes. It removes an unnecessary forward declaration and does not fix any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a local variable "handle" in the acpi_pci_root_add() function. This local variable is assigned the value of "device->handle" and is then used in place of "device->handle" throughout the function.

The purpose of introducing this local variable seems to be for economy of expression, as it reduces the repetition of "device->handle" in the code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code refactoring change aimed at improving code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `platform_device_put` function call in the error path of the `raumfeld_audio_init` function. This fix ensures that the platform device is properly released in case of an error during the `platform_device_add` call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for the McASPs on the davinci dm646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and have corresponding IRQ numbers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about a bug, error, or issue that it resolves. It simply adds interrupt resources for the McASPs.

Without additional context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in a stable release. Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only adds an optional check for the "simple-audio-routing" property before parsing the DAPM routes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to inconsistent indenting in the i915_error_state_to_str() function. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to add an option to skip sync on DMA map in the arch/avr32 folder. It mentions that the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC was not consistent across all DMA APIs in the arch/arm folder, and this change is meant to correct that for consistent behavior.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the avr32_dma_map_page() and avr32_dma_map_sg() functions in the arch/avr32/mm/dma-coherent.c file.

   In the avr32_dma_map_page() function:
   - The patch adds a condition to check if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set in the attrs parameter.
   - If the flag is not set, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA memory.

   In the avr32_dma_map_sg() function:
   - The patch adds a similar condition to check if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set in the attrs parameter.
   - If the flag is set, it skips the synchronization and continues to the next scatterlist entry.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to improve consistency in the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC across DMA APIs in the arch/avr32 folder. It does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively trivial, as they involve adding conditional checks and skipping synchronization.

   Therefore, considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please let me know if you need any further analysis or clarification.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a calculation with the DIV_ROUND_UP macro. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the PCTV 340eSE device to the dib0700 driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a USB ID for the PCTV 340eSE device to the dib0700_usb_id_table. This is a necessary step to ensure that the device is recognized and supported by the driver.

2. The patch also adds a corresponding entry for the PCTV 340eSE device in the dvb_usb_device_properties structure. This allows the driver to handle the device correctly and provide the necessary functionality.

3. Additionally, the patch updates the USB_PID_PINNACLE_PCTV340E_SE definition in dvb-usb-ids.h to match the USB PID of the PCTV 340eSE device.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding support for a new device to the existing driver. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the name of a signal from "DE" to "DISP" in the rcar-du driver for the DRM subsystem. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the IRQ handler function `bq27xxx_battery_irq_handler_thread` to the appropriate section in the code. This change resolves a warning related to the handler being defined but not used when the `CONFIG_BQ27XXX_I2C` configuration is not enabled.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only corrects the indentation in the struct amdgpu_ring definition. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a check of the status_code in the ERSP_IU structure in the nvme_fc_fcpio_done function in the fc.c file of the nvme host driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

From the patch context, it seems that the check of the status_code is being added to the existing code. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the bug being addressed or the impact it has on the system. 

To make an informed decision, we would need more details about the bug being fixed, the severity of the issue, and any potential risks associated with the patch. Without this information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further analysis and additional information would be required to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply removes the private copy of `struct net_device_stats` in `struct port_info` and uses the stats from `struct net_device` instead.

Since this patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ipmmu_probe` function in the `shmobile-ipmmu.c` file.

2. The patch removes the call to `ipmmu_iommu_init` and replaces it with a return statement that calls `ipmmu_iommu_init` directly.

3. The return value of `ipmmu_iommu_init` is now being returned by the `ipmmu_probe` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue by not ignoring the return value of `ipmmu_iommu_init`. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity or impact of this change.

To make a final decision, I would need more context about the potential consequences of ignoring the return value of `ipmmu_iommu_init` and the implications of this change in terms of build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical bugs.

Please provide additional information or context to help me make a more informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds the "rw" parameter to the "__extent_read_full_page" function, which is then passed to the "submit_extent_page" function. This change allows the caller to specify the read/write mode for the extent page submission.

2. The "extent_read_full_page" function is modified to pass the "rw" parameter to "__extent_read_full_page" and "submit_one_bio" functions. This change ensures that the correct read/write mode is used when submitting the bio.

3. The "write_one_eb" function is modified to set the "rw" variable based on the value of "epd->sync_io". If "epd->sync_io" is true, the "rw" variable is set to "WRITE_SYNC" with the addition of the "REQ_META" flag. This change ensures that metadata writes are properly tagged.

4. The "extent_readpages" function is modified to pass the "rw" parameter to "__extent_read_full_page" function. This change ensures that the correct read/write mode is used when reading extent pages.

5. The "read_extent_buffer_pages" function is modified to pass the "rw" parameter to "__extent_read_full_page" and "submit_one_bio" functions. This change ensures that the correct read/write mode is used when reading extent buffer pages.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be addressing a specific issue related to metadata IO and priority inversion when using IO throttling cgroups. It introduces the "REQ_META" flag to properly tag metadata IO and ensures the correct read/write mode is used in various functions.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to metadata IO and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding initial support for the GP104 chipset in the Nouveau driver. However, the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial change as it only adds a single line to the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for distinguishing between i.MX23 and i.MX28 SoC variants in the MXS LRADC driver. This fix is necessary to make the touchscreen work on i.MX23. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a specific fix for a hardware variant distinction.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix default UVD context size" and is signed-off by Christian König, reviewed by Leo Liu and Alex Deucher, and signed-off again by Alex Deucher.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the "amdgpu_uvd_cs_msg_decode" function in the "amdgpu_uvd.c" file.

3. The specific change is on line 437, where the variable "min_ctx_size" is initialized to "~0" instead of "0".

4. The purpose of this change is to set the default UVD (Unified Video Decoder) context size to the maximum possible value, indicating that context buffers should be denied by default.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to the default UVD context size in the AMDGPU driver. It is not a trivial fix, as it changes the default behavior and could potentially impact the stability or security of the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the ARM shmobile rcar-gen2 platform. The patch adds more register documentation and includes some changes to the register definitions and related code.

1. The patch fixes a kernel warning related to suspicious RCU usage in the `net/sched/cls_tcindex.c` file.

2. The warning indicates that there is a suspicious `rcu_dereference_check()` usage at line 84 of `net/sched/cls_tcindex.c`.

3. The patch modifies the `tcindex_classify()` function by changing the `rcu_dereference()` call to `rcu_dereference_bh()`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a real issue related to RCU usage and fixes a kernel warning. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the display of mount options in /proc/mounts. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: It adds error messages to be printed when firmware fails to be requested in the case of platform data being used. This indicates that there is a potential problem with firmware retrieval.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on adding meaningful error messages rather than making trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: It does not modify any existing functionality or introduce any new code that could potentially cause regressions or other problems.

4. The patch improves code readability: By distinguishing between the error messages for device tree and platform data cases, it provides clearer information about the specific scenario in which the firmware retrieval failed.

Overall, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it addresses a real issue and does not contain trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel panic issue caused by a recursive recovery during boot. The patch checks the state of the wl->state variable before queuing a new recovery, ensuring that the hardware is not already stopped.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to a kernel panic. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` status of the DCE (Display Core Engine) IP block accordingly.

2. The `dce_v10_0_soft_reset` function is modified to check if the DCE IP block is hung before performing a soft reset. If the IP block is not hung, the function returns without performing the reset.

3. The `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure is updated to include the new `check_soft_reset` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds functionality to handle display hangs and perform a soft reset if necessary. This can be considered a critical bug fix as display hangs can lead to system instability and data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a "trivial" fix that falls under the category of spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "HID: wacom: Move Graphire report header check." It suggests moving a specific check related to the Wacom Graphire device.

2. The comment in the patch explains that the check is valid only for the Wacom Graphire device, as its reports always start with 0x03. However, the Intuos4 WL high-speed reports begin with 0x04, so the check would incorrectly filter out valid reports.

3. The patch modifies the code to include an additional check for the Wacom Graphire device. If the report header is 0x03, it calls the wacom_gr_parse_report() function. Otherwise, it logs an error message and returns 0.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that the author and another contributor have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The change appears to address a specific issue related to the Wacom Graphire device and ensures that valid reports are not filtered out.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to fix a specific bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the provided information:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "staging: lustre: fix socklnd issues found by Klocwork Insight tool." It suggests that the patch aims to fix issues identified by the Klocwork Insight tool in the staging/lustre/lnet/klnds/socklnd/socklnd.c file.

2. Bug Description: The patch addresses a null pointer issue where the 'best_iface' pointer, which is obtained from line 802, may be dereferenced at line 832.

3. Patch Details: The patch adds a line of code to check the validity of the 'best_iface' pointer before dereferencing it. The added line is: "LASSERT(best_iface);"

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to a null pointer dereference issue. The patch also includes a proper check to ensure the validity of the 'best_iface' pointer before accessing it.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to a hang or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the tpic2810 GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new function called `tpic2810_set` to the tpic2810 GPIO driver. This function is not defined in the original code, so it seems to be a necessary addition to fix the bug.

2. The `tpic2810_direction_output` function is modified to call the newly added `tpic2810_set` function with the `chip`, `offset`, and `value` parameters. This change ensures that the proper output level is set when the `.direction_output` callback is called.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug in the tpic2810 GPIO driver by ensuring that the proper output level is set. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue.

Since the patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only removes some unnecessary function calls, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug in the acpi_power_meter driver that causes the kernel to crash when it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. This bug can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The patch replaces the use of the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro. The WARN() macro generates a warning message but does not crash the kernel. This change ensures that the kernel can handle unexpected conditions gracefully without causing a crash.

3. The patch includes appropriate error messages in the WARN() calls to provide useful information about the unexpected conditions encountered. This can help with debugging and identifying the root cause of the issue.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing a real and critical bug that can impact system stability and security.

Based on these points, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a critical bug that can cause a crash and does not include any trivial changes. Therefore, the recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the target_core_device.c file, which is responsible for setting up the virtual_lun0 device.

2. The change in line 1544 initializes the 'buf' array with the value "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1". This change sets the configuration parameters for the virtual_lun0 device.

3. The previous code in line 1557 that initializes 'buf' with "rd_pages=8" is removed since it is redundant.

4. The 'buf' array is then passed to the set_configfs_dev_params() function to set the configuration parameters for the device.

5. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address a configuration issue related to the virtual_lun0 device.

6. Although the change is not critical, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it improves the configuration of the virtual_lun0 device.

7. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the configuration of the virtual_lun0 device, even though it does not fix a critical bug or security issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant assignment for the "gpio->da9052" variable in the "da9052_gpio_probe" function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that staticizes some symbols in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for setting a plane's rotation property from userspace in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a set_property hook for the planes in the DRM subsystem. This hook is required to support DRM_IOCTL_MODE_OBJ_SETPROPERTY for the rotation property. This indicates that the patch aims to fix a functionality issue related to setting the rotation property.

2. The set_property hook is set to drm_atomic_helper_plane_set_property(). This function is a helper function provided by the DRM subsystem to handle plane property setting in an atomic manner. This suggests that the patch is leveraging existing infrastructure to implement the required functionality.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to the malidp_de_plane_funcs structure, specifically adding the set_property hook to the struct drm_plane_funcs. This ensures that the new functionality is properly integrated into the DRM subsystem.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug related to setting the rotation property for planes in the DRM subsystem. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the error code -ENOSYS with -EOPNOTSUPP for two stub operations in the greybus audio_apbridgea driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As a result, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Qualcomm's PTM v1.1 peripheral ID to the coresight-etm3x driver.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite". It suggests updating file times only if page_mkwrite is not set and calls file_update_time manually.

2. Patch Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by multiple individuals, including Yang Sheng, James Simmons, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. Patch Location: The patch is applied to the file "drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/llite/llite_mmap.c" at line 369.

4. Code Changes: The patch adds a call to the function "file_update_time(vma->vm_file)" before the "do-while" loop in the "ll_page_mkwrite" function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to updating file times in the Lustre staging driver. However, without further context or knowledge about the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to review the bug report or the discussion on the patch in the provided links (Intel-bug-id and Reviewed-on). This additional information would help assess the severity of the bug, its impact on system stability, and whether it qualifies as a critical issue that warrants inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted or not. Further investigation is required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that makes the `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs` arrays const. The patch also updates the arrays declaration, `find_freq_tables()`, and its callsites.

The patch is suggested by Joe Perches and signed-off by Fabian Frederick and Rafael J. Wysocki. It modifies the `pxa2xx-cpufreq.c` file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that makes the arrays const.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "staging: comedi: s626: remove I2CR and I2CW macros." It suggests removing the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros, which expand to the I2C read and write addresses, respectively. These macros are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `I2Cread` function in the `s626.c` file and the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros in the `s626.h` file.

3. Analysis:
   The purpose of the patch is to remove the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros and expand them in place. This change eliminates the need for the macros and simplifies the code.

   The `I2Cread` function is modified to use the `devpriv->I2CAdrs` variable directly instead of the `I2CR` macro. Similarly, the `I2C_B2` macro in the `I2Chandshake` function call is modified to use `devpriv->I2CAdrs` instead of `I2CW`.

   The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a code cleanup change, removing unnecessary macros and simplifying the code.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues. It seems to be a trivial code cleanup change. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the kernel/sched/core.c file. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds the flag ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK to the enqueue_task() function calls in several places: do_set_cpus_allowed(), set_user_nice(), sched_setnuma(), and sched_move_task().

2. The comment in the patch states that ENQUEUE_RESTORE should always have ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK because DEQUEUE_SAVE will have done an update_rq_clock().

3. The patch modifies the enqueue_task() calls by adding the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the existing ENQUEUE_RESTORE flag.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the enqueue_task() function calls. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, additional information such as the bug description, the impact of the bug, and any relevant test results would be necessary. Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver. This change allows for different clock names on multiple platforms and allows the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name. This is a good practice for portability and maintainability.

2. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi, Roger Quadros, and Kishon Vijay Abraham I. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has received approval from experts in the field.

3. The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they address the clock names used in the driver, which can have a significant impact on the functionality of the USB PHY.

4. The patch handles the case where the clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" are not found by falling back to the old clock names "usb_phy_cm_clk32k" and "usb_otg_ss_refclk960m" respectively. This ensures backward compatibility and provides a warning message to fix the device tree source (DTS) if the old clock names are used.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to clock names in the phy-omap-usb2 driver and provides a more generic and flexible solution. It does not contain trivial fixes and has undergone a review process. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces a new callback function `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio-pca953x` driver. This function retrieves the direction of a GPIO pin from the hardware. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a new feature addition rather than a bug fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the initcall_sync variants in init.h to fix build errors. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements:
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint PCH
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint LP PCH

2. The purpose of these WARN_ON statements is to issue a warning if the detected PCH is not paired with an ULT (Ultra Low TDP) CPU.

3. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical bug. It is more of a sanity check to ensure that the detected PCH is paired with the correct CPU.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "oh, that's not good" issue rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the conditional logic to check for an error code instead of a success code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple code cleanup that does not introduce any functional changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a checkpatch issue related to alignment mismatch between open parenthesis.
2. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
3. The changes in the patch are limited to the drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/ni_labpc.c file, which suggests that it is specific to the ni_labpc driver.
4. The changes in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
5. The changes in the patch do not introduce any new functionality but rather improve the code's readability and maintainability.

Based on these observations, the patch seems to address a non-trivial issue and does not introduce any potential risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and consistency. The patch only changes the line breaks and indentation of the code, without addressing any real bug or critical issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a function. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash due to a null dereference and adds error handling for a failed kzalloc allocation. This patch does not seem to address any critical bugs that cause build errors, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it does not address any significant issues.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "ASoC: ak4642: fixup channels_min" and it mentions fixing a channel mismatch issue in the ak4642 codec driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the "ak4642_dai" structure in the ak4642 codec driver. Specifically, it changes the "channels_min" value for both playback and capture streams from 1 to 2.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a channel mismatch issue in the ak4642 codec driver. It ensures that both playback and capture streams have a minimum of 2 channels instead of 1. This change aligns the configuration with the hardware capabilities of the ak4642 codec.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a channel mismatch, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug.

5. Triviality Assessment:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the channel mismatch issue.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch updates the virtio_net driver to use the new ethtool API functions, specifically the {get|set}_link_ksettings functions, instead of the deprecated {get|set}_settings functions.

This change is important because it ensures that the driver is using the latest and recommended API, which improves compatibility and maintainability. It also avoids potential issues that may arise from using deprecated functions.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue by updating the driver to use the new API, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch replaces the usage of smp_mb() with smp_store_mb/release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin/end() functions in arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c.

2. Code Changes: The patch replaces the smp_mb() call with smp_store_mb() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() function and replaces the smp_mb() call with smp_store_release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() function.

3. Purpose: The purpose of these changes is to ensure proper memory ordering and synchronization when modifying the vcpu->mode variable.

4. Impact Analysis: The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a performance optimization by replacing smp_mb() with more specific memory barrier functions.

5. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a performance optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch aims to document the optional print_limit argument for the '--call-graph' command line option in the perf report tool. It also suggests using strtoul() to parse the option since its type is u32.

The changes made in the patch seem to be addressing documentation and parsing improvements for the '--call-graph' option. These changes do not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes do not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that does not meet the required criteria. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue related to deleting only created queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch uses the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues. This change ensures that the controller returns an invalid queue identifier error to commands if a queue wasn't created.

3. The reported-by field indicates that the issue was reported by Saar Gross.

4. The patch is signed-off by Keith Busch and reviewed by Christoph Hellwig.

5. The code changes in the patch involve modifying the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function.

6. The variable `queues` is introduced to store the value of `dev->online_queues - 1`.

7. The loop in the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function iterates twice, with `pass` being the loop counter.

8. The variable `sent` is initialized to 0, and `i` is initialized to `queues`.

9. The `reinit_completion` function is called to reinitialize the completion structure `dev->ioq_wait`.

10. The `retry` label indicates a retry point in the code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to deleting only created queues in the NVMe driver. It introduces a change to use the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues, which improves correctness. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the blackfin PTP driver. The patch converts the gettime and settime functions to use struct timespec64 instead of struct timespec, allowing the driver to handle 64-bit nanosecond registers and be ready for the year 2038.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to time handling and ensures future compatibility, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new macro called VA_START to replace the lengthy expression (UL(0xffffffffffffffff) << VA_BITS) used in multiple places. The purpose of this change is to improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." mentioned in the criteria.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the bcm-kona GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` which is called when an IRQ is started. This function locks the hardware IRQ and checks if it was successfully locked. If not, it logs an error message.

2. The patch also adds a new function `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown` which is called when an IRQ is shut down. This function masks the IRQ and unlocks the hardware IRQ.

3. The `bcm_gpio_irq_chip` structure is updated to include the new `irq_startup` and `irq_shutdown` function pointers.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to locking and unlocking hardware IRQs in the bcm-kona GPIO driver. It does not introduce any trivial changes and appears to be a critical fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call initializes the "icount" structure to zero, but since the structure is allocated using kzalloc, it is already zeroed out. Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for reading from a video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a functional enhancement that can improve the usability of the camera driver.

2. The patch includes a debug line, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

5. The patch does not modify any existing functionality or behavior, but rather adds a new feature.

Considering these points, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() in the rcutorture test. This change aims to test the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it seems to be a test enhancement for the rcutorture tool.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a compile issue in the obd_mount.c file of the Lustre staging driver. The issue is related to the variable "index" not being initialized before it is used in the lmd_make_exclusion function.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it can be considered a real and critical bug. However, it does not seem to cause any oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a non-trivial issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check that is not doing anything useful. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the spi-armada-3700 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the removal of the ".owner" field.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). The patch description does not provide any details about the bug being fixed or the impact it has on the system. Additionally, the patch itself only adds a handler function to a command complete event, without any context or explanation of why this change is necessary.

To make an informed decision, more information is needed about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release (e.g., fixing a critical bug, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, etc.).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the OVSP_LOCAL constant from a 16-bit unsigned integer (__u16) to a 32-bit unsigned integer (__u32). This change aligns the OVSP_LOCAL constant with the new 32-bit OVS ports.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless initialization of the variable 'ret'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch updates AR9485 initvals for the ath9k driver.

2. Change made: The change modifies the value at address 0x0000a2c4 in the ar9485_1_1_baseband_postamble array from 0x00158d18 to 0x00058d18.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making a specific modification to the AR9485 initvals in the ath9k driver. However, the patch does not provide any information about the bug or issue it is addressing. Without further context or details, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the specified criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, if additional information is provided regarding the bug or issue being addressed, a more accurate assessment can be made.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch replaces the use of kmalloc() with kzalloc() in the idmapper code of the NFS subsystem. This change ensures that the allocated memory is zeroed, eliminating the need for an explicit memset() call later on.

2. The patch removes the unnecessary memset() calls for the 'im' and 'msg' structures, as they are no longer required due to the use of kzalloc().

3. The patch also updates the allocation of 'data' in the nfs_idmap_legacy_upcall() function to use kzalloc() instead of kmalloc(). This ensures that the allocated memory is zeroed.

Overall, this patch improves the code by using kzalloc() instead of kmalloc() to allocate zeroed memory, which simplifies the code and reduces the chances of potential bugs related to uninitialized memory.

Since this patch fixes a potential issue and improves the code without introducing any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds error handling for panel initialization in the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential issue related to panel initialization.

2. The patch also groups mutex initialization at a single place, which improves code organization and maintainability.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ricardo Neri and Tomi Valkeinen, who are associated with the OMAPDSS HDMI driver.

4. The changes made in the patch are within the hdmi.c file, specifically in the omapdss_hdmihw_probe() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to panel initialization in the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. It also improves code organization by grouping mutex initialization. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the plane state during initialization in the "intel_find_initial_plane_obj" function.
2. It sets the primary framebuffer (fb) to the provided fb.
3. It updates the crtc and primary plane state to point to the intel_crtc base.
4. It updates the plane mask of the intel_crtc base state to include the primary plane.
5. It updates the frontbuffer bits of the obj to include the primary plane.
6. In the "intel_modeset_gem_init" function, it initializes the primary framebuffer to NULL and updates the crtc and primary plane state to NULL.
7. It updates the plane mask of the crtc state to exclude the primary plane.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be making necessary updates to the plane state during initialization. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be relatively trivial and do not address any major issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch moves duplicated callback functions from the codec driver to the component driver in the ASoC subsystem for the wm9713 codec. This change improves code organization and eliminates the need for the quick-hack of copying functions during register timing.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it addresses a real issue related to code duplication, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that modifies the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions in `net/mac802154/iface.c`. 

The patch changes the logic for incrementing and decrementing the `open_count` variable. In the `mac802154_slave_open` function, instead of incrementing `open_count` and checking if it was the first open, it now checks if `open_count` is zero and increments it afterwards. Similarly, in the `mac802154_slave_close` function, it decrements `open_count` before checking if it is zero.

Based on the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a cleanup patch that does not address any of these issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the use of WARN_ON() in the srpt_abort_cmd() function in the ib_srpt.c file.

2. The current code uses WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state"), which is not the intended usage of WARN_ON(). While it will work, it is not clear what the actual state value is.

3. The patch replaces the incorrect usage with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state), which provides more useful information by showing the actual "state" value.

4. This change improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message, making it easier to understand and debug any unexpected command states.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

6. The fix addresses a potential issue that could lead to unexpected command states, which can be considered a real and critical bug.

Based on these points, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and improves the clarity of the warning message.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch adds the `__must_check` attribute to the declarations of `dvb_usb_generic_rw()` and `dvb_usb_generic_write()` functions in `dvb-usb.h`. This attribute indicates that the return values of these functions must be checked, as not doing so could lead to incorrect behavior in case of errors.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could cause incorrect behavior in the drivers, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces deprecated operations with their recommended counterparts. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new module option called "nested" to the kvm_intel module. This option controls whether the guest can use VMX instructions, enabling or disabling nested virtualization.

2. The patch includes proper documentation explaining the purpose and usage of the new module option.

3. The default value for the "nested" option is set to 0, meaning nested VMX is disabled by default. This ensures that the behavior of existing systems is not affected.

4. The patch introduces a new function called "nested_vmx_allowed" that checks whether a guest should be allowed to use VMX instructions and MSRs (nested VMX). This function takes into account the value of the "nested" module option and the guest's VMX cpuid bit.

5. The patch also includes a helper function called "guest_cpuid_has_vmx" that checks whether the guest's CPU supports VMX instructions.

6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to nested virtualization and does not include any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the "remain" variable from int to unsigned long in the wmi_call function of the wil6210 driver. This change is made to match the return type of the wait_for_completion_timeout function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds missing sanity checks on the version-request payload size in the gb_svc_version_request() function.
2. It checks if the payload size is less than the size of the expected request structure. If it is, an error message is printed, and the function returns -EINVAL.
3. This check ensures that the received version request payload is of the correct size, preventing potential buffer overflows or data corruption.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
5. The patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems, making it a real and critical bug fix.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "drm/nouveau/fifo/gk104.c" file of the Linux kernel. The patch aims to identify mmu engine ids for host faults and makes changes to the "gk104_fifo_fault_engine" array.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to be a functional change rather than a fix for a critical bug or issue. The modifications involve adding new entries to the "gk104_fifo_fault_engine" array, which maps engine ids to their respective names. These additions include "DISPLAY," "CAPTURE," "SCHED," "HOST0" to "HOST7," "HOSTSR," "PERF," "PTP," "MSENC," and "CE2."

While this patch may improve the functionality or accuracy of the code, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fix any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a configuration issue related to the Rockchip PCIe controller. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that the default value of the common clock configuration is incorrect, causing confusion for some EP (Endpoint) drivers. This indicates a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or functionality.

2. The patch sets the Common Clock Configuration bit in the Link Control Register to indicate that Rockchip's RC (Root Complex) is using a common clock architecture. This change aligns the configuration with the actual clock architecture being used, which is important for proper operation.

3. The patch modifies the `rockchip_pcie_init_port` function to set the RC's clock architecture as a common clock. This ensures that the correct clock configuration is applied during initialization.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a configuration issue that could potentially cause confusion and incorrect behavior for EP drivers. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the configuration and ensuring proper initialization. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the sunxi factors clock driver. The patch adds an unregister function for the factors clock, which was missing previously. This function allows for proper cleanup and prevents memory leaks when a factors clock is unregistered.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, we need to determine if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Let's go through the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch computes the `struct net` from the input device in `ip_forward` before it is used. This change ensures that the `struct net` is computed once and used consistently throughout the function.

2. The patch initializes a new variable `net` of type `struct net`.

3. The patch assigns `dev_net(skb->dev)` to the `net` variable. This assigns the network namespace associated with the input device to the `net` variable.

4. The patch replaces `dev_net(rt->dst.dev)` with `net` in the `IP_INC_STATS` macro call. This change updates the statistics counters for the network namespace associated with the input device.

5. The patch replaces `dev_net(skb_dst(skb)->dev)` with `net` in the `IP_INC_STATS_BH` macro call. This change updates the statistics counters for the network namespace associated with the input device.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real bug by ensuring that the `struct net` is computed correctly and used consistently in the `ip_forward` function. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the function `CsrUInt16ToHex` from `csr_util.c` to `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`. The function itself is not modified in any way.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve modifying the function signature of `btrfs_add_nondir` to take `struct btrfs_inode` instead of `struct inode`. This change is applied consistently in multiple places where `btrfs_add_nondir` is called.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug or issue, and it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial change. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a definition for the MAC_SM_RST register value, which represents the reset bit of the MAC status machine register.

2. In the r6040_init_mac_regs() function, the patch replaces the hardcoded value "2" with the newly defined MAC_SM_RST value when writing to the MAC_SM register. This ensures that the reset bit is correctly set.

3. Similarly, in the r6040_mac_address() function, the patch replaces the hardcoded value "2" with the MAC_SM_RST value when resetting the internal state machine.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the reset functionality of the MAC status machine in the r6040 driver. It does not involve any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as hangs or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new flag `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_1HZ` for 1 Hz resolution in the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial addition that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing redundant assignments and correcting indentation.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a necessary change to add the "dma_dir" parameter to the alloc memop in the vb2_queue structure. This change is required for a subsequent patch that needs to know the dma_dir for the dma-sg alloc memop.

The patch modifies the following files:
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-core.c
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-dma-contig.c
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-dma-sg.c
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-vmalloc.c
- include/media/videobuf2-core.h

The patch adds the "dma_dir" parameter to the __vb2_buf_mem_alloc function in videobuf2-core.c and modifies the vb2_dc_alloc, vb2_dma_sg_alloc, and vb2_vmalloc_alloc functions in their respective files to include the "dma_dir" parameter.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is necessary for the subsequent patch and does not appear to be a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds some informational print statements to the simplefb driver. The added code does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unnecessary call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The patch mentions that the IRQ is allocated with `devm_request_irq`, indicating that the IRQ is managed by the device model and does not need to be explicitly freed.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an issue that falls under the specified criteria.

In this case, the patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup change rather than addressing a critical bug. Additionally, the removal of `free_irq` is considered a trivial fix as it does not address any significant issue.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The patch correctly addresses the issue by shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect power state checks, which can cause various issues such as audio malfunctions or system instability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add variable resolution support to the gspca driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for variable resolution by allowing subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions. This indicates that the patch aims to enhance the functionality of the gspca driver.

2. The try_fmt function is called in the try_fmt_vid_cap function to pass the original resolution to the subdriver. This suggests that the patch intends to handle format modifications by the subdriver.

3. The enum_framesizes function is called in the vidioc_enum_framesizes function to retrieve the available frame sizes from the subdriver. This indicates that the patch aims to provide support for enumerating frame sizes.

4. The patch modifies the vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function to handle format modifications by the subdriver if the try_fmt function is available. Otherwise, it falls back to using the existing cam_mode.

5. The patch also modifies the vidioc_enum_framesizes function to call the enum_framesizes function if available, allowing the subdriver to provide custom frame size enumeration.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch adds important functionality to the gspca driver by introducing variable resolution support and allowing subdrivers to handle format modifications and frame size enumeration. This enhancement does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially address critical issues or improve the driver's behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or adding important functionality without containing trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __dev* attributes in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are being removed due to the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option going away. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a checkpatch.pl warning about a line being over 80 characters. The patch adds a local variable and uses it to simplify references in the rtw_createbss_cmd23a_callback() function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the `enum dio200_layout` to `enum dio200_layout_idx`. This change is not a trivial fix as it involves renaming an enum type, which can have implications for code readability and maintainability.

2. The comment in the patch states that the `enum dio200_layout` is only used once and renaming it frees up the `dio200_layout` tag for something else later. This suggests that the change is not just a cosmetic one but has a purpose in the code.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ian Abbott and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change is specific to the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c` file, which suggests that it is targeted at a specific driver and not a widespread change affecting multiple components.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It fixes a non-trivial issue, has been reviewed and approved, and is specific to a particular driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change that improves the display of vendor information for imported USB devices.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch re-initializes the rate scaling (rs) when a rate_update hook is called, which happens when a remote STA changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

2. The rs_initialize_lq function is modified to include an additional parameter, "init," which is used to determine whether to send the lq command or not.

3. The iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init function is modified to include the "init" parameter and calls rs_initialize_lq with the "init" parameter.

4. A new function, rs_rate_update, is added to handle rate updates. It stops any ongoing aggregations and calls iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init with the "init" parameter set to false.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to rate scaling and ensures that the rate scaling information is properly initialized when a rate update occurs. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, it seems to fix a potential issue that could impact the performance of the iwlwifi driver.

Considering that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to address a specific issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is always advisable to thoroughly test the patch before applying it to ensure it does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma". The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality. The patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp`) than the original `dentry`. In this case, the patch assumes that the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. The comment in the code suggests that if the dentry has been renamed, it must have been looked up and connected, so the function can exit.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It appears to fix a real issue related to dentry renaming and provides a logical and efficient solution.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the physical address information to the vm_struct for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch replaces NULL values returned by vc_vchi_audio_init(...) with error pointer values. This indicates that the patch is fixing a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve replacing NULL checks with error pointer values and modifying the return values of vc_vchi_audio_init(...).

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not seem to introduce any new bugs or regressions. The modifications are focused on handling error conditions more appropriately.

4. The patch improves error handling: By returning error pointer values instead of NULL, the patch provides more detailed information about the cause of failures, such as too many instances of audio service initialization, kzalloc failure, or vchi connections failing to open.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the identified bug and improve error handling in the bcm2835-audio staging driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be removing the unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

Since these functions are not being used, removing them does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial cleanup and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the IDs of the minor-types in the DRM subsystem. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any existing issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only involves renaming constants and does not address any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "s390/vmur: Link parent CCW device during UR device creation." It suggests specifying the parent CCW device when creating the virtual unit record (UR) device.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the code in the ur_set_online() function in the vmur.c file. It updates the device_create() function call by passing the parent CCW device as the second argument instead of NULL.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and changes, it appears that the patch aims to address a specific issue related to the creation of UR devices in the s390 architecture. By linking the parent CCW device during UR device creation, it ensures proper device hierarchy and potentially resolves any related issues.

4. Criteria for Acceptance:
   According to the criteria provided, the patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It should not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. Decision:
   Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to UR device creation in the s390 architecture. Although the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bug or issue, it appears to be a non-trivial fix that improves the code's functionality and potentially prevents future issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that the final decision may depend on additional factors and considerations, such as the feedback from other developers and maintainers.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a relatively small change that adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command. This option allows for explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. The patch also includes updates to the documentation and relevant code files.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature to the "perf record" command.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a race condition in the `dm_thin_find_block()` function of the `dm-thin-metadata.c` file. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior and can cause issues like data corruption or system instability.

2. The bug can cause an "oh, that's not good" issue: The race condition occurs when checking the `fail_io` flag outside the metadata device's `root_lock`. This can lead to incorrect behavior when the flag is being set, potentially causing unexpected failures or incorrect results.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch focuses on fixing the race condition and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by recognized contributors: The patch is signed-off by Joe Thornber and Mike Snitzer, both from Red Hat. Their signatures indicate that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the race condition and improve the stability and reliability of the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the NOHZ local_softirq_pending issue in the dp83640 driver. The patch replaces the netif_rx() function call with netif_rx_ni() to ensure it is used from process/softirq context.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch addresses a warning, which is not explicitly mentioned as a critical bug. However, warnings can sometimes indicate potential issues that could lead to more severe problems. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the warning and whether it meets the criteria for a critical bug.

Considering the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to address a potential issue, I would lean towards accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and verification, should be conducted before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the comment "Not that it's ever likely to get used" suggests that this change is not necessary or impactful.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add debug error messages to report command timeout in the liquidio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a timeout error message in the function `lio_process_ordered_list()` in the liquidio driver. This is useful for debugging and can help identify issues related to command timeouts. It does not seem to be a trivial fix.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the function `if_cfg_callback()`. This provides additional information about the failure and can aid in troubleshooting. Again, this does not appear to be a trivial fix.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses real and critical issues related to command timeouts and failure status reporting.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant use of the of_match_ptr() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming variables and converting enums into defines. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the "const" qualifier to the "of_device_id" arrays in three different files: mxc_w1.c, omap_hdq.c, and w1-gpio.c. This change makes sense because the "of_device_id" arrays are used as read-only data and should be marked as const.

2. The patch is signed-off by the author, Fabian Frederick, and also by Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is a well-known Linux kernel developer. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by knowledgeable individuals.

3. The changes made by the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve adding the "const" qualifier to improve code correctness and maintainability.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only modifies existing code to make it more robust and adhere to best practices.

Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a real issue (missing "const" qualifier) and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "drm/i915/skl: Allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP." It suggests allowing the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP.

2. Reviewed-by: The patch has been reviewed by Rodrigo Vivi <rodrigo.vivi@intel.com>. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off-by Damien Lespiau <damien.lespiau@intel.com> and Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>. This indicates that the authors have acknowledged and approved the patch.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the whitelist array in the intel_uncore.c file. Specifically, it changes the gen_bitmask value for the RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE) entry from GEN_RANGE(4, 8) to GEN_RANGE(4, 9).

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a targeted fix for the i915 driver in the DRM subsystem. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it appears to be a specific enhancement related to the reg_read ioctl and the RCS_TIMESTAMP.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `nouveau_abi16` which is a locked variant of `nouveau_abi16_get`. This new function will be used by USIF to provide limited interoperability.

2. The existing `nouveau_abi16_get` function is made static and renamed to `nouveau_abi16`. This function is responsible for retrieving the ABI16 data for a given `drm_file`.

3. The `nouveau_abi16_get` function is modified to acquire the client mutex before calling `nouveau_abi16`. This ensures proper synchronization when accessing the ABI16 data.

4. If `nouveau_abi16` returns a non-NULL value, the function returns the ABI16 data. Otherwise, it releases the client mutex and returns NULL.

5. The `nouveau_abi16_put` function is not modified in this patch.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to accessing ABI16 data in a synchronized manner. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential bug or issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the channel is set in the atusb driver. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing helper function `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to the `crypto` subsystem. This function returns the block size of an ahash algorithm.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the code in the `fib_table_lookup` function in the `net/ipv4/fib_trie.c` file.

2. The patch introduces a change in the calculation of the `mp` variable, which is used later in the code.

3. The original calculation of `mp` is `KEYLENGTH - fls(pref_mismatch)`, where `fls` is a function that finds the most significant bit set in a given value.

4. The patch replaces the `fls` function with `__fls`, which is claimed to be faster and is used when we know the argument is non-null.

5. The patch also includes a comment stating that `fls(x) = __fls(x) + 1`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch improves the performance of the code by using the `__fls` function instead of `fls` when the argument is known to be non-null. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves a significant change in the calculation of `mp`.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the missing `mutex_destroy()` function call when the driver is removed. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that when the interface is down, a mailbox command to get context statistics fails. To address this issue, the driver is restricted from issuing the get statistics command when the interface is down.

2. The patch adds a line of code that sets the "linkup" flag in the adapter's hardware structure to 0 when the interface is down. This indicates that the link status is cleared when the interface is down.

3. The patch also includes a call to netif_tx_disable() to disable transmission on the network device.

4. Finally, the patch frees the MAC list associated with the adapter.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver and ensures that the link status is cleared when the interface is down. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the driver's behavior based on the interface status.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues with the qlcnic driver when the interface is down.
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, we need to determine if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Looking at the patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and cleanup rather than fixing a critical bug or addressing a security issue. The changes involve moving code related to checking the backlog size from l2cap_core.c to l2cap_sock.c and removing the code from l2cap_core.c.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address a security issue. It appears to be a trivial cleanup rather than a fix for a real issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the function signature of `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change is made to prevent compiler errors when `CONFIG_REGULATOR` is not defined.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve deferring the building of the OSD request until just before submitting it in various callers. While this may improve code organization and readability, it does not address any specific bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the Gemini Lake platform to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake platform by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the intel_pstate_cpu_ids array.

2. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding support for a new platform, which is not considered a critical bug.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new advertising setting, "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE," which allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting. This introduces a new feature to the Bluetooth subsystem.

2. The patch modifies the "enable_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" to handle the new advertising setting. It checks if the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set and sets the "connectable" variable accordingly.

3. The "set_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" is also modified to handle the new advertising setting. It checks the value of "cp->val" and sets/clears the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag accordingly.

4. The patch includes proper error handling and parameter validation.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to introduce a new feature to the Bluetooth subsystem without any trivial fixes. It does not fix any critical bugs, but it adds functionality that could be useful for certain use cases. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch extends the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Olli Salonen and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `frequency_min` value in the `si2157_ops` structure from 110000000 to 55000000.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is extending the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. This change does not seem to fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it seems to be a simple adjustment of the frequency range. Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the '0x' notation when using the %pad format. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes forward declarations of the `struct super_block` in multiple header files. These forward declarations are not used anywhere in the codebase, and removing them does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should be considered a trivial fix and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills for the ARM64 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds missing L2 cache events for read/write accesses and misses, as well as DTLB refills. This indicates that it addresses a real and critical bug related to performance monitoring unit (PMU) events.

2. The patch has been Acked-by Will Deacon and Signed-off-by Florian Fainelli and Catalin Marinas. This suggests that it has undergone review and received approval from relevant experts in the field.

3. The changes made in the patch are specific to the ARM64 architecture, which means they are targeted and relevant to that specific platform.

4. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve adding missing cache events and refills, which can have a significant impact on performance monitoring and analysis.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills for the ARM64 architecture, and it has received approval from relevant experts.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to ext4 encryption policies. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to ensure that encryption policies can only be set on directories. This check is performed by verifying if the inode's mode is a directory (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode)). If the inode is not a directory, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid argument.

2. The check for the encryption context of the inode is performed using the ext4_inode_has_encryption_context() function. If the inode does not have an encryption context, the patch proceeds with additional checks.

3. The patch checks if the directory is empty using the ext4_empty_dir() function. If the directory is not empty, the function returns -ENOTEMPTY, indicating that the directory is not empty and cannot have an encryption policy set.

4. Finally, if all the checks pass, the patch creates an encryption context from the policy and associates it with the inode.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to ext4 encryption policies. It adds a necessary check to ensure that encryption policies can only be set on directories and performs additional checks to ensure the validity of the operation.

Considering that this patch fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "rt2x00: rt2800pci: fix AUX_CTRL register setup for RT3090/3390/3593/5592". It aims to fix the AUX_CTRL register setup for specific chipsets (RT3090, RT3390, RT3593, RT5592) in the rt2800pci driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `rt2800pci_init_registers` function in the `rt2800pci.c` file. It adds support for enabling PCIe wakeup for the mentioned chipsets by setting specific fields in the AUX_CTRL register.

3. Patch Justification:
   The patch is justified based on the fact that the `2011_1007_RT5390_RT5392_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO` driver already enables PCIe wakeup for the mentioned chipsets. The patch aims to bring the same functionality to the `rt2x00` driver.

4. Impact Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific register setup issue for the mentioned chipsets. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a specific enhancement for the `rt2x00` driver.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The change made in the patch is to fix an off-by-one error in the loop condition of the `o2cb_cluster_check()` function in the ocfs2 file system. This off-by-one error prevents a delay from occurring on the final loop iteration.

While this fix may improve the code's correctness, it does not address any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the change does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by replacing "if (foo == false)" with "if (!foo)". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `freezable_schedule_timeout_killable()` function in the PM/Freezer subsystem. The patch correctly modifies the code to return the value from `schedule_timeout_killable()` instead of `freezer_count()`. 

The patch also mentions that all current callers ignore the return code, so the bug is harmless. However, it is still considered worth fixing.

Considering the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds warnings for unresolved control methods in the ACPICA disassembler. This means that when external control methods are unresolved, the disassembler will flag it, indicating that it doesn't know how many arguments to parse for the method invocation.

2. The patch includes changes to multiple files: acglobal.h, aclocal.h, and utglobal.c.

3. In acglobal.h, the patch adds two new global variables: acpi_gbl_num_external_methods and acpi_gbl_resolved_external_methods. These variables will be used to keep track of the number of external methods and the number of resolved external methods, respectively.

4. In aclocal.h, the patch adds a new field "resolved" to the struct acpi_external_list. This field will be used to indicate whether an external method has been resolved or not.

5. In utglobal.c, the patch initializes the newly added global variables acpi_gbl_num_external_methods and acpi_gbl_resolved_external_methods to 0.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding functionality to the ACPICA disassembler to handle unresolved control methods and track the number of external methods and resolved external methods. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to Bluetooth management. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch description states that it fixes the return parameters for the Start Discovery command in Bluetooth management.

2. The patch adds a new variable "type" of type u8 to store the address type passed to the Start Discovery command.

3. In the function "mgmt_start_discovery_failed," the patch modifies the cmd_complete function call to include the "type" variable in the response message.

4. In the function "mgmt_discovering," the patch modifies the cmd_complete function call to include the "type" variable in the response message when discovering is true.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the return parameters in Bluetooth management. It does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively trivial, as they involve adding a new variable and modifying existing function calls.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug and contains trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unreachable code. The only change made is the removal of the pr_debug() statement, which is determined to never be executed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes an issue where the variable "byPacketType" is not set at all. It sets the value by calling the function "CARDbyGetPktType" and assigns it to "pDevice->byPacketType". This fix ensures that "byPacketType" is properly set.

2. The patch also changes the function "CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate" to check "basic_rates" instead of "wBasicRate". This change ensures that the correct variable is checked for the basic rates.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue and fixes it correctly. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the logic of the code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch introduces a new helper function called `sk_stream_is_writeable()` which is used to replace a hardcoded condition in several call sites. The purpose of this change is to accommodate the upcoming support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will modify the condition for TCP sockets.

The patch itself does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue related to the condition check for writeability of a socket. By introducing the helper function, the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues like hangs or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the file `fs/aio.c` and is signed-off by Al Viro, a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

2. The change is made in the function `__put_ioctx`, which is responsible for releasing resources associated with an I/O context.

3. The patch replaces the previous method of canceling the delayed work and synchronizing the work with a new method: `cancel_delayed_work_sync(&ctx->wq)`.

4. The `cancel_delayed_work_sync` function cancels a delayed work item and waits for it to complete before returning. This ensures that any pending work is properly canceled and avoids potential race conditions.

5. The previous method of canceling the work (`cancel_delayed_work` and `cancel_work_sync`) is removed from the code.

6. After canceling the delayed work, the patch continues with the remaining cleanup tasks.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a potential issue related to canceling delayed work in the `__put_ioctx` function. While the patch does not explicitly mention any specific bug or issue, it appears to be a valid improvement to the code.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the DRM/i915 driver. Additionally, there is a small refactoring for gen2 in the for_each_pipe loop. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid CamelCase naming convention.

2. Code Changes:
   - In `struct scan_attr`, the line `wilc_scan_result pfScanResult;` is changed to `wilc_scan_result result;`.
   - In the `Handle_Scan` function, the line `hif_drv->strWILC_UsrScanReq.pfUserScanResult = pstrHostIFscanAttr->pfScanResult;` is changed to `hif_drv->strWILC_UsrScanReq.pfUserScanResult = pstrHostIFscanAttr->result;`.
   - In the `host_int_scan` function, the line `msg.body.scan_info.pfScanResult = ScanResult;` is changed to `msg.body.scan_info.result = ScanResult;`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - The patch is a trivial fix that only renames a variable to avoid CamelCase naming convention.
   - The patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch switches the usage of the `iterate` field to `iterate_shared` in the `file_operations` structure for several files in different directories. This change eliminates the need to lock the directory in `dcache_dir_lseek()` and instead relies on per-struct file exclusion.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to directory locking, it can be considered a valid bug fix. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect error message in the ext4_ext_insert_index function.
2. The error message currently references "logical" and "ei_block," which is incorrect.
3. The patch updates the error message to correctly reference "eh_entries" and "eh_max."
4. The patch is signed off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, this patch addresses a real issue in the code by fixing an incorrect error message. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch issue related to spacing around the '>>' operator in the wlan-ng driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves some deallocations to the `dev_release()` function, which is part of the class device lifetime management features. This is a good practice as it promotes code reuse and simplifies the codebase.

2. The `regulator_dev_release()` function is modified to deallocate the `rdev->constraints` and release the reference to `rdev->dev.of_node` using `of_node_put()`. These deallocations are moved from `regulator_unregister()` to `regulator_dev_release()`. This change ensures that the deallocations are consistently performed when the device is released.

3. In `regulator_unregister()`, the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and the release of `rdev->dev.of_node` are removed. These deallocations are now handled in `regulator_dev_release()`. This change simplifies the `regulator_unregister()` function and avoids code duplication.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It improves code organization and promotes the use of class device lifetime management features. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue related to deallocation and resource management.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch. Further analysis may be required to consider the overall impact on the Linux kernel and potential interactions with other components.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for the of_device table in the palmas driver.

Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the rbd_header_from_disk() function in the rbd.c file.
2. The bug fix involves using sizeof (object) instead of sizeof (type) in a few places to improve readability and prevent potential overflow issues.
3. The patch introduces a local variable "size" to store the calculated sizes, which helps shorten lines and improve code readability.
4. The patch correctly checks for potential overflow before allocating memory for the header->snapc array.
5. The patch also correctly allocates memory for the header->snap_names and header->snap_sizes arrays, with proper error handling.
6. The patch fixes the allocation size for the header->object_prefix array and correctly copies the block_name from ondisk to header->object_prefix.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug and improves code readability and correctness. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a warning message in the uvesafb driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the L2CAP protocol in Bluetooth. The bug causes a disconnecting issue when the remote device sends data without having any credits to do so. This can lead to data corruption or other issues.

The patch adds a call to the "l2cap_send_disconn_req" function when there are no credits available to receive LE L2CAP data. This ensures that the appropriate L2CAP Disconnect request is sent in this situation.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and follows the L2CAP specification, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a warning related to a section mismatch in the reference from the function `pmagbbfb_probe()` to the function `pmagbbfb_erase_cursor()`. This warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization annotations.

2. The fix removes the `__init` annotation from the function `pmagbbfb_erase_cursor()`, which resolves the section mismatch warning.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Maciej W. Rozycki and Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, as it addresses a specific issue related to section mismatches.

false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "platform_device_put". It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the declaration of the `selinux_complete_init` function. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the function `nve0_ram_calc_gddr5` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/subdev/fb/ramnve0.c`.

2. The change is made in the line `nve0_ram_train(fuc, 0xbc0e0000, data);`, where the second argument is modified from `0xbc0e0000` to `0xbc0f0000`.

3. The commit message mentions that the change is made to "switch off some other random bit at some point."

4. The commit message also mentions that the change is observed when comparing "us vs nv" on a GTX660.

Based on this analysis, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose or impact of the patch. The commit message does not provide sufficient information about the bug being fixed or the reason for the change. Additionally, the change itself seems to be arbitrary, switching off a random bit without clear justification.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not appear to fix a real and critical bug or address any specific issue. It also does not seem to introduce any security fixes or address any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the "data" variable in the mpc5xxx_can_probe function const. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way a page is released in the f2fs_write_end function. The patch replaces the existing code that unlocks and releases the page with a call to f2fs_put_page.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression issue with pnfs and directio writes in the NFS module. The patch modifies the calls in the direct.c file to enable direct io to use pnfs. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a regression issue and reintroduces a capability.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros. These macros are described as "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscate the code." Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial macros, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes section conflicts in mm/percpu.c, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue in the code.

2. The patch includes changes to the declaration of the `pcpu_fc_names` array in `include/linux/percpu.h` and `mm/percpu.c`.

3. In `include/linux/percpu.h`, the patch changes the declaration of `pcpu_fc_names` from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, indicating that the array elements are constant pointers.

4. In `mm/percpu.c`, the patch changes the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata = {...};` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst = {...};`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array and also adds the `__initconst` attribute, indicating that the array is initialized during the initialization phase and remains constant afterward.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a section conflict issue and introduces const qualifiers to the `pcpu_fc_names` array. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes seem to fall under the category of "trivial" fixes, as they involve adding const qualifiers to the array declarations.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'driver' argument from the 'pxa27x_udc_stop' function in the 'pxa27x_udc.c' file. This change is made in preparation for future patches that will remove the 'driver' argument altogether.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the N-PHY radio in the b43 wireless driver.

3. The change in the patch is conditional based on the value of `dev->phy.rev`. If the revision is greater than or equal to 7, the radio register is set to `0x200` (Radio 0x2057), otherwise it is set to `0x100`. This indicates that the patch is adding support for a specific radio version.

4. The change is made in the function `b43_nphy_op_radio_read`, which is responsible for reading from the radio register.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

6. The change in the patch does not introduce any new code paths or potential issues. It simply adds support for a specific radio version.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the N-PHY radio in the b43 wireless driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any new potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the format specifier used for printing a DMA address in the ti-vpe driver. The warning suggests that the format specifier '%x' is used for an argument of type 'dma_addr_t', which is incorrect.

The patch replaces the '%x' format specifier with '%pad', which is the correct format specifier for printing a dma_addr_t type. This change ensures that the correct value is printed without any warning.

Considering the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and it only addresses a warning related to printing a DMA address, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "net/mlx5_core: Clear outbox of dealloc uar." It suggests clearing the outbox before executing the command.

2. Patch Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Majd Dibbiny, Eli Cohen, and David S. Miller.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `mlx5_cmd_free_uar` function in the `uar.c` file of the `mlx5_core` driver. It adds a line to clear the `out` structure before executing the command.

4. Analysis: The patch addresses a specific issue related to deallocating a UAR (User Access Region) in the Mellanox ConnectX-4/5 Ethernet driver. By clearing the `out` structure before executing the command, it ensures that any previous data in the structure does not interfere with the command execution.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a potential issue related to deallocating UARs and improves the reliability of the `mlx5_cmd_free_uar` function. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, causing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. In the function `iwl_mvm_bt_notif_iterator`, the condition `le32_to_cpu(data->notif->bt_activity_grading) == BT_OFF` is replaced with `!data->notif->bt_status`. This change suggests that the patch is modifying the condition for checking if BT is off. 

2. In the function `iwl_mvm_bt_rssi_event`, the condition `le32_to_cpu(mvm->last_bt_notif.bt_activity_grading) == BT_OFF` is replaced with `!mvm->last_bt_notif.bt_status`. This change suggests that the patch is modifying the condition for checking if BT is off.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is modifying the conditions for checking if BT is off in two different functions. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this change addresses a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not seem to address a critical bug or any of the mentioned issues.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a build issue in the brcmfmac driver when the CONFIG_BRCMDBG configuration option is not set. The build issue is caused by the undeclared BRCMF_FWS_TYPE_SEQ_LEN define.

The patch introduces the missing define in the source file and moves it outside the conditional part of the code, where it was originally placed under #ifdef DEBUG. Additionally, it adds a comment explaining the purpose of the define.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses a build issue when a specific configuration option is not set.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return type of the `host_int_set_mac_chnl_num` function from `s32` to `int`. The only change made is the data type of the `s32Error` variable.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the netfilter xt_hashlimit module. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new macro called XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL, which is a combination of various flag bits defined in the enum. This macro is used to validate if the set bits are within a valid range.

2. In the hashlimit_mt_check function, the patch replaces the check for XT_HASHLIMIT_MAX with a check using the XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL macro. This change ensures that only the valid flag bits are allowed in the mode field of the hashlimit_cfg structure.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue by introducing a more robust validation mechanism for the mode field in the hashlimit_cfg structure. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new macro and modifies the existing code logic.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `addrconf_rs_timer` function in the `net/ipv6/addrconf.c` file.

2. The patch adds a new variable `dev` of type `struct net_device *` and assigns it the value of `idev->dev`.

3. The patch releases the write lock on `idev->lock` by calling `write_unlock(&idev->lock)`.

4. The patch then checks if it can retrieve the link-local address (`lladdr`) using the `ipv6_get_lladdr` function. If successful, it calls `ndisc_send_rs` with the retrieved link-local address and the `in6addr_linklocal_allrouters` address.

5. If the link-local address cannot be retrieved, the patch jumps to the `put` label, which releases the reference to `idev` by calling `in6_dev_put(idev)`.

6. Finally, the patch reacquires the write lock on `idev->lock` and updates the RS timer if necessary.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential deadlock issue caused by calling `ndisc_send_rs` with the write lock held. The patch releases the write lock before calling `ndisc_send_rs` and reacquires it afterward. This ensures that the lock is not held during the potentially blocking `ndisc_send_rs` call, preventing a deadlock.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential deadlock issue, it can be classified as fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve switching the function `drbd_may_finish_epoch()` from using `mdev` to `tconn` as an argument. This change does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new constant `PT_MAX_HUGEPAGE_LEVEL` in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h` and modifies several functions in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c` to use this new constant. 

The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a code refactoring or optimization change rather than a bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a processor identifier for the M5150 processor in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial addition to the code without any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the xgene GPIO driver. The patch modifies the driver to use the gpiochip data pointer instead of relying on container_of() to store a pointer to the state container.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it addresses a real issue in the driver, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the display of the "tx_priority_pauseframes" statistic in the ethtool stats for the be2net driver.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `uart_usp_ff_empty_mask` function in the `sirfsoc_uart.h` file.

2. The change is made to the `empty_bit` calculation, specifically the line `empty_bit = ilog2(port->fifosize) + 1;`.

3. The original code calculates `empty_bit` as the base-2 logarithm of `port->fifosize`, while the modified code adds 1 to the result.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug, nor does it fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The change seems to be a minor adjustment to the calculation of `empty_bit`, which does not fall under the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes undesired spaces, lines, and tabs. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current ECAM kernel implementation uses ioremap() to map the ECAM configuration space memory region, which can create ordering issues for software due to posted write transactions on the CPU host bus being non-posted in the PCI express fabric. This issue can potentially lead to data corruption or other problems.

2. The patch proposes a solution: It updates the ioremap() interface to use pci_remap_cfgspace(), which guarantees that non-posted write transactions are issued for memory writes within the ECAM memory mapped address region. This change ensures proper ordering and avoids potential issues.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. Instead, it addresses a significant issue related to memory mapping and transaction ordering.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers: It has been reviewed and signed-off by Lorenzo Pieralisi and Bjorn Helgaas, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny and testing.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a critical bug, proposes a suitable solution, and does not contain trivial changes. Therefore, the recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the message output of the mtd_nandecctest driver. The changes include using pr_* instead of printk, printing a hexdump of ECC code if the test fails, changing the log level for the hexdump of data, and factoring out the hexdump code into a separate function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization for the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism to improve the average lookup time for memslots.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug, it does address an optimization issue that can improve performance in certain workloads. However, it does not fall under the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a return value to the function `kvmppc_core_check_requests` in the PowerPC architecture of the KVM module. The function previously had a void return type and has been changed to int.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for vendor commands and events testing in the mac80211_hwsim driver.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to symbol versioning.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Intel graphics driver (i915) in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds code to update the pipe size and adjust the fitter if needed.
2. It checks if the "i915_fastboot" parameter is set.
3. If the parameter is set and the current pipe has an LVDS or eDP output, it performs additional operations to turn off panel fitting.
4. The operations involve writing specific values to certain registers related to panel fitting.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to panel fitting in the Intel graphics driver. However, it does not explicitly mention any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would classify this patch as a potential "NAK" (should not be accepted) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, further information about the specific bug or issue being addressed would be necessary to make a more accurate determination.

false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "staging: rtl8192e: rtl8192e: rtl_core.c: Audit the return value of register_netdev()". This suggests that it aims to improve the error handling in the rtl8192e driver's probe routine.

2. The patch inspects the return value of the register_netdev() function call in the driver probe routine.

3. If the return value of register_netdev() is non-zero (indicating an error), the patch adds a goto statement to jump to the err_free_irq label.

4. The err_free_irq label is not shown in the provided patch, but it suggests that it handles the cleanup and freeing of resources in case of an error during device registration.

5. The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential error handling issue in the rtl8192e driver's probe routine by properly handling the return value of register_netdev(). This can help prevent potential issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption that may occur due to improper error handling.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces two helper functions for accessing the ITS BASERn register. These functions, its_read_baser() and its_write_baser(), provide a convenient way to read and write the BASERn register.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. It is more of an enhancement or code refactoring rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel crash caused by a bogus dereference when the `app_id` is zero. This can be considered a critical bug that could lead to system instability or crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward export of two functions, bdi_alloc_node() and bdi_put(), which are used by MTD (Memory Technology Devices) and need to be called directly. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes the `q->bufs[vb->index]` variable correctly before calling `buf_init()`. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to resource release in the `mg_get_local_EKB` and `mg_get_ICV` functions in the `ms.c` file of the `rts5208` staging driver. The patch adds a jump to the appropriate label to ensure that resources are properly released before returning.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a resource release issue, which is not explicitly mentioned as a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes trailing commas in enum declarations. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to mark the actual interrupt source for some interrupts currently marked as reserved in the ARM mx53 platform.

2. Impact: This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to address an issue related to interrupt handling.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the interrupt definitions in the mx53.h header file. It replaces the reserved interrupt numbers with the actual interrupt sources.

4. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a non-critical change related to interrupt handling.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only updates the version number in the dm-ioctl.h header file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue reported by Smatch, which complains about a cast to "int" in the min_t() macro potentially causing incorrect values to be returned. This indicates that there is a bug that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch removes the "const" qualifier, which suggests that it was unnecessary in this context. Removing unnecessary code can improve code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch modifies the current_read_size variable assignment in the cifs_read() function. It replaces the min_t() cast from "const int" to "uint" (unsigned int). This change ensures that very large values of current_read_size are not converted to negative values, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. The patch also includes a comment explaining the reason for the change. This helps in understanding the intention behind the code modification.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause incorrect values to be returned. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds loopback mode support to the spi-imx driver. Loopback mode can be activated by setting the LBC (LoopBack Control) bit of the ECSPI_TESTREG register.

2. The patch defines the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG and MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC constants to be used in the code.

3. In the mx51_ecspi_config function, the patch adds code to read the current value of the ECSPI_TESTREG register and modify it based on the SPI_LOOP flag in the configuration. If SPI_LOOP is set, the LBC bit is set in the register; otherwise, it is cleared.

4. Finally, in the spi_imx_probe function, the patch adds the SPI_LOOP flag to the mode_bits field of the spi_imx->bitbang.master structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds support for loopback mode in the spi-imx driver. Loopback mode can be useful for testing and debugging purposes. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and consolidation rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the multi-device fixup code from the `denali_init()` function to a new helper function called `denali_multidev_fixup()`. 

While code refactoring can improve code readability and maintainability, it does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical change and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the openvswitch module in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to use the flow hash during the flow lookup operation to detect hash collisions and avoid unnecessary flow key comparisons.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new capability to the microblaze architecture, allowing a device tree source (DTS) author to flag a specific timer as the system timer.
2. If the chosen node in the device tree contains a "system-timer=<&foo>" entry, the handle specified in the entry will be used as the system timer.
3. If no such entry exists, the patch falls back to the current behavior of using the first found timer as the system timer.
4. The patch includes proper error handling. If the chosen timer node is not found, it prints an informative message and continues using the default behavior.
5. The patch ensures that a valid timer node is obtained before proceeding, using the "of_find_compatible_node" function.
6. The patch also retrieves the timer's base address using the "of_get_property" function.

Overall, this patch introduces a useful feature for the microblaze architecture without introducing any trivial changes. It addresses a potential issue related to system timer selection, which can have a significant impact on system behavior. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock.

2. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_data`, the patch adds a check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the patch sets the `TR_TOUCHED` flag and skips taking the `gfs2_log_lock`. This change helps avoid unnecessary contention on the `gfs2_log_lock`.

3. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_meta`, the patch adds a similar check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the patch sets the `TR_TOUCHED` flag and skips taking the `gfs2_log_lock`. Again, this change reduces contention on the `gfs2_log_lock`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue of contention on the `gfs2_log_lock` and improves performance by avoiding unnecessary locking. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for Intel Skylake. The patch adds support for DMA resume capability to resume the DMA position when a stream is suspended or resumed.

Analyzing the patch, it seems to address a specific issue related to resuming the DMA position after a stream is suspended. It enables the DMA Resume enable bit for the stream and sets the dpib and lpib positions to resume before starting the DMA. Additionally, it saves the dpib and lpib positions when the stream is suspended.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an enhancement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug: The patch fixes a bug related to the default value for available voltages in the mxcmmc driver. If available voltages are not given, the driver doesn't set a value for the ocr_avail mask.

2. The bug can cause issues: Not setting a default value for the ocr_avail mask can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results when accessing the MMC interface.

3. The fix is non-trivial: The patch modifies the code to ensure that a default value is set for the ocr_avail mask when it is not provided. It also takes into account the comment in the platform_data/mmc-mxcmmc.h file, assuming MMC_VDD_32_33 | MMC_VDD_33_34 as the default value.

4. The patch has been reviewed: The patch has been reviewed by Sascha Hauer and signed-off by Matteo Facchinetti and Ulf Hansson, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies a NULL comparison. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, falling under the category of spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc., which are not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding SERDES initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 in the ath9k driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 SERDES in the ath9k driver. This indicates that it is addressing a specific hardware configuration.

2. The patch modifies the `ar9003_hw_init_mode_regs` function in `ar9003_hw.c` to include the new initialization values for the SERDES.

3. It also adds a new array `ar9462_2p1_pciephy_clkreq_disable_L1` in `ar9462_2p1_initvals.h` to store the SERDES initialization values.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 SERDES in the ath9k driver. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a critical bug or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the Linux kernel maintainers or the relevant subsystem maintainers to determine if this patch meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the i40e_nvm.c file in the i40e driver for Intel Ethernet devices.

2. The patch adds additional debug information to the i40e_acquire_nvm function.

3. The patch changes the behavior of polling on the NVM semaphore. Previously, the code would always poll on the semaphore if there was a previous reservation error. With the patch, it will only poll if there is time left on the previous reservation.

4. The patch also adds debug messages to provide more information about the NVM acquisition failure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the behavior of the i40e driver by optimizing the polling on the NVM semaphore and providing additional debug information. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   - The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch modifies the data type of a field, which is not considered a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The watchdog ping return errors were being ignored by the watchdog core, which could lead to potential hardware errors or issues with the underlying device driver.

2. The patch propagates the ping error code to the user space, ensuring that the watchdog daemon is informed about any possible hardware error or unregistered device driver.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and reviewers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant parties.

4. The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They involve adding error handling code to properly handle the return value of the watchdog_ping function.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue and introduces necessary error handling, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to setting the number of queues correctly in the NVMe driver. The patch modifies the `nvme_get_features` function to instead call `nvme_set_features` when setting the number of queues.

The change seems to address a potential bug where the number of queues is incorrectly set using the `nvme_get_features` function instead of the appropriate `nvme_set_features` function. This could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the NVMe driver.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior or instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that marks certain functions as static in the `tfc_conf.c` file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only eliminates warnings related to missing prototypes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds two clocks for the mxc rtc driver on imx35, which seems to be a straightforward addition without fixing any specific issue.

Since this patch addresses an error handling issue, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves cleaning up the usage of the `hcpriv` field in the `octeon-usb` staging driver. The changes involve using `ep->hcpriv` for the pipe handle and `urb->hcpriv` for the submit handle, instead of packing both into the same field.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the AMD IOMMU driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the function `dma_ops_free_addresses` in the `amd_iommu.c` file.

2. The patch replaces the previous logic of setting `dom->need_flush` with a direct flush of the IOMMU TLB.

3. The condition `if (address + pages > range->next_bit)` checks if the address plus the number of pages exceeds the next bit in the range.

4. If the condition is true, the patch calls `domain_flush_tlb` and `domain_flush_complete` to flush the IOMMU TLB.

5. Finally, the patch performs some address calculations.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to flushing the IOMMU TLB in the AMD IOMMU driver. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation and testing of the patch to ensure it fixes a real and critical bug, and that it does not contain any trivial changes. Once the bug and its impact are better understood, a decision can be made whether to include it in a stable release or not.

3. The patch validates the value of the "level" variable after the conversion. It checks if the value is within the acceptable range (0 to 3) and returns -EINVAL if it is not. This ensures that only valid values are accepted.

4. Similarly, the patch validates the value of the "reset" variable after the conversion. It checks if the value is equal to 1 and returns -EINVAL if it is not. This ensures that only the accepted value is allowed.

5. The patch performs the necessary actions based on the validated values of "level" and "reset". It calls the appropriate functions to set the sensor level or reset the protection interface.

Overall, the patch fixes potential issues related to input validation and improves the robustness of the code. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical bug. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing platform_set_drvdata call in the da9052_bat_probe function. This fix ensures that platform_get_drvdata in da9052_bat_remove does not return NULL.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization order of the hardware (HW) so that the interrupt is only requested after the HW is initialized. This can help prevent potential issues that may arise from requesting the interrupt before the HW is fully initialized. This change seems reasonable and can potentially address certain bugs or issues.

2. The patch replaces the use of `irq_of_parse_and_map` with `platform_get_irq`. This change suggests a switch to a more appropriate and recommended function for obtaining the interrupt number. It is generally beneficial to use the recommended functions provided by the kernel, as they are more likely to be maintained and updated.

3. The patch includes a reset of the SPI-HW block after the interrupt is obtained. This ensures that the SPI-HW block is in a known state before further operations are performed. This can help prevent potential issues caused by uninitialized or inconsistent states.

4. The patch requests the interrupt using `devm_request_irq`. This function is used to request an interrupt and associate it with a specific interrupt handler. It is a standard and recommended way to handle interrupts in the kernel.

5. Finally, the patch registers the SPI master using `devm_spi_register_master`. This function registers the SPI master with the kernel, allowing it to be recognized and utilized by other components. This step is necessary for proper SPI functionality.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to address the initialization order, interrupt handling, and SPI-HW reset in a logical and appropriate manner. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization and cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch converts the usage of `wait_for(I915_READ(reg))` to `intel_wait_for_register()` in the `assert_chv_phy_status()` function.

Although the patch claims to improve efficiency and reduce code bloat, it does not address any specific issue such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the patch does not fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the bnx2x device encountering parity errors and not DMAing any replies. The patch adds a timeout for ramrod replies using the `wait_event_timeout()` function, allowing for forward progress and chip reset.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: Yes, it addresses the issue of the bnx2x device not DMAing replies when encountering parity errors.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description, but the issue of not DMAing replies can potentially lead to data corruption or other undesirable consequences.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current code ignores the failure of devm_clk_get for the core clock and explicitly sets it to NULL. This can lead to issues when querying other remaining clocks.

2. The patch fixes the bug by returning the failure when devm_clk_get fails for the core clock. This ensures that the failure is properly handled and prevents potential issues caused by a NULL core clock.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific bug.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple developers, as indicated by the Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by tags.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix a response issue in the drm/dp/mst module. Currently, the module replies with NACK (negative acknowledgment) to UP (update) requests, which may confuse receivers. The patch suggests changing the reply type to ACK (acknowledgment) to respond correctly.

2. Bug Severity: Although the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bug or issue, it addresses a potential confusion caused by the incorrect reply type. While no actual issues have been reported, it is still important to respond to UP requests correctly.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the reply type from 1 (NACK) to 0 (ACK) in the drm_dp_encode_up_ack_reply function. This change ensures that the module responds with the correct acknowledgment type.

4. Patch Size: The patch is small and focused, making only the necessary changes to fix the issue. It does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to memory allocation failure in the hpsa_get_device_id function in the hpsa.c file. The patch changes the return value from -1 to -ENOMEM when kzalloc fails to allocate memory.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does fix a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues if memory allocation fails. Additionally, the fix does not seem to be trivial, as it involves changing the return value and handling of memory allocation failure.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" on the s390 architecture.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds additional information to the /proc/cpuinfo file.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of adding new features or enhancements rather than addressing a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "lpfc: Fix setting of EQ (interrupt) delay Multiplier". It suggests a fix for an issue related to the configuration of the EQ delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing in the lpfc driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup() function in the lpfc_init.c file. It adds a loop to configure the EQ delay multiplier for all EQs created using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function. Additionally, it modifies the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function in the lpfc_sli.c file to accept a uint32_t parameter instead of a uint16_t parameter.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. The patch appears to address a configuration issue related to interrupt coalescing, but it does not explicitly mention any specific bug or issue that it resolves. Without further context or information, it is not possible to determine the severity or impact of the issue being addressed.

4. Recommendation:
   Given the lack of specific information about the bug being fixed and its impact, it is not possible to make an informed decision about whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and clarification from the patch author or relevant stakeholders to determine the severity and criticality of the bug being addressed.

Based on the available information, I would classify this patch as "Not Applicable" (NAK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases until further clarification is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a helper function addition in the tcp_input.c file. The purpose of this helper function is to prepare for the main RACK patch. 

However, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a code improvement or preparation for a future patch rather than addressing an existing issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capabilities and structures for SR-IOV E-Switch in the mlx5 driver. However, the patch does not address any specific bug or issue that falls under the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes timeout issues in the qat_hal_check_ae_alive() function, qat_hal_init_esram() function, and qat_hal_clear_gpr() function. These issues can potentially cause hangs or failures in the QAT (QuickAssist Technology) subsystem.

2. The patch changes the data type of the "times" variable from unsigned int to int. This change is necessary because the value of "times" should be -1 after the loop, and using an unsigned int would not allow for this condition to be checked correctly.

3. The patch updates the timeout condition in the loops. Instead of checking if "times" is equal to zero, it now checks if "times" is less than zero. This change ensures that the loop exits when the timeout is reached.

4. The patch includes proper error handling and logging when the timeout is reached. It prints an error message and returns an appropriate error code (-EFAULT or -EINVAL) to indicate the failure.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real and critical issue related to timeouts in the QAT subsystem.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause hangs and failures in the QAT subsystem. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes a typo in the comment, it does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that added a "drv_priv" pointer for driver use in the mac80211 subsystem. The reason for the revert is that no driver has been found to need this functionality, and the desired functionality has been implemented in a different way.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of a cleanup or removal of unnecessary code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "const" keyword from the SOC_ENUM_SINGLE_DECL macro. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds dma_memcopy support to bcm2835-dma, which suggests that it addresses a real and critical bug related to data copying.

2. The patch includes a check for an error condition in bcm2835_dma_create_cb_chain, indicating that it fixes a specific issue that was encountered during the development of this patch.

3. The patch has been tested using dmatest for all enabled channels, which indicates that it has undergone testing to ensure its effectiveness.

4. The patch includes a new function, bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy, which prepares a DMA transfer for memory-to-memory copying. This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to DMA memory copying.

5. The patch updates the dma_cap_set to include DMA_MEMCPY, indicating that it adds support for memory-to-memory DMA transfers.

6. The patch updates the od->ddev.directions to include BIT(DMA_MEM_TO_MEM), indicating that it enables memory-to-memory DMA transfers.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to DMA memory copying and adds necessary support for memory-to-memory DMA transfers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to a potentially uninitialized variable in the bcm2835_clock_choose_div_and_prate() function of the bcm2835 clock driver. 

Since this patch addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new event buffer cache in the DWC3 USB driver. The purpose of this cache is to copy triggered events from the event buffer and process them later in the bottom half handler. The patch also includes memory allocation for the cache.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue. 

From the patch description, it mentions that the buffer cache is needed to implement a workaround for a known erratum in recent DWC3 releases. This suggests that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the DWC3 USB driver.

Considering this information, it is likely that the patch is fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue. Therefore, my analysis is that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time. This change allows the MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI flag to be added to the msi_domain_info structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be an enhancement or feature addition.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. This indicates that the patch addresses a power-saving issue, which can be considered important.

2. The patch mentions that AFTR mode support has already been implemented for other Exynos SoCs for a few years. This suggests that the patch is adding support for a feature that has been successfully implemented and tested on other similar SoCs.

3. The differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC compared to Exynos4x12 SoCs are listed, including the use of different secure firmware calls, wakeup masks, and the need to set/clear a specific boot mode flag. These differences indicate that the patch is addressing specific hardware variations and ensuring proper functionality on the Exynos3250 SoC.

4. The patch includes changes in the firmware.c, pm.c, regs-pmu.h, and smc.h files, which are relevant to power management and hardware-specific configurations. These changes suggest that the patch is addressing low-level system functionality.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a real and critical issue related to power management on the Exynos3250 SoC. It introduces support for AFTR mode, which is important for reducing energy consumption and enabling more advanced power-saving modes. The patch also takes into account hardware-specific differences and modifies relevant files related to power management.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue and meets the criteria for inclusion in the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error in the `arch/mips/ath79/mach-ap136.c` file. The error is caused by passing too many arguments to the `ap136_pci_init` function. The patch modifies the function declaration to include the expected argument, which is a `u8` pointer.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem. Additionally, the fix seems to be trivial, as it only involves adding a missing function argument. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the backlight driver for the lp8788 chip. The patch explicitly applies PWM configuration extracted from pwm_args and calls pwm_apply_args() after requesting the PWM device. 

However, the patch also includes a comment stating that pwm_apply_args() should be removed when switching to the atomic PWM API. This suggests that the current implementation is not ideal and will be replaced in the future.

Given the information provided, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any real issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be more of an intermediate state fix and not a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the FSI DMAEngine in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the DMA is properly terminated at the start/stop time, which prevents noise on playback. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause audio playback issues. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reclaim reboot state when the clientid is stale in NFSv4.0.
2. It adds the functionality to set NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED and reclaim reboot state for all v4.0 errors and recoverable errors on EXCHANGE_ID for v4.1.
3. It clears the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM bit and breaks the switch case for lease confirmation errors.
4. It clears the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM bit and calls the functions nfs4_state_clear_reclaim_reboot() and nfs4_state_start_reclaim_reboot() for stale clientid errors.
5. It handles the NFS4ERR_CLID_INUSE error by printing an error message.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to stale clientid in NFSv4.0. It introduces necessary changes to reclaim reboot state and handle various error conditions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is attempting to fix a section mismatch issue in the ie6xx_wdt_probe() function in the ie6xx_wdt.c file. The patch removes the __devexit annotation from the ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit() function, which is called as part of the error cleanup path in ie6xx_wdt_probe().

However, it seems that the patch is introducing a duplicate definition of the ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit() function. The function is defined twice, once with __devexit annotation and once without it. This is likely a mistake or oversight in the patch.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it introduces a duplicate function definition, which could potentially cause issues and is not a critical bug fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `of_node_put` function call to decrement the reference count. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the `rapl_ids` array as `__initconst`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple optimization to release memory after initialization is done.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the "pending" flag in the command structure. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `set_page_private` and `page_private` with `set_freepage_migratetype` and `get_freepage_migratetype` respectively. This change aims to make the code clearer.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it is a trivial fix without any significant impact, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unused "debug" module parameter from the cypress_m8.c USB serial driver. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability by using defined macros instead of hard-coding values. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing break statements in the `ath5k_hw_set_spur_mitigation_filter` function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code style cleanup in the rt2800lib.c file of the rt2x00 driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only involves whitespace changes and code formatting improvements, which are considered trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointless copy operation. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and not suitable for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused variables and corresponding lines. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). This is because it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch contains only trivial changes such as removing unused variables and lines, which are not considered critical fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function. This change is justified because the argument is guaranteed to always be the current CPU. Removing the argument simplifies the code and improves readability.

2. The patch replaces per_cpu_ptr() with this_cpu_ptr(). This change is also justified because this_cpu_ptr() is the appropriate macro to use when accessing per-CPU variables in the current CPU context.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only improves the existing code by removing unnecessary arguments and using the appropriate macros.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the codebase without introducing any risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the logging mechanism for link up/down messages in the ixgbevf driver. The patch replaces the use of `hw_dbg` with `dev_info` to log the messages.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the mx51_clocks_init() function to a device tree (DT) call. This change is specific to the i.MX51 platform, which is becoming a DT-only platform. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devinitdata. This indicates that it is related to the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option, which is going away. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and it is a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply replaces the call to `platform_get_drvdata(pdev)` with the already available `dw` variable. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding clock definitions for the SYS-DMAC modules in the r8a7796 SoC. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch introduces two new functions, `vm_entry_controls_reset_shadow` and `vm_exit_controls_reset_shadow`, which simply read the entry/exit control fields of the VMCS and store them in the respective shadow variables.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that cleans up the declaration of `ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work` in `ieee80211_i.h`. The patch removes the duplicate declaration of `ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work` and moves it to the correct location.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable from "pvRecvBuffer" to "recv_buf" in the wilc_mq_recv function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a feature enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. The patch adds support for host-protection-interruption in the s390 architecture for KVM. 

Since the patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the key initialization of tcp_fastopen cookies to use net_get_random_once instead of get_random_bytes. This change ensures that if the user sets a custom key, net_get_random_once is called at least once to avoid overwriting the user-provided key when the first cookie is generated later on.

2. The patch adds a new function tcp_fastopen_init_key_once, which generates a dummy secret key but does not publish it. This is done to prevent regenerating a new key on the first invocation of tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen.

3. In the proc_tcp_fastopen_key function, tcp_fastopen_init_key_once is called with the argument "false" to generate a dummy secret key without publishing it. This ensures that a new key is not regenerated on the first invocation of tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen.

4. In the tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen function, tcp_fastopen_init_key_once is called with the argument "true" to generate a new key and publish it. This ensures that a valid key is available for cookie generation.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a non-critical change related to key initialization for tcp_fastopen cookies.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch primarily replaces the usage of `serial->private` with `usb_get_serial_data(serial)` and `usb_set_serial_data(serial, data)`.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves a trivial change, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode for the omap-dma driver. This is a functional enhancement that can be beneficial for certain use cases.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes to the omap_chan structure to track the paused state of the DMA channel.

3. The omap_dma_terminate_all() function has been modified to avoid stopping the DMA twice if it is already paused. This ensures correct behavior and avoids unnecessary operations.

4. The omap_dma_pause() and omap_dma_resume() functions have been implemented to handle the pause/resume functionality. They check if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode before allowing the pause/resume operation. If not in cyclic mode, an error is returned.

5. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by, Acked-by, and Tested-by tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Overall, this patch adds a useful feature to the omap-dma driver without introducing any trivial changes. It addresses a real issue and does not appear to have any negative impact. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential buffer overflow issue in the mei_cl_device_match() function in the drivers/misc/mei/bus.c file.

2. The patch replaces the use of strncpy() with strncmp() for string comparison. This change ensures that the final null terminator is not omitted during the comparison.

3. The patch also replaces the use of strncpy() with sizeof() for copying the device name into the id.name buffer. This change ensures that the entire buffer is properly filled and avoids potential buffer overflows.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

5. The patch has been signed-off by Tomas Winkler <tomas.winkler@intel.com> and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>, indicating that the authors take responsibility for the changes.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential buffer overflow issue and improves the safety and correctness of the code. It meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it addresses a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - disable RRC by default." It suggests disabling the RRC (Radio Resource Control) feature by default in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices.

2. The patch checks if the firmware advertises support for the BT Coex RRC feature. If the firmware supports it, the feature is enabled; otherwise, it remains disabled.

3. The patch modifies the "enum iwl_ucode_tlv_capa" enumeration in the iwl-fw-file.h header file to include a new capability flag, "IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_BT_COEX_RRC," indicating support for BT Coex RRC.

4. The patch updates the "iwl_send_bt_init_conf_old" function in the coex_legacy.c file to use the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function to check if BT Coex RRC is supported by the firmware. If supported, the BT_COEX_RRC flag is set in the bt_cmd->flags field.

5. The patch adds the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function to the mvm.h header file. This function checks if the BT Coex RRC capability flag is set in the firmware's ucode_capa structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch modifies the behavior of the iwlwifi driver by disabling the BT Coex RRC feature by default unless the firmware explicitly supports it. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, causing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the blk-mq subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch correctly frees the hctx->ctx_map inside the blk_mq_free_queue() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that can potentially cause resource leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding JPEG register definitions for the CODA7541 media platform driver. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding new register definitions for the driver, which can be considered a trivial change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Lustre staging driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch updates the function signature of the `lnet_ping` function in the `lnet/api-ni.c` file. It changes the type of the `ids` parameter from `lnet_process_id_t *` to `lnet_process_id_t __user *`. This change indicates that the `ids` parameter is a pointer to user space memory.

2. The `lnet_ping` function is called in the `LNetCtl` function, passing the `data->ioc_pbuf1` parameter as the `ids` argument. This change ensures that the correct type is passed to `lnet_ping` and avoids any potential issues with accessing user space memory.

3. The patch also updates the function signature of the `lnet_ping` function in the `lnet/api-ni.c` file. It changes the type of the `ids` parameter from `lnet_process_id_t *` to `lnet_process_id_t __user *`. This change ensures that the correct type is used when accessing the `ids` parameter within the `lnet_ping` function.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a potential issue with accessing user space memory correctly in the Lustre staging driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves changing the type of a parameter and updating the function signature. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver. The patch adds two new event handlers, `wmi_evt_linkup` and `wmi_evt_linkdown`, which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively. 

The `wmi_evt_linkup` function turns on the network device carrier, indicating that the link is up for a specific CID (Connection ID). On the other hand, the `wmi_evt_linkdown` function turns off the network device carrier, indicating that the link is down for a specific CID and provides a reason for the link down event.

Based on the information provided, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding functionality to handle linkup/linkdown events in the driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a fix for a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the `ieee80211_ibss_join()` function in the `ibss.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch adds a missing unlock operation on an error path.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a minor fix related to locking.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that constifies the `def_qos_parameters` structure in the `rtl8192u` driver. The patch adds the `const` qualifier to the structure declaration, indicating that the fields of the structure are not modified.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and it addresses a real issue by making the `def_qos_parameters` structure constant, it can be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a naming collision issue of the variable "nr_irqs" in two different files: irq.c and prm_common.c. The warning message from sparse indicates that the symbol "nr_irqs" is shadowing an earlier one.

2. The patch renames the local variable "nr_irqs" to "nr_irq" in both files to resolve the naming collision.

3. The change in irq.c replaces the usage of "nr_irqs" with "nr_irq" in the function omap_intc_of_init(). This ensures that the correct variable is used when initializing the IRQ.

4. The change in prm_common.c replaces the usage of "nr_irqs" with "nr_irq" in the function omap_prcm_irq_handler(). This ensures that the correct variable is used when handling interrupts.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, the patch fixes a real issue (naming collision) and does not introduce any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing forward declarations of structures in cpuidle.h. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any substantial changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a memory leak issue when handling device tree (dt) maps in the MediaTek pinctrl driver.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers.

3. The patch modifies the function `mtk_pctrl_dt_subnode_to_map` in the `pinctrl-mtk-common.c` file.

4. The patch adds a check for the return value of `pinconf_generic_parse_dt_config` and returns the error if it occurs. This ensures that any error during parsing the device tree configuration is properly handled.

5. The patch checks if `num_pins` or `maps_per_pin` is zero and returns `-EINVAL` if either condition is true. This ensures that the number of pins and maps per pin are valid and prevents further execution if they are not.

6. The patch calculates the `reserve` value based on the number of pins and maps per pin.

7. The patch calls `pinctrl_utils_reserve_map` to reserve the required number of maps. If the function returns an error, the patch jumps to the `exit` label and frees the allocated `configs` before returning the error.

8. The patch iterates over each pin and performs various operations, such as reading the pinmux property, finding the corresponding pin group, and mapping the pin to a function.

9. The patch checks if `has_config` is true and calls `pinctrl_utils_add_map_configs` to add map configurations for the pin group. If the function returns an error, the patch jumps to the `exit` label and frees the allocated `configs` before returning the error.

10. Finally, the patch returns 0 if all operations are successful.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug related to memory leaks and handles various error conditions properly. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the gpio-ml-ioh driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the `ioh_gpio_get` function in the `gpio-ml-ioh.c` file.
2. The original implementation returns the value of `ioread32(&chip->reg->regs[chip->ch].pi) & (1 << nr)`.
3. The patch modifies the return statement to `return !!(ioread32(&chip->reg->regs[chip->ch].pi) & (1 << nr))`.
4. The change is introduced to ensure that the return value is clamped to [0,1] by using the `ret = !!(val)` design pattern.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves code readability by using the `ret = !!(val)` design pattern.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding entries in the HID table and referencing the "bytcht_da7213" driver in the ASoC Intel Atom machine driver. 

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the socket argument in the function `tcp_create_openreq_child()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or address any existing issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the code in drivers/acpi/osl.c.
2. It adds a seemingly useless check that is necessary to avoid false positive lockdep complaints.
3. The code related to the check is rearranged to make fewer checks.
4. The patch also changes the allocation function from kmalloc to kzalloc, which initializes the allocated memory to zero.
5. It introduces comments to explain the purpose of the code and its relation to lockdep complaints.
6. It uses INIT_WORK() to ensure different static lockdep keys for each workqueue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to address a lockdep complaint and improve code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the initialization of the 'status' variable into the error handling code in the rsi_send_data_pkt() function. This change improves the logical flow of the code.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or feature changes. It only modifies the variable initialization location.

4. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an issue that can be categorized as an "oh, that's not good" issue. By moving the variable initialization to the error handling code, the code becomes more readable and maintainable.

Considering the above points, the patch does not introduce any risks or regressions and improves the code quality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a platform device registration for the HDMI audio codec on OMAP4 Pandaboard and PandaboardES boards. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. 

In this case, the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it fixes. It seems to be adding support for transmitting audio through the HDMI output on the mentioned boards. While this may be a useful feature, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ath6kl: configure SDIO when power is reapplied." It suggests that when power is removed from the device, the SDIO settings return to default, and this patch aims to fix that by reconfiguring after power is reapplied.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The patch adds a new function called "ath6kl_sdio_config" which is responsible for configuring the SDIO settings.

4. The "ath6kl_sdio_power_on" function is modified to call the "ath6kl_sdio_config" function after a delay of 10 milliseconds.

5. If the "ath6kl_sdio_config" function fails to configure the SDIO, an error message is printed, and the function returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to SDIO configuration after power is reapplied. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new function and modifies an existing one. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue being fixed.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real issue related to SDIO configuration after power is reapplied. However, a more thorough analysis and testing should be conducted to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a condition that is reported as impossible. The patch removes a test for an impossible condition where `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. However, the patch does not address the condition where `tid` is greater than 255, which is the maximum value for a `uint8` variable.

Considering the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather removes a test for an impossible condition, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs. The patch adds compatibility checks for several R-Car SoC models, including r8a7792, r8a7793, and r8a7794. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug, causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Since the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it fixes a real and critical problem. However, enabling PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs can be considered an improvement or enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value from 0 to NULL in the function `host1x_bo_lookup()` in the `gr2d.c` file of the `drm/tegra` driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "HID: wiimote: replace hid_output_raw_report with hid_hw_output_report for output requests." This suggests that it aims to replace a specific function call with another function call for output requests in the HID wiimote driver.

2. The patch provides an explanation that the new function call, hid_hw_output_report, is equivalent to the old function call, hid_output_raw_report, for the BT transport layer.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

4. The code changes in the patch involve replacing the old function call with the new one:

   - The condition `if (!hdev->hid_output_raw_report)` is replaced with `if (!hdev->ll_driver->output_report)`.
   - The function call `hid_output_raw_report(hdev, buf, count, HID_OUTPUT_REPORT)` is replaced with `hid_hw_output_report(hdev, buf, count)`.

5. The patch appears to be a straightforward replacement of function calls without introducing any new functionality or fixing any real and critical bugs.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes in the patch can be considered as trivial fixes, as they involve replacing one function call with another.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and related code that sets and uses it. This change indicates that the frequency is no longer needed or used in the code.

2. The patch introduces a new parameter "freq" in the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function, which is used to calculate the clock divider. This change allows the clock divider to be set in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer.

3. The patch modifies the "meson_i2c_probe" function to read the "clock-frequency" property from the device tree and store it in the "freq" variable. If the property is not found, it assigns a default frequency value.

4. Finally, the patch calls the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function with the "freq" parameter in the "meson_i2c_probe" function to set the clock divider.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a clean-up and optimization change, removing unused code and improving the initialization process.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the omapdrm driver in the Linux kernel. It changes the log level of certain error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer object size validation. Instead of printing these messages as errors, they are now printed as debug messages.

The reason for this change is to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages by validating userspace parameters. By turning these error messages into debug messages, the patch aims to reduce unnecessary noise in the kernel log.

This change does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving the logging behavior and preventing potential log flooding.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on the specific issue mentioned above.

Considering these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the behavior of the omapdrm driver without introducing any significant risks or regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling the `vfree()` function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only moves the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` to the file `smilsub.c` and removes the unnecessary declaration in `smilmain.c`. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. The patch sets the appropriate exit reason and suberror codes when instruction emulation fails, allowing for better error reporting to userspace.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug by improving error reporting, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the IPv6 raw socket implementation. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch changes the function signature of `rawv6_send_hdrinc` to include a `struct msghdr *msg` parameter instead of `void *from`. This change allows the function to directly access the `msg` structure, which contains the necessary information for sending the IPv6 header.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `msg->iov_iter.iov` with `msg->msg_iter.iov` in the `memcpy_fromiovecend` call. This change ensures that the correct data is copied from the `msg` structure to the IPv6 header.

3. The patch updates the call to `rawv6_send_hdrinc` in the `rawv6_sendmsg` function to pass the `msg` structure directly instead of casting it to `struct iovec *`. This change simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary type casting.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug in the IPv6 raw socket implementation and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The failure logging in the function `isl29028_set_als_scale()` is moved from the callers to the function itself. This helps reduce code duplication and improves maintainability.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The change in `isl29028_set_als_scale()` adds error handling by logging an error message using `dev_err()` if `regmap_update_bits()` fails. This is important for debugging and improving the driver's robustness.

4. The change in `isl29028_write_raw()` removes the duplicate logging of the failure message when `isl29028_set_als_scale()` fails. This improves code clarity and reduces redundancy.

5. The change in `isl29028_chip_init_and_power_on()` simplifies the code by directly returning the result of `isl29028_set_als_scale()` instead of assigning it to a variable. This improves code readability.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue, improves code maintainability, and adds error handling. It does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes a typo in the zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c files, it appears to be a trivial fix involving spelling changes. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that only renames a function in the rtl8192e staging driver. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a separate function for resetting shadow counters in the perf stat tool. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any of the mentioned issues explicitly.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only corrects the initialization of the ".n_bitrates" field in the mwifiex_band_2ghz structure to use the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead of hardcoding the value.

Since this patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility on the s390 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new field "has_ibs" of type unsigned char to the "struct sclp_info" in "arch/s390/include/asm/sclp.h". This field is used to indicate whether the system has the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility.

2. In "drivers/s390/char/sclp_early.c", the patch updates the "sclp.has_ibs" field based on the value of "sccb->fac117 & 0x20". This means that the "has_ibs" field will be set to 1 if the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility is supported.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding support for detecting a specific hardware facility on the s390 architecture. It does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it only adds support for a new hardware facility without addressing any critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` to check the device readiness. This function returns a boolean value indicating whether the device is ready or not. This seems to be a valid addition as it provides a necessary functionality.

2. The patch also sets the `dev_ready` function pointer of the `nand_chip` structure to `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready`. This ensures that the newly added function is used to check the device readiness. This is a necessary modification to make use of the new function.

3. Additionally, the patch sets the `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure to 50. This value represents the delay in microseconds between chip select and command execution. This modification seems reasonable and necessary for proper device operation.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real issue by adding a necessary function and making relevant modifications to the `nand_chip` structure. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the given criteria, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch simply adds a comment and sets the `scanmask` value to `0xffff` in order to support NEC remotes with 24 or 32 bits. This does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the firmware image filename for the xc4000 tuner. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it is a cosmetic change that improves the filename for public release.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "tty: serial: Fix termios/port flags mismatch" and suggests a fix for a termios/port flags mismatch issue in the serial driver.

2. Problem Description: The patch addresses a problem where the termios settings are not properly synchronized with the port flags in the serial driver.

3. Impact: This issue can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption in serial communication.

4. Patch Analysis: The patch modifies the `uart_change_speed` function and the `uart_set_termios` function in the `serial_core.c` file.

5. Patch Details:
   - In the `uart_change_speed` function, the patch moves the `uport->ops->set_termios` call before setting the `ASYNC_CTS_FLOW` and `ASYNC_CHECK_CD` flags based on the termios settings.
   - In the `uart_set_termios` function, the patch adds a line to reload the `cflag` from the termios settings after calling `uart_change_speed`.

6. Justification for Inclusion in -stable Releases:
   - The patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption in serial communication.
   - The issue is not trivial and requires a code change to fix.
   - The patch does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption in serial communication.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the `qos_request` field from the `saa7134_fh` structure to the `saa7134_dev` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the patch should not be accepted (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for handling ECC errors during the scanning of simple bad block markers in the MTD NAND driver. The patch introduces a change to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers, as it assumes that the relevant markers are still non-0xFF for true bad blocks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a specific scenario related to ECC errors during the scanning process.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the bus watcher from a deprecated __initcall to a device_initcall. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch enables setting the minimum inline header mode for Virtual Functions (VFs) in the mlx5 driver.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to modify the minimum inline header mode for a specific VF. It takes the mlx5 core device, VF vport number, and the desired minimum inline value as parameters. The function constructs the necessary input data structure and calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` to modify the VF's minimum inline header mode.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch introduces a new functionality to modify the minimum inline header mode for VFs. This can be useful in certain scenarios where fine-tuning the inline header mode is required for optimal performance. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the interaction between freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature in Btrfs. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a fix for the issue where the auto defragmentation feature continues to run even when the file system is frozen. This is a potential problem because freezing the file system implies that no background operations should be running.

2. The patch modifies the __btrfs_run_defrag_inode() function in the fs/btrfs/file.c file.

3. It initializes a range variable and sets its length to the maximum value and the start offset to the defrag->last_offset value.

4. The patch then calls sb_start_write() to acquire a write lock on the superblock associated with the file system.

5. After acquiring the write lock, it calls btrfs_defrag_file() to perform the defragmentation operation on the given inode within the specified range.

6. Finally, the patch calls sb_end_write() to release the write lock on the superblock.

7. The comment suggests that if the defrag batch is filled completely, there is more work to do, and the defrag operation should be queued for further processing.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the behavior of the defragmentation process based on the file system's frozen state.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies ternary operators using a GNU extension. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of whitespace cleanup and code simplification. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: adau17x1: Cleanup manual bias level transitions." It suggests cleaning up the manual bias level transitions in the ASoC driver for the adau17x1 codec.

2. The patch sets the CODEC driver's suspend_bias_off flag instead of manually transitioning to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in suspend and SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in resume. This change aims to make the code shorter and cleaner.

3. The patch modifies the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures by removing the suspend function and adding the suspend_bias_off flag set to true.

4. The patch also removes the adau17x1_suspend function from adau17x1.c and removes the call to set_bias_level with SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in adau17x1_resume.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a cleanup and optimization of the manual bias level transitions in the ASoC driver for the adau17x1 codec. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch can be considered as trivial fixes, as they aim to make the code shorter and cleaner.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" and ".bus" fields from the b53_spi_driver structure. These fields are no longer necessary because the module_spi_driver() function is used, which automatically sets them.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the format string specifier for size_t variables in the HID cp2112 driver. The change replaces the use of "%d" with "%zd" in two debug print statements.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "drm/nva3/fb/ram" file of the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the "nva3_ram_ctor" function in the "ramnva3.c" file.
2. It updates the initialization of several registers in the "ram" structure.
3. The registers being modified are: 0x100760, 0x1007a0, 0x1007e0, 0x1110e0.
4. The original code initializes these registers using the "ramfuc_reg" function.
5. The patch replaces the initialization with the "ramfuc_stride" function, passing additional arguments: 4 and "ram->base.part_mask".

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a functional change by replacing the initialization of certain registers with the "ramfuc_stride" function. However, without further context or information about the purpose and impact of this change, it is difficult to determine whether it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue being addressed, the impact it has on the system, and any potential risks or side effects associated with the patch. Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event` in the ASoC twl6040 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch is titled "ASoC: max98090: read micbias from device property."
   - It mentions that the patch reads max98090 micbias from ACPI or device tree (DT).

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Fang, Yang A <yang.a.fang@intel.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>.
   - Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/max98090.txt is also mentioned as a sign-off.

3. Changes in the Patch:
   - The patch adds a new optional property called "maxim,micbias" to the device.
   - The property defines the micbias voltage for the analog mic, with valid voltage values ranging from 2.2v to 2.8v.
   - The patch also includes a comment explaining the valid voltage values.

4. Code Changes:
   - In the max98090_probe() function in max98090.c, the patch adds code to read the "maxim,micbias" property from the device.
   - If the property is not found, a default value of 2.8v is used, and a dev_info message is printed.
   - If the property is found but the value is out of the valid range, a dev_err message is printed, and the default value of 2.8v is used.
   - The micbias value is then used to update the MIC_BIAS_VOLTAGE register.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug by adding support for reading the micbias voltage from the device property. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit in the simple_hdmi*() refactoring. The patch corrects the assignment of the pin NID, which was not assigned correctly before. The issue was reported by Annie Liu and the patch is signed-off by Takashi Iwai.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a regression and does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers for the s390 architecture. The "owner" field is used to keep track of the module that "owns" the driver, but in this case, it is not necessary as the driver core will populate it automatically.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture. The warning indicates a mismatch between the function leon_callin() and the function leon_configure_cache_smp() in terms of their initialization attributes.

Since this patch addresses a section mismatch warning and does not fix a real and critical bug, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the log level from `pr_info` to `pr_debug` for a success message. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be defining the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial change that adds definitions for the contiguous bit.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to mark the function `resiliency_test()` as `__init`, indicating that it should be placed in the `init.text` section and freed after boot. 

Since `resiliency_test()` is only called during the bootstrap process, marking it as `__init` and freeing it after boot can help optimize memory usage. This change does not appear to fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering these factors, this patch seems to be a trivial optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds support for a specific hardware feature, the SFP insertion interrupt, on X550EM devices with SFPs. This indicates that it addresses a specific functionality or behavior related to the hardware.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the `ixgbe_irq_enable` function to enable the SFP insertion interrupt for X550EM devices with SFPs. It checks the device ID and enables the interrupt if the device matches the specified ID.

3. The patch includes the necessary conditional check to enable the interrupt only for X550EM devices with SFPs. This ensures that the interrupt is not enabled for other devices that do not support it.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific hardware feature and enables the SFP insertion interrupt for X550EM devices with SFPs. It does not appear to fix a critical bug, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be specific to the hardware and do not have a broader impact on the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant NULL check and a check for DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value in the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made and evaluate if they meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch updates the initialization of the nvm channel list for 8000 devices in the iwlwifi driver. This is done to ensure that the regulatory data contains the correct channels for the 8000 series devices.

2. The patch adds a new parameter `const struct iwl_cfg *cfg` to the function `iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info()`. This parameter is used to determine the device family and select the appropriate channel list.

3. The patch updates the usage of `iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info()` in `iwl_mvm_get_regdomain()` to pass the `mvm->cfg` parameter.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the nvm channel list for 8000 series devices. This can be considered a real and critical bug as it could potentially lead to incorrect regulatory data and impact the functionality of the affected devices.

Considering that the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix that improves the code by using the core function `irq_set_affinity()` instead of a custom implementation. The patch also switches to using `for_each_active_irq()` instead of iterating over all IRQ descriptors.

Since this patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch updates the imp_known_replied_xid when trying to resend an already replied replay request. This is done because the xid of the replay request could be less than the current imp_known_replied_xid.

2. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch involve adding a check to update imp_known_replied_xid when a replay request is resent and its rq_unreplied_list is empty. The imp_known_replied_xid is updated using the ptlrpc_known_replied_xid() function.

3. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific scenario where the imp_known_replied_xid needs to be updated correctly. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not seem to be trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds module alias autogeneration for AMBA drivers in the nomadik-rng.c file.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes a trivial typo in a comment, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch contains a "trivial" fix, which is a spelling change. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary assignment to the variable "mq_rq" in the mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() function. This assignment is not used after the jump, and it seems to be confusing and unnecessary.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization for ARMv6 and later processors. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the sti_vtg driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a missing of_node_put call after calling of_parse_phandle. This indicates that the device node obtained from of_parse_phandle is being used and needs to be released properly.

2. The patch includes appropriate Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The patch also includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website, providing additional context and discussion about the patch.

4. The code change itself is relatively simple and does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue and meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "__init" annotation from the "gpmc_hwecc_bch_capable" and "gpmc_nand_init" functions in the "gpmc-nand.c" file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch mainly involve converting the set_frontend and get_frontend functions to use DVBv5 parameters instead of the dvb_frontend_parameters struct.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains only trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding the necessary MFD (Multi-Function Device) cell information for the axp288 power key device. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the MFD cell info for the axp288 power key device, which suggests that it addresses a specific hardware functionality.

2. The patch includes the necessary resource definitions for the power button part of the axp288 PMICs, indicating that it is fixing a real and critical bug related to power button functionality.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

4. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the axp288 power key device. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames the PVOID type to "void *" in the Misc.c file of the bcm staging driver, it appears to be a trivial fix involving a simple renaming of a type. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch is simply replacing the existing driver registration and unregistration calls with the new platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only introduces a minor code change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. It seems to be a trivial change in the order of error handling labels.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to indicate that a set contains expressions for evaluation. It also includes a check to reject sets that specify both mapping and evaluation operations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific adaptation for the OMAP3 platform, specifically the igep0020 board. The patch modifies the initialization of USB host controllers (usbhs) and registers the PHY's RESET regulators and NOP PHY devices using the usbhs_init_phys() function.

Upon analyzing the patch, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a specific adaptation for the igep0020 board to accommodate changes in the ehci-omap driver.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for port mirroring in the bcm_sf2 driver for the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) framework in the Linux kernel. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to add a new feature (port mirroring) rather than fixing a bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not indicate any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not mention any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the vmwgfx driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch is signed-off by Jakob Bornecrantz and reviewed by Thomas Hellstrom, both from VMware. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review.

3. The patch modifies the file vmwgfx_kms.c in the drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/ directory.

4. In the code changes, a check is added to verify if the surface is suitable for use as a cursor. If it is not suitable, an error message is printed, and the surface is unreferenced using the vmw_surface_unreference() function. Finally, an error code is returned.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue where an unsuitable surface is being used as a cursor in the vmwgfx driver. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could cause issues with the vmwgfx driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a superfluous check and a stray newline. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch only makes the "i40e_gstrings_stats" structure const, which does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of READ_TOPOLOGY reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the function `lpfc_mbx_cmpl_read_topology` in the file `drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_hbadisc.c`.

2. The patch introduces changes to handle the `fc_eventTag` and `sli_rev` variables.

3. The patch adds a condition to check if `phba->fc_eventTag` is less than or equal to `la->eventTag`. If true, it increments `phba->fc_stat.LinkMultiEvent` and performs additional actions based on the value of `bf_get(lpfc_mbx_read_top_att_type, la)`.

4. The patch updates the value of `phba->fc_eventTag` to `la->eventTag`.

5. The patch adds a condition to check if `phba->sli_rev` is less than `LPFC_SLI_REV4`. If true, it acquires a lock, updates `phba->sli.sli_flag` based on `bf_get(lpfc_mbx_read_top_mm, la)`, and releases the lock.

6. The patch increments `phba->link_events` and performs additional actions based on the values of `bf_get(lpfc_mbx_read_top_att_type, la)` and `phba->sli.sli_flag`.

7. The patch adds a condition to check if `phba->sli.sli_flag` has the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag set and `bf_get(lpfc_mbx_read_top_att_type, la)` is `LPFC_ATT_LINK_UP`. If true, it performs additional actions.

8. The patch adds a condition to check if `phba->sli_rev` is less than `LPFC_SLI_REV4` and `bf_get(lpfc_mbx_read_top_fa, la)` is true. If true, it performs additional actions.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields in the lpfc driver. It does not seem to address any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving the validation of sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance values. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a check to prevent users from directly writing negative values to the sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance attribute. This is important because negative values may have unintended consequences and could potentially cause issues.

2. The patch uses the kstrtos32() function to convert the input buffer to a signed 32-bit integer value. If the conversion is successful (kstrtos32() returns 0), the patch checks if the value is negative. If it is, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid input.

3. If the conversion fails (kstrtos32() returns a non-zero value), the patch checks if the input buffer is equal to "auto" or "auto\n". If it is, the value is set to PM_QOS_LATENCY_TOLERANCE_NO_CONSTRAINT. Otherwise, if the input buffer is equal to "any" or "any\n", the value is left unchanged.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue by preventing users from directly writing negative values to the sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance attribute, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior. In IPv4, when a machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will get an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

2. The patch modifies the UDP error handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. When the machine receives an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message, the connected UDP socket will get an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

3. The patch includes the necessary code changes in the `__udp6_lib_err` function in `net/ipv6/udp.c`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug in the Linux kernel. It fixes a discrepancy in behavior between IPv4 and IPv6, ensuring that UDP sockets in IPv6 receive EMSGSIZE messages when appropriate. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the tty driver. The patch changes the return value from -ENOIOCTLCMD to -ENOTTY when a specific condition is met.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch should not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

In this case, the patch addresses an error handling issue by correcting the return value. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption, it does fix an incorrect behavior that could potentially lead to unexpected results when using the ioctl function. Therefore, it can be considered a real issue that needs to be fixed.

Furthermore, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on correcting the error handling behavior, which is a non-trivial change.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devexit_p. This macro is no longer needed because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is aimed at improving the efficiency of the brightness setting for the netxbig LED driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch sets the `led_classdev max_brightness` to the maximum level supported by the hardware. This eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in the `brightness_set()` function. This change can potentially improve performance and reduce unnecessary calculations.

2. The `bright_max` variable is removed from the `struct netxbig_led_data`. This variable was previously used to store the maximum brightness value, but since the max brightness is now set directly in the `led_classdev`, it is no longer needed.

3. In the `netxbig_led_set()` function, the `bright_val` variable is removed, and the brightness value is set directly using the `value` parameter. This change simplifies the code and eliminates the need for the brightness conversion calculation.

4. In the `create_netxbig_led()` function, the `max_brightness` field of the `led_classdev` is set to the `template->bright_max` value. This ensures that the maximum brightness value is correctly initialized.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is a valid improvement to the netxbig LED driver. It eliminates unnecessary calculations and simplifies the code without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific performance bottleneck issue when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. The patch sets the CmdQue bit in the standard INQUIRY data to 1.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific performance optimization for a particular use case.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not meet the requirements for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and renaming of the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()`. The patch also moves the reference acquisition into the `init_and_link_css()` function.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This indicates that the function is only called in functions annotated with __init, which suggests that it is used during the initialization phase of the kernel.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal usage.

3. The prandom_start_seed_timer() function is responsible for setting up a timer that triggers the reseeding of the random number generator. This is an important functionality for ensuring the security and randomness of generated numbers.

4. The patch ensures that the __prandom_start_seed_timer() function is called during the initialization phase of the kernel by adding the __init prefix to it.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a critical bug related to the initialization of the random number generator and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the code to use devm_ functions. This type of change is typically considered a "trivial" fix and does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch uses `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` instead of `regmap_init_i2c()`. This change makes the regmap initialization device-managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup.

2. The patch fixes a potential bug by adding the missing `regmap_exit` call. This ensures proper cleanup in case of errors.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Sachin Kamat and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, but rather addresses a potential issue with regmap initialization.

Based on these factors, the patch seems to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Anton Blanchard, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Cc: The patch is also sent to several individuals, including Ingo Molnar, Jiri Olsa, Namhyung Kim, Paul Mackerras, and Peter Zijlstra, for their awareness and potential review.

4. Link: The patch includes links to the original message and the patch itself for reference.

5. Code Changes: The patch modifies the vmlinux_path__init() function in the symbol.c file.

6. Line 1757: The patch increases the size of the vmlinux_path array from 5 to 6.

7. Line 1788: The patch adds a new entry to the vmlinux_path array, pointing to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

8. Line 1793: The patch adds another entry to the vmlinux_path array, pointing to the vmlinux file in the kernel build directory.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds the necessary path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file and updates the vmlinux_path array accordingly. This change does not seem to fix a critical bug or address any security issue. It appears to be a non-trivial fix related to debugging and symbol resolution.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks for the `moboard_uart0` function in the `mach-mx31moboard.c` file.

2. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is modified to remove the return type and instead use `void`. It also removes the `gpio_free()` call from the function.

3. The `uart0_pdata` structure in the `mach-mx31moboard.c` file no longer contains the `init` and `exit` fields.

4. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is called in the `mx31moboard_init()` function in the same file.

5. In the `serial_imx_probe()` function in the `imx.c` file, the call to `pdata->init()` is removed.

6. The `serial_imx_remove()` function in the same file no longer calls `pdata->exit()`.

7. The `imxuart_platform_data` structure in the `serial-imx.h` file no longer contains the `init` and `exit` fields.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks and related code. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes seem to be more of a cleanup or removal of unnecessary code rather than fixing any problematic behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rt2800: initialize BBP_R103 on all subroutines (except 5592)".
2. It is signed-off by Stanislaw Gruszka and has been acknowledged by Helmut Schaa and Gertjan van Wingerde.
3. The patch modifies the file "drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2800lib.c".

Looking at the changes made in the patch:

1. In the function "rt2800_init_bbp_305x_soc", a new line is added to initialize BBP register 103 with the value 0xc0.
2. In the function "rt2800_init_bbp_28xx", a new line is added to initialize BBP register 103 with the value 0x00.
3. In the function "rt2800_init_bbp_30xx", a conditional statement is added to check the device revision and initialize BBP register 103 accordingly.
4. Similar changes are made in the functions "rt2800_init_bbp_3290", "rt2800_init_bbp_3352", "rt2800_init_bbp_3390", "rt2800_init_bbp_3572", and "rt2800_init_bbp_53xx".

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch initializes the BBP register 103 in various subroutines of the rt2800 driver based on the device revision. This change seems to be addressing a specific issue related to the initialization of the BBP register.

However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the changes made.

Therefore, based on the available information, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. Further clarification and justification for the changes would be necessary to make a more informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sizeimage setting in the coda driver for the media subsystem. The bug causes VIDIOC_TRY_FMT to return an incorrect value for sizeimage. The patch corrects this by calculating sizeimage as width * height * 3 / 2.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch appears to be related to the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset.
2. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC for setting the number of transmit USB buffers.
3. However, there are a few issues with the patch:
   a. The module_param_named line contains a typo where it uses "vnt_rx_buffers" instead of "vnt_tx_buffers".
   b. The check for the user setting the tx_buffer beyond the defined limits of the driver is missing.
   c. The patch modifies the device_set_options function to set the number of TX buffers based on the value of vnt_tx_buffers, but it does not handle the case where vnt_tx_buffers is not set by the user.
4. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.
5. The changes introduced by the patch seem to be more of a configuration adjustment rather than fixing a critical issue.

Considering these points, the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of non-device managed APIs with their device managed counterparts. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function call with a recommended alternative. The change does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that avoids an unnecessary register read. It does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary. It splits the function up to improve clarity.

2. The patch is signed-off by Christoph Hellwig and reviewed by Hannes Reinecke. It is also signed-off by James Bottomley.

3. The patch modifies the scsi_run_queue function, which is responsible for selecting a proper request queue to serve next.

4. The scsi_starved_list_run function is introduced to handle starved devices without taking the host lock unnecessarily.

5. The scsi_single_lun_run function is called if the scsi_target has a single LUN.

6. The scsi_starved_list_run function is called if the starved_list is not empty.

7. Finally, the patch calls blk_run_queue to run the queue.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and improving the handling of starved devices. It does not seem to introduce any trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on code aesthetics and renaming a function. The changes do not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field from the "sl811h_driver" structure in the "sl811-hcd.c" file. The patch claims to fix the "platform_no_drv_owner.cocci" warnings.

Since this patch only removes a single line of code and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ARM: amba: netx: get rid of NO_IRQ initializers." This suggests that it aims to remove the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field of the amba_device structure in the netx driver.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the .irq field is modified from ".irq = { NETX_IRQ_LCD, NO_IRQ }" to ".irq = { NETX_IRQ_LCD }". This change removes the NO_IRQ initializer.

3. The NO_IRQ initializer is typically used to indicate that a device does not have an interrupt associated with it. However, in this case, it seems that the NETX_IRQ_LCD is the only interrupt associated with the device.

4. Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, we need to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

5. From the provided patch, it appears that the change is not fixing any of the mentioned critical issues. Instead, it seems to be a cleanup or optimization change.

6. Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues explicitly mentioned in the patch description.

Based on the analysis, I would conclude that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While it may be a valid code cleanup, it does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the SPI bus clocks from the platform data. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function called `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given device index is non-zero. If it is, it proceeds with the lookup process.

3. Inside the lookup process, the function acquires an RCU read lock to ensure safe access to the network device.

4. It then uses the `dev_get_by_index_rcu` function to retrieve the network device corresponding to the given index.

5. If a valid network device is found, the function calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to obtain the master index of the l3mdev.

6. Finally, the function releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index if found, or 0 otherwise.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary helper function to facilitate the lookup of l3mdev master indexes. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to l3mdev functionality.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an uninitialized variable warning. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and adjusting indentation. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow warning in the btrfs filesystem's send functionality. The expression "sizeof(*arg->clone_sources) * arg->clone_sources_count" is checked for potential overflow.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value of ULLONG_MAX. If the multiplication would result in an overflow, the patch returns -EINVAL and exits.

3. The issue is not considered critical as it is only triggered under CAP_SYS_ADMIN, which limits the impact. However, it is still important to address the warning to maintain code quality.

4. The patch has been reviewed by David Sterba and signed-off by Dan Carpenter and David Sterba, indicating that it has undergone peer review and testing.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - move DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk for alc255". It suggests moving a specific quirk for the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `patch_realtek.c` file in the `sound/pci/hda` directory. It involves changes to the `alc269_fixup_tbl` and `alc269_pin_fixup_tbl` arrays.

3. Changes in `alc269_fixup_tbl`:
   The patch removes two entries related to the Dell system with ALC255 codec and the DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk. This suggests that the quirk is being moved to a different location.

4. Changes in `alc269_pin_fixup_tbl`:
   The patch adds a new entry for the Dell system with ALC255 codec and the DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk. It includes specific pin configurations for various audio input/output ports.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is modifying the quirk configuration for the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a security issue.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further investigation and information are required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that enables the use of PCI MSIs for the rt2x00pci driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a type mismatch issue in the `capi20_manufacturer` function. The function is declared with an `unsigned int` argument, but it is called with an `unsigned long` argument. This can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or bugs.

2. The patch corrects the function prototype to match the actual argument type used in the function call. This ensures that the function is correctly defined and used according to the user-visible API.

3. The patch includes a sign-off from the original author and the maintainer, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The change was spotted with Coverity, which suggests that it has undergone some level of code analysis and scrutiny.

5. The patch does not appear to be a trivial fix, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue that could potentially cause problems or bugs.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate error message. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. The macro "IS_MAC_ADDRESS_BROADCAST" is no longer used in the code and is being removed. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to refactor the code of the `soft_offline_page()` function in the `mm/memory-failure.c` file. Refactoring the code can improve readability and maintainability.

2. The patch addresses the issue of multiple return points randomly intermingled with some "goto done" return points. It adjusts the function structure to have separate paths for success and failure, which can make the code more organized and easier to understand.

3. The patch replaces the use of `atomic_long_add` with `atomic_long_inc` for incrementing the `mce_bad_pages` counter. This change is a performance improvement and does not affect the functionality of the code.

4. The patch handles error cases properly by setting the appropriate return value and using the `goto out` label to ensure proper cleanup before returning.

5. The changes made in the patch do not fall under the category of "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. The refactoring and code structure adjustments are meaningful changes that can improve code quality.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, improves code structure, and does not contain trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary out-of-memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for checking the return values of the nla_parse() function. The patch ensures that the policy is not useless and that the attributes are actually what is expected.

Additionally, the changes are related to critical areas such as setting wireless parameters, regulatory rules, and scheduling scans, which can have a significant impact on the functionality and security of the system.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue related to attribute parsing and ensures the correctness and reliability of the affected functionality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `of_find_property` with `of_property_read_u32` for reading integer values. This change aims to reduce the number of variables used.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a call to `seq_printf` with `seq_puts` for a specific string. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any of the mentioned issues explicitly.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the given criteria, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the i40e driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions in the i40e driver.

2. The change ensures that these functions are not used when the VLAN ID (VID) is less than 1 or when the Port VLAN ID (PVID) is set.

3. The functions are updated to take a u16 (unsigned 16-bit integer) as the VID parameter instead of s16 (signed 16-bit integer), as they no longer expect to be called with VID=I40E_VLAN_ANY.

4. The patch also includes changes to the i40e_add_vlan_all_mac and i40e_rm_vlan_all_mac functions, which are called by i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan, respectively.

5. The i40e_vsi_add_vlan function now returns -EINVAL if the VID is 0 or if the PVID is set, indicating an invalid VLAN configuration.

6. The i40e_vsi_kill_vlan function now checks if the VID is 0 or if the PVID is set before removing the VLAN membership.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to VLAN configuration in the i40e driver. It ensures that the functions are not used in certain scenarios and adds appropriate error handling. Since it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect VLAN configurations, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds a new netdev operation to allow or prevent a Virtual Function (VF) from querying its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It limits the support for this feature to 82599 and x540 devices only, with plans to add support for other devices later.

2. Code Changes:
   - In the `ixgbe.h` file, a new boolean variable `rss_query_enabled` is added to the `vf_data_storage` structure.
   - In the `ixgbe_main.c` file, the `ixgbe_configure_virtualization` function is modified to enable or disable the RSS query feature for each VF.
   - In the `ixgbe_netdev_ops` structure, the `ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en` function is added to handle the new netdev operation.
   - In the `ixgbe_sriov.c` file, the `__ixgbe_enable_sriov` function is modified to set the `rss_query_enabled` variable to 0 for all VFs.
   - In the `ixgbe_sriov.h` file, the `ixgbe_ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en` function is declared.

3. Analysis:
   This patch introduces a new netdev operation to control the ability of a VF to query its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It is limited to specific devices and sets the default value of `rss_query_enabled` to 0 for all VFs. The patch appears to be focused on enabling or disabling a specific feature for VFs on supported devices.

   Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical bug or a security issue. It seems to be more of a feature enhancement rather than a fix for an existing issue.

4. Recommendation:
   Given the information available, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Without a clear indication of a critical bug or security issue being addressed, it is advisable to not include this patch in the stable release.

Therefore, the recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The MMC core assumes that the clock will be gated when the bus frequency is set to 0, but this behavior has been ignored so far. This bug can potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or system instability.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications.

3. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reviewed and acknowledged by Chen-Yu Tsai and tested by Florian Vaussard, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and validation.

4. The changes in the patch are focused and targeted: The patch modifies the `sunxi_mmc_clk_set_rate` and `sunxi_mmc_set_ios` functions in the `sunxi-mmc.c` file, specifically addressing the clock gating issue when the bus frequency is set to 0.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip. The patch increases the total number of interrupts from 8 to 34, which aligns with the three different interrupt ranges handled by the TWL4030 (8 for the core, 8 for power events, and 18 for GPIOs).

Since this patch fixes a real issue related to interrupt management and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to extend the frequency range of the Max2165 tuner driver to cover Hong Kong's digital TV broadcasting. The change increases the maximum frequency from 780000000 to 862000000.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a specific enhancement to support a particular TV tuner card in Hong Kong.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a configuration issue related to antenna diversity for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. The patch introduces conditional logic to set different values for the antenna configuration based on the chip type.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a specific configuration issue for non-AR9485 chips.

Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, as they involve adjusting specific values based on the chip type. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to parenthesis alignment in the ppdev driver. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds an additional compatible string "marvell,armada370-audio" to the existing compatible strings "marvell,kirkwood-audio" and "marvell,dove-audio" in the device tree bindings for sound/mvebu-audio.txt. This allows the Kirkwood audio driver to be built on mvebu platforms, specifically for the Armada 370 variant.

2. In sound/soc/kirkwood/Kconfig, the patch modifies the dependency of SND_KIRKWOOD_SOC to include ARCH_MVEBU in addition to ARCH_KIRKWOOD, ARCH_DOVE, and COMPILE_TEST. This ensures that the Kirkwood audio driver is selected when building the kernel for mvebu platforms.

3. In sound/soc/kirkwood/kirkwood-i2s.c, the patch adds the "marvell,armada370-audio" compatible string to the mvebu_audio_of_match array. This allows the Kirkwood audio driver to match with the Armada 370 audio unit when probing the device tree.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a real issue by enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically for the Armada 370 variant. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the device tree bindings and adding a new compatible string. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'thisboard' macro and replaces it with local variables and the comedi_board() helper function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the fec driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds support for specifying a phy reset duration in the device tree, allowing different boards to have different reset durations if needed. 

This patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new optional property to the device tree bindings for the fec driver.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It appears to be a "trivial" fix, as it adds a new optional property without addressing any critical issues. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting pointer math to array access. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves interrupt handling in the meson-gx MMC driver.
2. The patch removes the unnecessary disabling and re-enabling of interrupts in the meson_mmc_request function, as it doesn't provide any benefit.
3. Instead, interrupts are enabled in the probe function, which is the appropriate place to enable interrupts.
4. The patch also adds the missing disabling of interrupts in the remove function.
5. The changes in the meson_mmc_probe and meson_mmc_remove functions ensure that interrupts are properly handled during device initialization and removal.
6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to interrupt handling in the meson-gx MMC driver and improves the stability and reliability of the driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb driver. The "__devinit" attribute is used to mark functions that are only called during device initialization and can be discarded after that. However, since the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option is going away, the "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed.

Considering that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be classified as a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compile warning in the ARM implementation of psci_init. The change simply adds a return statement with a value of 0 to the inline function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve dropping unneeded checks and removing some conditional statements. Since the patch does not address any specific issue or bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves code efficiency by avoiding redundant function calls. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant type casting. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture. The patch modifies the code to ensure that device tree accesses in the cache info code are endian safe.

The patch changes the type of the variables `cache_size`, `line_size`, and `nr_sets` from `u32` to `__be32`. It also replaces the assignment of `*ret` with `of_read_number()` to handle the endianness correctly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue related to endianness.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointer to the `musb` structure from the `tusb_omap_dma` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that makes the functions `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. These functions are currently defined as non-static, meaning they can be accessed from other files. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only modifies the visibility of these functions, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch.pl issue related to lines exceeding 80 characters. This type of fix falls under the category of "trivial" changes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a few missing clocks for different MIPS platforms. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential issue with the order of operations in the dsa_slave_create() function. The patch ensures that the netdev is registered before connecting the phy, which avoids an info message with an uninitialized name.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch replaces the direct comparison of jiffies with a more robust function, time_before, to compare jiffies against other values. This change improves the reliability and readability of the code.

Since the patch addresses a potential issue with comparing jiffies and introduces a more robust method, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the struct device pointer to point to the USB device instead of the input device. This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of BUG_ON macro from the mmc_ext_csd_open function in debugfs.c. The use of BUG_ON is replaced with proper error handling.

2. The patch introduces an error variable 'err' and sets it to -EINVAL if the value of 'n' is not equal to EXT_CSD_STR_LEN. This change ensures that an appropriate error value is returned to the caller instead of triggering a BUG_ON, which is considered a more meaningful behavior.

3. The patch includes a 'goto out_free' statement to handle the error case and free the allocated memory before returning.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, the patch addresses a potential issue in the mmc_ext_csd_open function by introducing proper error handling. It does not introduce any trivial changes and is focused on fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the attribute index for temperature sensors in the ixgbe driver to start with 1 instead of 0, following the hwmon ABI.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (changing attribute index), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless cast in the code. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the default behavior of the perf tools. The patch removes the "filter_relative" option, which is a relatively minor change and does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the mos7720.c driver to use the module_usb_serial_driver() call instead of having a module_init/module_exit function. This change eliminates duplicated code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary braces in the code. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves an assignment statement out of an if () block. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Title: hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host
   - The patch aims to handle the case where the host reduces the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the `nvsp_message` structure in `netvsc.c` to include the new MTU value.
   - It also updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function in `netvsc_drv.c` to set the limit for MTU based on `NETVSC_MTU - ETH_HLEN`.
   - Additionally, it adds code in `rndis_filter_device_add` function in `rndis_filter.c` to retrieve the MTU value from the host.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific scenario where the host reduces the MTU due to encapsulation requirements.
   - It ensures that the new MTU value is properly handled in the `nvsp_message` structure.
   - The `netvsc_change_mtu` function is updated to set the correct limit for MTU based on `NETVSC_MTU - ETH_HLEN`.
   - The `rndis_filter_device_add` function retrieves the MTU value from the host and assigns it to the network device.

4. Evaluation:
   - The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - It addresses a specific scenario related to MTU reduction by the host due to encapsulation requirements.
   - The changes made in the patch do not seem to introduce any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.).

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `sirfsoc_uart_set_termios` function by removing the `ioclk_rate` variable and the associated calculation of `clk_div_reg` based on it. Instead, it introduces a check for `port->uartclk` being equal to 150000000 before performing the fast calculation of `clk_div_reg` using the lookup table.

2. The patch also modifies the `sirfsoc_uart_probe` function by adding code to get the `clk` and store it in `sirfport->clk`. It then enables the clock and sets `port->uartclk` to the rate of the clock.

3. The `sirfsoc_uart_remove` function is also modified to disable and put the clock.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the baud rate calculation in the `sirfsoc_uart_set_termios` function. It introduces a check for the clock frequency and adjusts the calculation accordingly. Additionally, it adds clock handling code in the `sirfsoc_uart_probe` and `sirfsoc_uart_remove` functions.

Considering the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces an open-coded function call with a helper function. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the variable "num_drc_entries" from an unsigned int to an atomic_t. This change allows for atomic operations on the variable, eliminating the need for spinlocking around it.

2. The patch updates the decrement operation "--num_drc_entries" to "atomic_dec(&num_drc_entries)" and the increment operation "++num_drc_entries" to "atomic_inc(&num_drc_entries)". These changes ensure that the variable is modified atomically.

3. The patch also updates the initialization of "num_drc_entries" from "num_drc_entries = 0" to "atomic_set(&num_drc_entries, 0)". This change initializes the atomic variable correctly.

4. The patch modifies the code that checks the number of entries in the cache. Instead of using "num_drc_entries", it uses "atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)" to retrieve the value of the atomic variable.

5. The patch updates the code that prints the number of entries in the cache to use "atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)" instead of "num_drc_entries".

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of concurrent access to the "num_drc_entries" variable by converting it to an atomic variable and using atomic operations. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real issue related to synchronization and potential data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it exports the `confirm_error_lock` symbol so that it can be used in the PCI surprise hot remove path to freeze the affected PE. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code refactoring or an internal change that does not address any specific issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a formatting issue in the perf trace code. The patch adds a closing parenthesis ')' to the fprintf statement in the trace__sys_enter function. This change is necessary because the exit_group() function does not return, so there is no raw_syscalls:sys_exit event for it.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a minor formatting fix that does not affect the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment in the cxgb4vf driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the `do_gro` function in the `sge.c` file of the `cxgb4vf` driver.

2. The patch adds an increment to the `vlan_ex` counter in the `rxq->stats` structure when `pkt->vlan_ex` is true.

3. The `vlan_ex` counter is used to track the number of VLAN packets processed by the driver.

4. The patch also adds a call to `__vlan_hwaccel_put_tag` to set the VLAN tag on the received packet.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a bug related to VLAN extraction and correctly increments the `vlan_ex` counter. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug or whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

If this bug is causing a real and critical issue, such as a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, if the bug is not critical or the patch only contains trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, then it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please provide additional information or context about the bug and its impact to make a more accurate determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL function in the amdgpu driver. The patch adds amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in different cases of the switch statement, ensuring that the BO is unreserved before returning from the function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a potential issue related to resource reservation in the amdgpu driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch splits the function `media_graph_walk_next()` into two functions, `media_graph_walk_iter()` and `media_graph_walk_next()`. This refactoring does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable oprofile support on Lantiq targets. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not a fix for a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an AUXDATA entry for the "nvidia,tegra30-ahub" device. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the `finit_module` syscall in the SH architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

Since the patch is adding support for a new syscall, it does not directly fix a bug or address a critical issue. However, it is important to note that the `finit_module` syscall is used for loading and initializing kernel modules, which can have security implications. 

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if there is a real and critical bug or security issue related to the handling of kernel modules in the SH architecture. Otherwise, if there are no such issues, it may not be necessary to include this patch in the stable release (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply modifies the return value of the `rb532_gpio_get` function by using the `!!` design pattern to clamp the return value to [0,1]. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch is titled "mfd: twl6040: Check clk_prepare_enable() return value in twl6040_power()". This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to the twl6040 driver in the multi-function device (MFD) subsystem.

2. The patch description states that the clk_prepare_enable() function can fail, so it is necessary to check the return value and handle any failure appropriately.

3. The code change in the patch adds error handling for the clk_prepare_enable() function. It assigns the return value of clk_prepare_enable() to the 'ret' variable and checks if it is non-zero. If there is a failure, it resets the 'power_count' variable and jumps to the 'out' label, which likely contains cleanup code.

4. By checking the return value of clk_prepare_enable() and handling any failure, the patch ensures that any potential errors during clock preparation and enabling are properly handled. This is important for preventing issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug by adding necessary error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing duplicate code and using a generic function instead. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made and evaluate if they meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the function `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page` in the `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c` file. Here are the changes made:

1. A check is added before calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus` to verify if `sp->role.invalid` is false and `is_obsolete_sp(kvm, sp)` is false. If both conditions are met, `kvm_reload_remote_mmus` is called.

2. The `sp->role.invalid` flag is set to 1.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a specific issue. The patch seems to be adding a check to avoid unnecessary calls to `kvm_reload_remote_mmus` when certain conditions are met.

Without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is not possible to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation and clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers before making a decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()` to disable the ISA DMA controller and return the residue as described in `Documentation/DMA-ISA-LPC.txt`. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific functionality related to ISA DMA.

2. The patch includes changes to the `disable_dma_on_even()` function, where it now calls `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `get_dma_residue()`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch also modifies the `das16_interrupt()` function by removing the unnecessary `claim_dma_lock()` and `release_dma_lock()` calls, as well as the `clear_dma_ff()` call. These changes simplify the code and remove unnecessary operations.

4. The `das16_alloc_dma()` function is modified to use `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of `disable_dma()` and `release_dma_lock()`. This change improves consistency and readability.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific functionality related to ISA DMA and improves code readability and maintainability. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the nct6775 driver in the hwmon subsystem. The patch introduces a new function called "add_temp_sensors" which scans for additional temperature sources and enables monitoring if available. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

From the patch description and code changes, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it adds functionality to detect and report additional temperature sources. 

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It appears to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, the appropriate decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue in the USB gadget driver (dwc3) in the Linux kernel. The patch replaces a BUG() statement with a dev_WARN() statement to handle the case of an unknown endpoint type.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue related to an unknown endpoint type, which falls under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, since the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, it can be considered for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to vendor specific commands in the brcmfmac driver.
2. The change ensures that the vendor specific commands use the interface supplied by the caller instead of the main interface.
3. The patch has been reviewed by Arend Van Spriel and Pieter-Paul Giesberts from Broadcom.
4. It has been signed-off by Hante Meuleman, Arend van Spriel, and John W. Linville.
5. The code changes involve modifying the brcmf_cfg80211_vndr_cmds_dcmd_handler function to use the caller-supplied interface instead of the main interface.
6. The patch also includes some variable declarations and assignments related to the new interface usage.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the brcmfmac driver and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the serial-uartlite driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch aims to improve the efficiency of the spinlock usage inside the ulite_isr function.

2. The spinlock is now held for a shorter duration by moving the spin_lock_irqsave call inside the loop, just before the uart_in32 function call.

3. After acquiring the spinlock, the ulite_receive and ulite_transmit functions are called to perform necessary operations.

4. The spin_unlock_irqrestore call is moved inside the loop, just after the busy variable is updated.

5. The loop continues until the busy variable becomes zero, indicating that no further work is required.

6. The tty_flip_buffer_push function is called if the loop iterates more than once, indicating that work was done.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch improves the efficiency of the spinlock usage by reducing the time it is held. This can potentially improve the performance of the ulite_isr function.

Considering that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, it can be considered a valid improvement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the mxs platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch changes the type of the 'direction' parameter of the device_prep_dma_cyclic function from dma_data_direction to dma_transfer_direction. This change is in line with the commit 49920bc, which introduced the new enum dma_transfer_direction.

2. In the code snippet, the patch updates the 'direction' parameter in the device_prep_dma_cyclic function call. It changes DMA_TO_DEVICE to DMA_MEM_TO_DEV for the SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK case and DMA_FROM_DEVICE to DMA_DEV_TO_MEM for other cases.

3. The patch also includes an error handling condition where it returns -EINVAL if the slave DMA preparation fails.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is fixing a potential issue with the 'direction' parameter in the ASoC mxs driver. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch can be considered as trivial fixes since they involve updating parameter values.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a suggestion to print a message informing the user about the possibility of using the "pci=realloc" boot parameter to address unassigned PCI device resources. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is more of an informational message for users to try a specific boot parameter.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue or provide a significant improvement. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes sparse warnings in the udl_connector.c file by adding missing static storage class specifiers. These warnings indicate that certain symbols were not declared and suggest making them static. By adding the static specifier, the symbols are properly declared and the warnings are resolved.

Since this patch addresses a real issue (sparse warnings) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || This patch is a trivial fix that replaces the usage of 0 and 1 with the true and false defines for boolean variables in the af9013 driver. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with the alternatives patching on secondary CPUs in the arm64 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description explains that in order to ensure the patched instruction stream is visible to a CPU, that CPU must execute an `isb` instruction after any related cache maintenance has completed. This suggests that without the `isb` instruction, secondary cores may be left in a state where they are executing a mix of old and new code.

2. The patch adds an `isb` instruction following the secondary polling loop in the alternatives patching code.

3. The `isb` instruction is a synchronization barrier that ensures that any instructions following it are fetched from the updated instruction stream. This helps to avoid potential issues caused by executing a mix of old and new code.

4. The patch is signed-off by Will Deacon, who is a recognized contributor to the arm64 architecture code.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect execution on secondary CPUs in the arm64 architecture. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a necessary synchronization barrier. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the driver does not pass the number of tasks to the QM (Queue Manager) init logic. This can cause back-pressure in scenarios requiring many tasks, leading to reduced performance.

2. Impact: The issue described in the patch can potentially result in reduced performance in scenarios where a large number of tasks are required, such as when using max MRs (Memory Regions). This indicates that the bug being fixed is a real and critical issue that affects system performance.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `qed_qm_init_pf` function in the `qed_cxt.c` file. Specifically, it adds the line `params.num_tids = iids.tids;` to pass the number of tasks to the QM init logic.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can impact system performance, and the code changes are directly related to addressing the issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to the addition of a route in IPv6. The patch adds a test to check if the nexthop gateway is a local address before adding the route. This prevents a situation where the route lookup picks the wrong outdev due to the prefix route being added before Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) work is started.

Considering that this patch addresses a specific bug that can lead to incorrect route selection, it can be categorized as a critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a copy/paste error in the code. The change only modifies a single line by correcting the link activation from "B" to "A" for the CSTM (LVDS, link A/B, upper) configuration.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error on the arm64 architecture. Build errors can prevent the kernel from being compiled correctly, which is a critical issue. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a real bug: The boolean variable 'found' is not initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential issues.
2. The bug does not fall under the category of trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by two individuals, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, further validating its credibility.
5. The patch is a simple and straightforward fix that initializes the 'found' variable to false, ensuring proper behavior.

Therefore, considering the criticality of the bug and the validation it has received, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compiler warning related to the pr_debug statement in the iommu_map function. The change modifies the formatting of the pr_debug statement to include explicit casting for the pgsize variable.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions in the MIPS tlbex code. The bug was introduced by commit c5b367835cfc, which assumed a constant offset for certain PTE bits relative to _PAGE_PRESENT. However, this assumption is no longer true for some MIPS32R2 builds due to commit be0c37c985ed, which rearranged the PTE bits.

The patch addresses this issue by using the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask instead of hardcoding values. It fixes the broken offsets on r2 without XPA.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause build errors or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the greybus UART driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the `gb_tty_probe` function by changing the assignment of `gb_tty` to `greybus_set_drvdata(gdev, gb_tty)` to `gdev->gb_tty = gb_tty`. This change ties the UART driver into the greybus core properly.

2. The patch also modifies the `gb_tty_disconnect` function by changing the assignment of `gb_tty` to `greybus_get_drvdata(gdev)` to `gdev->gb_tty`. This change retrieves the UART driver from the greybus core properly.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to tying the UART driver into the greybus core properly. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the LRW cipher implementation in the Linux kernel. The patch defines a constant `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` with a value of 16, which is the fixed block size for LRW. This constant is then used in place of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` throughout the code.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue related to the LRW cipher, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that renames an argument in the mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map function.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds additional fields to be recognized by the WACOM_PEN_FIELD and WACOM_FINGER_FIELD macros in the HID Wacom driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to unprivileged users revealing what is under a mount. The patch checks if the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag is set and if the CL_EXPIRE flag is not set or if the old mount's mnt_expire list is empty. If these conditions are met, the MNT_LOCKED flag is set on the new mount.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a potential security issue by preventing unprivileged users from revealing information under a mount. This can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a quirk addition for the asus-nb-wmi module to fix Wi-Fi functionality on ASUS X75VD laptops. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a quirk for the ASUS X75VD laptop to the asus-nb-wmi module. This indicates that there is a specific issue with Wi-Fi functionality on this laptop model.

2. The patch includes the necessary DMI information to identify the ASUS X75VD laptop.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue with Wi-Fi functionality on the ASUS X75VD laptop, which can be considered a real and critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the pr_fmt() macro in the asymmetric key signature handling code. This change adds a prefix to the print messages for better identification.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses warnings reported by the compiler. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a trivial fix that marks a function as static to address a warning during the build process. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces two new knobs, idgen_retries and idgen_delay, for IPv6 address generation. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. 

The patch modifies the netns_sysctl_ipv6 structure in include/net/netns/ipv6.h to include the new knobs idgen_retries and idgen_delay. It also modifies the addrconf_dad_failure function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c to use the values of idgen_retries and idgen_delay from the net structure instead of using hardcoded values. Similarly, the ipv6_generate_stable_address function in net/ipv6/af_inet6.c also uses the idgen_retries value from the net structure.

Additionally, the patch adds the idgen_retries and idgen_delay knobs to the sysctl table in net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It introduces new knobs for IPv6 address generation, which is not a critical bug or security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to avoid auto-mute or auto-mic of retasked jacks when a jack is retasked as a different direction. It skips the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` and `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` functions in the `hda_generic.c` file.

3. Analysis:
   The patch checks if a pin is retasked as an input or output before performing automute or autoswitch operations. If a pin is retasked as an input, it is skipped in the `detect_jacks` function. Similarly, if a pin is retasked as an output, it is skipped in the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function.

   This patch addresses a specific scenario where retasked jacks should not be counted as the target for automatic jack switching. By avoiding automute or autoswitch in such cases, it prevents potential issues that may arise from incorrect jack detection.

4. Impact:
   The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses a potential issue related to jack detection and retasking, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

5. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it could be considered for inclusion in future non-stable releases or distributions if deemed necessary.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be fixing a build error by adding a missing declaration of the `cmpxchg64` function. Since the error is related to a missing function declaration, it does not seem to fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI driver for touchpads.
2. The issue occurs when a touchpad does not report relative data, causing query 6 to be absent and the address of query 8 to be one less.
3. The patch introduces a calculation to determine the location of query 8 dynamically instead of hardcoding the offset.
4. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
6. The issue being fixed does not fall into the category of build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the correct functioning of touchpads.
7. The patch is focused on improving the accuracy and reliability of touchpad functionality, which can enhance the overall user experience.

Considering these points, the patch can be accepted in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a non-trivial issue and improves the functionality of the HID RMI driver for touchpads.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the application of feature fixups earlier in the code execution flow. While this change may have an impact on MMU management and interrupts, it does not address any specific issue or bug.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported in the zl10353 driver for DVB frontends. The patch changes the calculation of the SNR value from a raw hardware register value to a 0.1 dB scale.

While this change may improve the accuracy of the reported SNR value, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC interrupt controller driver. The patch adds more register documentation, including register names and their corresponding addresses.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. This build error is caused by the 'rspi_of_match' variable being undeclared in the 'rspi_probe' function of the 'spi-rspi.c' file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a build error that occurs when a specific configuration option is not set.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the if condition in line 1238 of the toshiba-acpi driver file.
2. The original condition checks if the sscanf function successfully reads an integer from the buf string and if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1.
3. The modified condition checks if the sscanf function fails to read an integer from the buf string or if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1.
4. The return value of -EINVAL indicates an invalid argument, which is appropriate for this case.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is attempting to fix a potential issue in the toshiba-acpi driver. However, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue without further context. If this issue can lead to a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical problem, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if the issue is not critical or the fix is considered trivial, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Without additional information about the severity and impact of the issue being fixed, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for vring de-allocation in the wil6210 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial change that adds debug prints for vring de-allocation.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves some variables from one file to another. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it contains some trivial changes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to avoid common clk framework warnings. This change is not a trivial fix as it addresses a potential issue with the clock framework.

2. The patch adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_start` function. If either of these calls fails, the function will return the error code and clean up resources before exiting. This is a good practice for error handling.

3. Similarly, the patch adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_stop` function. If either of these calls fails, the function will return the error code and clean up resources before exiting.

4. The patch also adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `usba_udc_probe` function. If the `clk_prepare_enable` call fails, an error message is printed, and the function jumps to the `err_clk_enable` label to clean up resources before exiting.

Based on this analysis, the patch addresses potential issues with the clock framework and adds proper error handling. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __func__ argument from the dev_err function calls in the gdm72xx driver. This change removes the specific instance of the device from the log printout.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to x86/PCI. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch moves the final fixups from __init to __devinit. This change is necessary because final fixups are executed during device enumeration, which may occur after boot if hotplug is supported. Therefore, final fixups cannot be marked as __init.

2. The patch includes a changelog entry, which is a good practice for documenting the changes made.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author, Myron Stowe, and the maintainer, Bjorn Helgaas.

4. The patch modifies the function `quirk_amd_nb_node` in the `arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c` file. This function is responsible for setting correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions.

5. The function `quirk_amd_nb_node` is currently marked as __init, but the patch changes it to __devinit. This change indicates that the function is only used during device initialization and will not be used after that.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a specific issue related to x86/PCI and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the Acer Aspire 5741 model. The patch adds the model to the quirk table in the acer-wmi driver to address a broken ACPI-video backlight control.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to a particular model.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that allows the inclusion of the ".GCC.command.line" section in modules to prevent modpost warnings. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, specifically in the functions `advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma`, `asc_build_req`, and `adv_build_req`. This is important because DMA mapping can fail, and it's necessary to handle such errors.

2. In `advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma`, if the DMA mapping fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns 0. This ensures that the sense buffer is properly mapped and avoids potential issues with data corruption.

3. In `asc_build_req`, if the sense buffer mapping fails, the function returns `ASC_BUSY`. This indicates that the request cannot be built and prevents further processing, avoiding potential issues with data corruption or incorrect behavior.

4. In `asc_build_req`, there is also error checking for mapping the scatter-gather list (sglist). If the mapping fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns `ASC_BUSY`. This ensures that the sglist is properly mapped and avoids potential issues with data corruption or incorrect behavior.

5. In `adv_build_req`, similar error checking is added for mapping the sense buffer and the sglist. If the mapping fails, an error message is printed, statistics are updated, and the function returns `ASC_BUSY`. This ensures proper handling of mapping errors and avoids potential issues with data corruption or incorrect behavior.

6. In `asc_execute_scsi_cmnd`, the return value of `asc_build_req` is checked. If it indicates an error (`ASC_NOERROR`), statistics are updated, and the error is propagated. This ensures that any build errors are properly handled and reported.

Overall, the patch adds necessary error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, which can help prevent potential issues with data corruption or incorrect behavior. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `at76_mod_exit()` function in the `at76c50x-usb.c` file of the wireless driver. The change removes the explicit check for NULL before calling `release_firmware()` in the loop that releases firmware resources.

The reasoning behind this change is that the `release_firmware()` function can handle being passed a NULL pointer gracefully. Therefore, the explicit NULL check before calling the function is unnecessary and can be removed.

This change does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it is not a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. It also does not introduce any new issues or risks. It simply removes redundant code that does not affect the functionality or correctness of the driver.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases as it improves the code by removing unnecessary checks and does not introduce any new problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary line break in the show_scaling_cur_freq() function in the cpufreq.c file.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds soft reset controller support for the STiH415 and includes new softreset lines required for other device tree nodes in the header file. It also defines various softreset values in the reset-controller header file.

However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue that this patch aims to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details about the bug or issue that this patch addresses, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical problem. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if the fix is non-trivial and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix, and any other relevant details, so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of the hash function in the sch_fq.c file.
2. The patch replaces the existing hash_32() function with hash_ptr() for 64-bit architectures.
3. The reason for this change is that the author, Eric Dumazet, initially chose hash_32() because hash_ptr() was not performing well on 64-bit architectures with large amounts of memory.
4. However, Linus Torvalds and George Spelvin have fixed the issues with hash_ptr(), making it a better choice for 64-bit architectures with large memory sizes.
5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and also includes Cc to Hugh Dickins.
6. The patch modifies the fq_classify() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the fq_root array.
7. The patch also modifies the fq_rehash() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the new_array.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a performance issue with the hash function in the sch_fq.c file. While it is not explicitly mentioned that this change fixes a critical bug or security issue, it can be inferred that the patch aims to improve the performance and efficiency of the code on 64-bit architectures with large memory sizes.

Considering that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a performance issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: arche-apb: Don't use gpio after failing to request it." This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to the greybus driver for the arche-apb controller.

2. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from the author, Viresh Kumar, and a reviewed-by line from Vaibhav Hiremath. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review and testing.

3. The patch modifies the `apb_ctrl_init_seq` function in the `arche-apb-ctrl.c` file.

4. The code block being modified checks if a specific GPIO pin (`apb->clk_en_gpio`) is valid and attempts to request it using `devm_gpio_request()`. If the request fails (indicated by a non-zero return value), a warning message is printed.

5. After the request, the code attempts to set the direction of the GPIO pin using `gpio_direction_output()`. However, this is done without checking if the request was successful or not.

6. The patch modifies the code to only set the direction of the GPIO pin if the request was successful. Otherwise, it skips the direction setting and prints a warning message.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where the direction of a GPIO pin is set even if the request for that pin fails. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential issue that could cause "oh, that's not good" behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the fuse filesystem in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the `fuse_file_fallocate()` function in the `fs/fuse/file.c` file.

2. The change replaces the usage of `file->f_inode` with `file_inode(file)`. This change updates the way the `inode` variable is assigned.

3. The `file_inode()` function is a helper function that retrieves the `inode` associated with a given `file` structure. It is a more modern and preferred way of accessing the `inode` compared to the previous method.

4. The patch does not involve any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a potential issue in the `fuse_file_fallocate()` function by using the recommended method to access the `inode` associated with the `file` structure. Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops in the tps65023-regulator.c driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix involving spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Title: "ath9k: Check beaconing mode properly"
   The patch title suggests that the patch aims to improve the beaconing mode check in the ath9k driver.

2. Patch Description:
   The patch description mentions that in MCC (Multiple Concurrent Channels) mode, the TSF (Timing Synchronization Function) of a context needs to be adjusted only if it is a Group Owner/Access Point (GO/AP).

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - Line 260: A new check is added to verify if the previous channel switch should occur after the beacon.
   - If the "switch_after_beacon" flag of the previous channel is not set, the function returns without adjusting the TSF delta.

4. Analysis:
   The patch appears to address a specific issue related to the beaconing mode check in the ath9k driver. It introduces a new check to ensure that the TSF adjustment is only performed for GO/AP contexts in MCC mode. This change seems to be a targeted fix for a specific scenario.

5. Criticality Assessment:
   Based on the provided information, it is not explicitly mentioned whether this patch fixes a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the criticality of the bug being fixed.

6. Triviality Assessment:
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a specific check related to the beaconing mode, which suggests that it is not a trivial change.

Based on the analysis, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further information regarding the criticality of the bug being fixed would be required to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that upgrades the sched_clock interface from 32-bit to 64-bit. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed by the kernel and automatically handle resource cleanup. This helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

2. The patch replaces the manual allocation of memory using kzalloc with devm_kzalloc, which allocates memory that is automatically freed when the device is unregistered. This ensures proper memory management and eliminates the need for explicit memory deallocation.

3. The patch removes the error handling code that frees the allocated memory and removes the thermal group when an error occurs during registration. With the use of devm_ functions, this error handling is no longer necessary as the kernel will handle the cleanup automatically.

4. The patch returns the appropriate error code when an error occurs during registration, ensuring proper error handling.

Overall, this patch improves code readability, reduces code size, and simplifies resource management. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue related to memory allocation and resource cleanup. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary function call. The patch removes the second call to the function "i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()" in the "do_cmd" function of the adl_pci9111 driver.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a lockdep_assert_held() call in the fence_signal_locked() function of the dma-buf/fence.c file. This lockdep_assert_held() call is used to verify that the lock associated with the fence is held when the function is called.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the camellia module to camellia_generic. This change allows optimized assembler implementations to autoload with module-alias.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch modifies the default RSS (Receive Side Scaling) table distribution to prefer close NUMA nodes over far ones. While this change may improve performance in certain scenarios, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the use of typedef ctl_table to struct ctl_table. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new definitions for ATPX in the AMDGPU driver. These definitions include ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, this patch seems to be adding new definitions, which could be considered a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential deadlock issue related to memory reclaim and workqueue flushing. The patch adds a new function called "check_flush_dependency" which verifies that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items when memory reclaim is in progress.

The patch also includes a call to "check_flush_dependency" in the "flush_workqueue" function to ensure that the dependency is checked before flushing the workqueue.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential deadlock issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the FPU type for ColdFire MMU platforms. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple configuration change that sets the FPU type appropriately for the platform.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the incorrect use of `sizeof` in the `rtsx_probe()` function in the `rtsx.c` file of the staging driver for the rts5208 device. The patch replaces `sizeof(dev->chip)` with `sizeof(*dev->chip)` to correctly allocate memory for the `dev->chip` structure.

This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a coding error that could potentially lead to incorrect memory allocation. However, this fix falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a simple correction in the usage of `sizeof`.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `handle_IRQ` with `handle_domain_irq` in the `sa1100_handle_irq` function. This change is aimed at automatically mapping the hardware IRQ number to a virtual IRQ (virq).

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues. However, it is possible that the presence of a phantom LVDS header on the Intel D525MW mainboard could cause confusion or misconfiguration, leading to unexpected behavior. This could be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It specifically adds a DMI entry to address the issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue related to the Intel D525MW mainboard and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, it is important to note that further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers is necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the verbosity of the debugging output in the turbostat tool. The patch modifies the dump_cnt() function to only print the counters that are active, rather than printing all counters regardless of their status.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any security issues, it does improve the usability and readability of the debugging output. However, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only affects the verbosity of the output and does not address any real issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to firmware UCODE_ID_STORAGE in the virtualization environment of the Tonga GPU. The patch allocates a BO (buffer object) and provides the BO's mc address to the hardware to prevent a hang on virtual functions (VFs).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the ftgmac100 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc, addressing a potential corruption issue by shifting struct page pointers out to their own member in struct ftgmac100.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a non-trivial fix that improves the code structure and potentially prevents future issues, but it does not address an immediate critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of the return value of seq_printf and converts it to check seq_has_overflowed instead. This change is in line with the upcoming modification of seq_printf to return void.

2. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve modifying the return statement of seq_printf calls to return seq_has_overflowed.

3. The modified functions in the patch are related to the IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) subsystem, specifically the ipmi_msghandler.c, ipmi_si_intf.c, and ipmi_ssif.c files.

4. The modifications in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or behavior. They simply update the return statement of seq_printf calls to use seq_has_overflowed.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to the use of seq_printf and aligns with the upcoming changes in the seq_printf function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to debug logs in the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch corrects the mixed-up values in the debug logs that report a discrepancy between the expected and received amount of keys.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a non-critical issue related to debug logs.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the ASoC tas5086 codec driver. However, it does not fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the configuration option to enable/disable DMA in the addi-data drivers. This option is currently preventing the conversion of the addi-data drivers to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

2. The patch simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary configuration option and enabling DMA if it is supported by the driver. This improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `comedi_driver_unregister()` function in the staging/comedi/drivers.c file.

2. The change replaces the call to `comedi_dev_from_minor()` with `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver.

3. The purpose of this change is to increment the reference count of the device to prevent it from being removed while it is being checked to see if it is attached to the driver.

4. After the check is performed, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to device removal while it is being checked for attachment to the driver. This could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a generic compatible string for the "hix5hd2" SoC name, which improves the clarity and compatibility of the ethernet driver.

2. The patch updates the "compatible" property to include the generic ethernet driver names "hisilicon,hix5hd2-gemac" and "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-gemac", along with the version strings "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v1" and "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v2". This ensures that the driver is compatible with different versions of the SoC.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch updates the driver's name to "hisi-gemac" to reflect the generic nature of the driver.

5. The patch includes necessary changes in the driver code to support the new compatible strings and version numbers.

Overall, the patch addresses compatibility issues and improves the clarity of the driver. It does not introduce any trivial changes and does not fix any critical bugs or security issues. However, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it enhances the functionality and compatibility of the driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters in the cxgb4 driver. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be adding support for new hardware.

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not fixing a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the onyx and tas codec drivers to use the `module_i2c_driver()` macro. This change makes the code smaller and simpler, but it does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics in the amdgpu driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

From the patch, it seems that the changes are related to enabling and configuring the mailbox functionality for amdgpu_sriov_vf devices. While the patch does not explicitly mention any bug fixes or critical issues, it does introduce new functionality that could potentially improve the stability or performance of the driver for these specific devices.

However, without additional context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op, ensuring that all the callers put the open stateid after use. This step is necessary for the removal of client_mutex.

2. The patch includes a FIXME comment suggesting that the atomic_inc operation should be moved into nfs4_preprocess_seqid_op. This indicates that there might be room for improvement in the code.

3. The patch modifies the nfsd4_open_downgrade function by adding a goto statement to the put_stateid label when certain conditions are met. This change ensures that the stateid is properly released before exiting the function.

4. The patch also modifies the nfsd4_lock function by introducing a new variable open_stp and adding a call to nfs4_put_stid for open_stp when necessary. This change ensures that the stateid is properly released in case of an error.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses some issues related to reference counting and proper stateid release. However, it does not fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a whitespace cleanup and symbol visibility change in the `drivers/crypto/dcp.c` file. It makes the `global_dev` symbol static and changes the visibility of two functions, `dcp_dma_unmap` and `dcp_watchdog`, to static as well.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only contains trivial fixes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the local variable 'status' which is assigned the return value of the function 'lancer_cmd_read_object'. The 'status' variable is not used anywhere else in the code, so removing it does not affect the functionality of the code.

2. The patch also removes the unnecessary check of the 'status' variable. The 'data_read' variable is initialized to 0, and the 'status' variable is not used for any further processing or error handling. Therefore, the check is not necessary and can be safely removed.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to be a valid and non-trivial fix that removes unnecessary code. It does not introduce any new issues and improves the code's readability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the 'data' parameter in the fsnotify() function and related function signatures.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not:

1. The patch fixes a typo by changing "mute_led_nid" to "cap_mute_led_nid" in the line `pinval = snd_hda_codec_get_pin_target(codec, spec->mute_led_nid);`. This indicates that it is a trivial fix, as it only corrects a spelling mistake.

2. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code.

Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that turns off the voltage for thermistors when the ADC conversion is initiated. This change is aimed at saving power. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the iio: pressure: mpl3115 driver. The driver was checking for direct mode but not locking it, which could lead to issues during raw reads.

The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they address a real issue that could potentially cause data corruption or other problems.

The patch also includes proper error handling and returns appropriate error codes when necessary. It ensures that the device is properly locked and unlocked during the read operations.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup of error codes in the hv.c file in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch updates the error code returned when the payload size exceeds the maximum allowed size (HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT). Instead of returning -1, it now returns -EMSGSIZE. This change provides a more specific error code indicating that the payload size is too large.

2. The patch also updates the error code returned when memory allocation fails. Instead of returning -1, it now returns -ENOMEM. This change provides a more specific error code indicating that memory allocation failed.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix real and critical issues by providing more specific error codes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue of dropped characters at close in the sierra USB serial driver. The patch adds the implementation of the `sierra_chars_in_buffer` function, which calculates the number of characters in the buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBS (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue of dropped characters, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver.

2. Instead of using the 'ai_continuous' member, the patch suggests using the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure to determine the value of 'ai_continuous'.

3. The patch modifies the 'usbduxfast_ai_interrupt' function to use the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure instead of 'ai_continuous' to check if the acquisition is continuous.

4. The patch also removes the assignment of 'ai_continuous' in the 'usbduxfast_ai_cmd' function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member and replaces its usage with the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made by the patch seem to be more of a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the libcfs_ioctl() prototype in the staging/lustre code. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

2. The patch is signed-off by Aleksei Fedotov and Acked-by James Simmons, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers.

3. The patch is also signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is a well-known Linux kernel maintainer.

4. The change in the patch modifies the libcfs_ioctl() function prototype by adding the __user annotation to the "arg" parameter. This annotation is used to indicate that the pointer "arg" is expected to be a user-space pointer.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a prototype mismatch in the libcfs_ioctl() function, which could potentially lead to issues such as build errors or data corruption. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers, including a Linux kernel maintainer.
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. It only introduces a local variable `ops` to store `rdev->desc->ops` and uses it in subsequent code. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property in the opal rtc driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the powergating logic in the AMDGPU driver for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU series. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code" and mentions fixing up the powergating logic. This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to power management for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block on CI GPUs.

2. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from Rex Zhu and an ack-by line from Tom St Denis, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch. Additionally, it has a reviewed-by line from Alex Deucher, further indicating that the patch has undergone review.

3. The patch modifies the `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` function in the `ci_dpm.c` file. It adds conditional logic to gate or ungate the UVD block based on the `gate` parameter.

4. Inside the conditional logic, the patch calls `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` to set the powergating state of the UVD block. If `gate` is true, it sets the state to AMD_PG_STATE_GATE, and if `gate` is false, it sets the state to AMD_PG_STATE_UNGATE.

5. After setting the powergating state, the patch calls `ci_update_uvd_dpm` to update the UVD DPM (Dynamic Power Management) based on the `gate` parameter.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to powergating the UVD block on CI GPUs. It introduces conditional logic to properly gate or ungate the UVD block and updates the UVD DPM accordingly. This fix is not a trivial change as it modifies the power management behavior, which can have a significant impact on system stability and performance.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to power management and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames a function in the staging driver for the rtl8192e device, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is simply a renaming of a function to follow the naming convention used in other rtlwifi devices.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `add_pcie_port()` to `dra7xx_add_pcie_port()`. This change is specific to the dra7xx platform and is intended to avoid name collisions in the global namespace.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new feature to the DRM Radeon driver for the Cayman GPU. The patch implements the ability to force a performance level via sysfs. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new feature to the driver.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for encoding the `flags` field in the `ceph_osd_op` structure. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the bug description, severity, and impact on the system. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if this patch has been tested and reviewed by the appropriate maintainers and developers.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the necessary Kconfig entry to enable the MODULE_TX28 configuration option. This option selects various platform-specific features, including MXS_HAVE_PLATFORM_MXS_MMC. This is a necessary step to enable the MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform.

2. The patch defines a new struct mxs_mmc_platform_data named tx28_mmc0_pdata. This structure contains platform-specific data for the MMC device, such as the write-protect GPIO pin and the capabilities of the MMC slot.

3. The patch modifies the tx28_stk5v3_init function to call mx28_add_mxs_mmc with the appropriate arguments, including a pointer to the tx28_mmc0_pdata structure. This function call adds the MMC device to the platform and initializes it with the provided platform data.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds necessary support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. It does not fix a critical bug, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any security issues. Instead, it adds support for a specific hardware feature. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the MIPS PNX8550 platform. The warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization data annotation for the `arcs_cmdline` variable in the `prom_getcmdline()` function.

The patch adds the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function, which suggests that this function is only used during the initialization phase. This annotation helps ensure that the function and its associated data are placed in the appropriate memory section.

Considering the patch addresses a section mismatch warning, which can potentially lead to undefined behavior or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "Staging: hv: Properly handle the error in hv_acpi_init()"
   The patch title suggests that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the "hv_acpi_init()" function within the "staging/hv/vmbus_drv.c" file.

2. Patch Description:
   The patch description is missing, but we can infer its purpose from the code changes.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch modify the "hv_acpi_init()" function. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

   - Line 788: The patch adds error handling code after the "vmbus_bus_init(irq)" function call.
   - Lines 789-791: If the "vmbus_bus_init(irq)" function returns an error (non-zero value), the patch calls "acpi_bus_unregister_driver(&vmbus_acpi_driver)" to properly handle the error.
   - Line 792: The patch returns the error code from "vmbus_bus_init(irq)".

4. Analysis:
   Based on the code changes, it appears that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the "hv_acpi_init()" function. If the "vmbus_bus_init(irq)" function fails, the patch ensures that the "vmbus_acpi_driver" is unregistered and the error code is returned.

   Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the error or its impact on the system. However, if the error being handled is critical and can lead to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, then this patch would be considered appropriate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further analysis and information about the specific error being handled would be required to make a final decision.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Cannot determine.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file. Smatch is a static analysis tool used to detect potential issues in the code. Fixing these warnings improves code quality and reduces the likelihood of bugs.

2. The patch introduces the use of DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST and clamp_val macros to convert values. This ensures that the values are correctly rounded and clamped within the specified range. This change improves accuracy and prevents potential overflow or underflow issues.

3. The patch modifies various macros for consistency and code readability. By making the code easier to understand, it becomes more maintainable and less prone to errors.

4. The patch includes a Signed-off-by line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `list_tail_entry()` with `list_last_entry()` in `mm/zbud.c`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a vifs list to the wl12xx driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a vifs list to keep track of all the vifs associated with the hardware (wl12xx).
   - This change seems to be adding a new feature to the driver rather than fixing a bug.

2. The patch initializes the vifs list in the wl12xx_init_vif_data() function.
   - This initialization seems to be part of the new feature and does not fix any critical bug.

3. The patch adds the wlvif structure to the wlvif_list in the wl1271_op_add_interface() function.
   - This change adds the wlvif structure to the list, which is related to the new feature. It does not fix any critical bug.

4. The patch removes the wlvif structure from the wlvif_list in the __wl1271_op_remove_interface() function.
   - This change removes the wlvif structure from the list, which is related to the new feature. It does not fix any critical bug.

5. The patch initializes the wlvif_list in the wl1271_alloc_hw() function.
   - This initialization seems to be part of the new feature and does not fix any critical bug.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the OMAP4 clock data. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any significant functionality or performance improvement.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch deactivates an interface immediately on enumeration failure. This indicates that there is a problem with the interface enumeration process, which can lead to issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications. It focuses on fixing the actual issue at hand.

3. The patch includes error handling: It properly handles the failure cases by logging error messages and taking appropriate actions. In case of failure to activate or enable the interface, it deactivates the interface and adds it to the interface list.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers: It has been reviewed and signed-off by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only corrects the mask defines for certain registers in the ASoC WM8900 codec driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the ti_abb_init_table() function in the ti-abb-regulator.c file. The patch propagates the error value returned by the function instead of hardcoding a specific error code.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether the issue being fixed falls into one of the critical bug categories mentioned above. Without further context or details about the bug being addressed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.

However, assuming that the bug being fixed is critical and meets the criteria mentioned, and the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unnecessary use of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the ASoC ux500_pcm driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `spin_lock_init()` function call after the error checking for the `kmalloc()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch updates the log messages in the exynos-cpufreq.c file to use the dev_err/info functions instead of pr_err/info functions. This change aims to provide more accurate log messages with the device name included.

2. The patch includes the Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

3. The patch modifies the exynos_cpufreq_scale function by adding a struct device pointer (dev) to the exynos_info structure. This pointer is used to pass the device information to the dev_err calls for logging purposes.

4. The patch also modifies the exynos_cpufreq_probe function by assigning the device pointer (&pdev->dev) to the dev field of the exynos_info structure.

5. Overall, the patch seems to be addressing a logging issue by using the appropriate dev_err/info functions and providing more accurate log messages with the device name included.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it focuses on improving log messages. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the function `clk_get()` to `devm_clk_get()` in the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function. This change suggests that the patch is modifying the clock handling mechanism in the ASoC rcar driver.

2. The `devm_clk_get()` function is a managed version of `clk_get()`, which automatically handles resource management and cleanup. This change improves the code by using the managed version of the clock API.

3. The patch also removes the `clk_put()` call in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the clock resource is now managed by the device model, and manual cleanup is no longer necessary.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a non-trivial fix that improves the code by using the managed version of the clock API and removes unnecessary manual cleanup. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This indicates that these functions are not used outside of this file. Marking them as static improves code readability and helps prevent potential conflicts or unintended usage.

2. The patch also addresses a warning in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file related to missing prototypes for the `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` functions. By marking these functions as static, the warning is resolved.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Rashika Kheria and Josh Triplett, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, as it specifically addresses a warning and marks functions as static.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real issue and does not introduce any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for interrupt mode at the start of `qlcnic_set_channels()`. This check ensures that the function is only executed when the interrupt mode is enabled. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch skips the validation of ring count if they are not going to change. This optimization can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary validations. It does not introduce any trivial fixes.

3. The patch checks if the adapter's flags indicate that MSI-X mode is not enabled. If MSI-X mode is not enabled, it returns an error with an appropriate error message. This check ensures that the function is not executed when MSI-X mode is not supported. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

4. The patch checks if the `drv_sds_rings` value is different from the `rx_count` value. If they are different, it performs ring validation for the `rx_count` value. This ensures that the ring count is validated only when it is going to change. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

5. The patch checks if the `drv_tx_rings` value is different from the `tx_count` value. If they are different, it performs ring validation for the `tx_count` value. This ensures that the ring count is validated only when it is going to change. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

6. The patch removes the validation for RSS/TSS support in INT-x and MSI modes from `qlcnic_validate_rings()`. This change removes the validation for unsupported modes, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior. However, it is not clear from the provided context whether this change is critical or not.

Based on the analysis, the patch seems to address real and critical issues related to ring count validation and interrupt mode. However, without further context or information about the impact of removing the validation for unsupported modes, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.

Therefore, I would lean towards accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK), but I would recommend further review and testing to ensure that the removal of the validation for unsupported modes does not introduce any unintended consequences.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the bcm_sf2 driver in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that it fixes a small piece of code that was left untouched during the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use b53_common. This indicates that there was an oversight in updating this particular code section.

2. The "Fixes" tag references a specific commit (f458995b9ad8) that introduced the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use the core B53 driver. This suggests that the issue being fixed is related to the migration process.

3. The patch modifies the code at line 256 in the bcm_sf2_port_setup() function. It replaces the usage of `priv->port_sts[port].vlan_ctl_mask` with `priv->dev->ports[port].vlan_ctl_mask`. This change ensures that the correct and up-to-date value of the VLAN control bitmask is used.

4. The patch does not include any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the specific issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the bcm_sf2 driver's migration to use the b53_common driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses an issue that could potentially lead to incorrect VLAN control bitmask usage.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a memory leak issue in the docg3 driver.
2. The patch is signed-off by Richard Weinberger and Brian Norris, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the error handling path in the `doc_probe_device` function in the `docg3.c` file.
4. In the original code, there are two occurrences of the `goto nomem3` label, which is used for error handling.
5. The patch replaces the first occurrence of `goto nomem3` with `goto nomem4`.
6. The second occurrence of `goto nomem3` is also replaced with `goto nomem4`.
7. After the label `nomem4`, the patch adds a call to `kfree(docg3->bbt)`, indicating that it frees the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt`.
8. The patch does not introduce any new code or modify any existing code other than the error handling path.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a memory leak issue by properly freeing the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt` in the error handling path. The patch does not introduce any new issues or trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug (memory leak) without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p-jpeg driver. The lack of spin_lock protection can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues when altering device registers. 

The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to the s5p_jpeg_device_run and s5p_jpeg_runtime_resume functions, respectively, to protect the critical sections of code. This ensures that the device registers are accessed safely in a multi-threaded or interrupt-driven environment.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces "x != NULL" with "x" in the if statement condition. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the missing OF module alias information for the ppc4xx_edac platform driver. This fix enables module autoloading for the driver.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix SGL Initialization and posting Pages for Dual Chute". It suggests fixing the initialization of the Scatter-Gather List (SGL) and related page posting for the chute.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by John Soni Jose, Jayamohan Kallickal, and James Bottomley.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the file "drivers/scsi/be2iscsi/be_main.c" and includes the following changes:

   - Line 3450: A loop is added to iterate through the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers. If a ULP is supported, the loop breaks.
   - Line 3453: The page offset calculation is modified to use the ULP number obtained from the loop.
   - Line 3946: Another loop is added to iterate through the ULP numbers. If a ULP is supported, the loop breaks.
   - Line 4013: The ULP number obtained from the loop is used to calculate the ULP ICD (Initial Context Descriptor) start value.
   - Line 4031: The ULP ICD start value is used to set the SGL index.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the initialization of the SGL and posting of pages for the Dual Chute. The changes involve correctly handling the ULP numbers and using the appropriate ULP ICD start value for calculations.

   However, without further context or knowledge about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem being fixed. Additionally, the patch does not explicitly mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

   Therefore, based solely on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. Further investigation and analysis are required to make an informed decision.

   Given the lack of critical bug information and the absence of any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it is recommended to consult with the relevant maintainers and developers for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug or issue. The patch seems to be adding additional conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic. While this may improve the code's flexibility, it does not fix any specific bug or address any critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the regulator_ops structure for the mc13892_sw_regulator_ops. The change involves adding the map_voltage field and assigning it the regulator_map_voltage_ascend function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. The flag is used to determine whether runtime PM should be allowed for a specific device. 

Analyzing the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new member called "allow_runtime_pm" of type bool to the "struct sdhci_pci_fixes" and "struct sdhci_pci_chip" structures. This member is used to indicate whether runtime PM is allowed for a specific device.

2. In the "sdhci_intel_mfd_sd", "sdhci_intel_mfd_sdio", and "sdhci_intel_mfd_emmc" structures, the "allow_runtime_pm" member is set to true, indicating that runtime PM is allowed for these devices.

3. In the "sdhci_pci_probe" function, if the "fixes" member is not NULL, the "quirks" and "allow_runtime_pm" members of the "chip" structure are set based on the values in the "fixes" structure.

4. In the "sdhci_pci_probe" function, if "allow_runtime_pm" is true, the "sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow" function is called to allow runtime PM for the device.

5. In the "sdhci_pci_remove" function, if "allow_runtime_pm" is true, the "sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid" function is called to forbid runtime PM for the device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds support for runtime PM for specific devices in the sdhci-pci driver. It introduces a new flag, "allow_runtime_pm", which is used to control whether runtime PM is allowed for a device. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It appears to be a "trivial" fix that adds a new feature rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: Handle the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring." This suggests that it aims to handle the interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver.

2. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Zhao Yakui and Daniel Vetter, both from Intel. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review and testing.

3. The code changes in the patch modify the gen8_gt_irq_handler() function in the i915_irq.c file.

4. The patch adds support for handling interrupts for both VCS1 and VCS2 rings. Previously, only VCS1 interrupts were handled.

5. The code checks if the master control interrupt includes either GEN8_GT_VCS1_IRQ or GEN8_GT_VCS2_IRQ. If either of these interrupts is present, the code proceeds to handle the interrupt.

6. The patch reads the interrupt status from the appropriate register and checks if there are any pending interrupts for VCS1 or VCS2 rings.

7. If there are pending interrupts for VCS1, the code notifies the corresponding ring.

8. The patch also adds support for handling interrupts for VCS2. If there are pending interrupts for VCS2, the code notifies the corresponding ring.

9. Finally, the patch writes the updated interrupt status back to the register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to handling interrupts for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it may still be suitable for inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel or other development branches for further testing and review.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an uninitialized return variable in the `request_code_segment()` function in the `ft1000_download.c` file of the `ft1000` staging driver.

2. Problem:
   The return variable `status` is used uninitialized if the `boot_case` argument is false.

3. Solution:
   The patch initializes the `status` variable by assigning the return value of the `write_blk_fifo()` function.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential bug where the `status` variable is used uninitialized. This bug could lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect results if the `boot_case` argument is false. By initializing the `status` variable with the return value of `write_blk_fifo()`, the patch ensures that the variable is properly set.

5. Impact:
   This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior. While it is not a critical bug, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

6. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it could be considered for inclusion in future non-stable releases or for backporting to older stable releases if deemed necessary.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates clock IDs in the Rockchip RK3288 clock driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the allocation of requests in the blk-mq-sched module. The patch checks for successful allocation before assigning a tag to the request.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it could potentially address an "oh, that's not good" issue reported by Bart Van Assche during testing of multipath dm.

Considering the nature of the reported issue and the fact that the patch seems to address it correctly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. While it may not meet all the criteria for critical bugs, it appears to fix a specific issue that could impact certain use cases.

Therefore, my analysis is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the naming for the "micd-timeout" device tree property in the extcon-arizona driver to include the time units of milliseconds (-ms).

2. The patch is signed-off by Charles Keepax and Chanwoo Choi.

3. The patch modifies the "wlf,micd-timeout" property to "wlf,micd-timeout-ms" in the device_property_read_u32() function call in the arizona_extcon_device_get_pdata() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a non-trivial fix that updates the naming of a device tree property to include time units. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to delay the initial jack detection by a specified debounce time. This delay allows the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

From the provided patch, it seems that this change is not fixing any critical bug or addressing any security issue. Instead, it appears to be an improvement to the initialization process by introducing a delay. This change does not seem to fall under the criteria of a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a redundant definition for `pgprot_writecombine`. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that hardcodes the clock event rating to 125 for the CMT driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or necessary changes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by a recognized developer, Takashi Iwai, which indicates that it has undergone review and testing.

2. The patch modifies the hda_codec.c file in the sound/pci/hda directory, which suggests that it is related to the High Definition Audio (HDA) subsystem.

3. The patch addresses a specific issue related to memory allocation in the snd_array_new() function. It reallocates memory using krealloc() and sets the __GFP_ZERO flag to zero out the newly allocated memory.

4. The change eliminates the need for an explicit memset() call, which was previously used to zero out the memory. This simplifies the code and reduces the risk of potential bugs or vulnerabilities related to incorrect memory initialization.

5. The patch does not appear to be a trivial fix, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, as it modifies the logic of memory allocation and initialization.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or features but rather improves the existing code by making it more efficient and less error-prone.

Based on these considerations, the patch seems to address a real issue related to memory allocation and initialization in the HDA subsystem. It does not introduce any trivial changes and is signed-off by a recognized developer. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to microcode handling for AMD processors. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a line of code to read the CPUID(1).EAX leaf at the correct CPU and assigns it to the `csig->sig` variable. This change ensures that the correct CPUID value is used for further processing.

2. The `find_equiv_id` function is modified to take the `cpu` parameter, which indicates the CPU for which the equivalent microcode ID needs to be found. This change allows the function to use the correct CPUID value obtained in the previous step.

3. The `get_matching_microcode` function is modified to pass the `cpu` parameter to the `find_equiv_id` function. This ensures that the correct equivalent CPU ID is used for matching microcode patches.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug related to obtaining the correct CPUID value for AMD processors and ensures that the equivalent microcode patch is correctly matched. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes and does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to microcode handling for AMD processors.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to missing return statements in the nl802154_add_llsec_key() function. The patch adds a missing return statement to handle the case where certain attributes are not present, returning -EINVAL. Additionally, it checks for a failure in parsing the key ID and returns -ENOBUFS in that case.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a missing return statement, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used in the msi-available-ranges property. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: Yes, it addresses a bug related to the miscalculation of the MSIR index, which can lead to incorrect behavior when multiple ranges are used.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description whether the bug causes any of these issues. We need to further analyze the code changes to determine if any of these issues are addressed.

3. The patch contains only non-trivial fixes: Yes, the patch includes changes to the code logic and calculation of the MSIR index, which are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. However, further analysis is required to determine if the bug addressed by this patch causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the platform name in the ASoC n810 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific scenario related to the WM8958 detection mode changes in the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the wm8994 codec. 

The patch ensures that DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) is properly synchronized when the detection mode changes. It forces the "CLK_SYS" pin to be enabled or disabled based on the detection mode and then syncs the DAPM state.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or a non-critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a sparse warning. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a warning message related to a specific variant of the ARM architecture.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to clear the hidden CPU state at reset time in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an implementation detail related to system management mode.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It modifies the code to set the `vcpu->arch.hflags` value to 0 during a virtual CPU reset.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the tda998x driver in the DRM subsystem. It modifies the tda998x_irq_thread function to report whether the interrupt was actually handled or not. This change allows for recovery from stuck-IRQ problems, preventing the kernel from locking up.

The patch introduces a new boolean variable called "handled" and initializes it to false. It is then set to true when certain conditions are met, indicating that the interrupt was handled. Finally, the function returns IRQ_RETVAL(handled), which returns IRQ_NONE if the interrupt was not handled, and IRQ_HANDLED if it was.

This change improves the reliability and stability of the tda998x driver by accurately reporting whether the interrupt was handled or not. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of the bug fix and the absence of trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch only converts the code to use the new irq_alloc/free_hwirq interface without any functional change. Additionally, there are no indications of any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues being fixed.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the i2c core to use the common attach/detach functions for PM domains, extending the support to include the generic PM domain as well. This indicates a real and critical bug fix, as it enhances the functionality and compatibility of the i2c bus.

2. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them. This adds credibility to the patch and suggests that it has undergone thorough testing and scrutiny.

3. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve modifying the PM domain attachment and detachment logic, which is a non-trivial change.

4. The patch does not introduce any obvious security vulnerabilities or issues that could lead to data corruption, build errors, oops, hangs, or other critical problems.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the MIPS VPE (Virtual Processing Element) code. It checks if the weak symbol `vpe_run()` is defined or not. If it is not defined (i.e., its value is zero), the patch returns failure early without attempting to load the VPE.

The patch includes a check for `vpe_run` and returns `-ENOEXEC` if it is not defined. This early return avoids unnecessary operations and potential failures when attempting to load the VPE.

The patch also removes the redundant check for `vpe_run` after the `vpe_elfload()` function call. Since `vpe_elfload()` already checks for `vpe_run` and returns a non-negative value, there is no need for the additional check.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue and improves the code's efficiency by avoiding unnecessary operations. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical bug, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary addition to the Linux kernel. The patch adds a function called `dwc2_frame_idx_num_gt` which compares frame indices used for descriptor lists with 64 entries. This function handles the rollover of frame numbers when the maximum index frame number is reached.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference error in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds a NULL check for the 'match' variable before using it. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue that is unlikely to occur. 

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8940: Convert to table based control and DAPM init." It suggests converting the code to use a table-based control and DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) initialization.

2. The patch is signed-off by Mark Brown and has been acknowledged by Charles Keepax and Jonathan Cameron.

3. The patch modifies the "audio_map" variable name to "wm8940_dapm_routes" and updates the corresponding references.

4. The patch removes the "wm8940_add_widgets" function, which adds DAPM widgets and routes, and updates the "wm8940_probe" function to remove the call to "wm8940_add_widgets".

5. The patch updates the "soc_codec_dev_wm8940" structure to include the new control and DAPM information.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is a code refactoring that converts the code to use a table-based control and DAPM initialization. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch seem to be more of a "trivial" nature, involving code organization and naming conventions.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "drm_framebuffer_funcs" argument in two functions: "drm_fb_cma_alloc()" and "drm_fbdev_cma_create_with_funcs()". 

Since this patch only adds the "const" qualifier to function arguments, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

1. The patch aims to address a specific issue related to qdiscs being changed under RTNL protection, potentially causing TX/RX freezes and latency spikes. This indicates a real and critical bug that can impact system performance and stability.

2. The patch introduces the function `rtnl_kfree_skbs()` to queue skbs for deferred freeing. This allows the actual freeing of skbs to occur after RTNL is released, reducing the chances of TX/RX freezes and latency spikes.

3. The patch modifies the `qdisc_reset_queue()` and `__qdisc_reset_queue()` functions to incorporate the new behavior. This ensures that standard qdiscs like pfifo and pfifo_fast have their `reset()` method automatically handled.

4. The patch also introduces the `rtnl_qdisc_drop()` function, which can be used in place of `disc_drop()` when RTNL is held. This provides a more consistent and controlled way of dropping skbs.

5. The patch includes necessary header file modifications and exports the new functions as symbols.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to qdiscs and introduces new functions to handle skb freeing and dropping under RTNL protection. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to properly start and stop the phy device when using phydev in the mv643xx_eth driver. Currently, the driver does not perform these operations, so the patch adds the corresponding calls to port_start/stop.

2. Patch Details:
   - In the port_start function, after initializing the phy hardware, the patch adds the call to phy_start to properly start the phy device.
   - In the mv643xx_eth_stop function, the patch adds a check for the existence of the phy device (mp->phy) and calls phy_stop to properly stop the phy device before freeing resources and resetting the port.

3. Analysis:
   This patch addresses a specific issue related to the proper start and stop of the phy device in the mv643xx_eth driver. It ensures that the phy device is correctly handled during initialization and shutdown, which can prevent potential issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption.

4. Decision:
   Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could lead to issues with the phy device. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more comprehensive analysis may require additional context and testing.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug or issue. The patch only replaces a calculation method with a helper function, which does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which aims to clean up coding style issues in the clk-bcm2835.c file, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only focuses on addressing checkpatch complaints and improving the coding style.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes a code style warning, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, are not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug or issue. The patch only replaces the usage of `call->conn->params.peer` with `call->peer` in multiple places within the code. This change is unlikely to cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a constant from "RSND_GEN2_SRU" to "RSND_GEN2_SCU" in the rcar_snd.h header file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of strncpy() with strlcpy() in the fs/proc/kcore.c file. The purpose of this change is to ensure that NUL termination is properly handled for a string.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames a struct and associated variable, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is related to the staging driver for the National Instruments ATMIO16D device in the Comedi subsystem.

2. The patch aims to improve the aesthetics of the code by using the function `comedi_buf_write_samples()` instead of directly calling `comedi_buf_put()`.

3. The change itself involves adding a new variable `val` and assigning the value read from the device's input/output base address plus the AD_FIFO_REG offset to it.

4. Instead of directly calling `comedi_buf_put()` with the value read, the patch uses `comedi_buf_write_samples()` to add the sample to the async buffer.

5. After adding the sample to the buffer, the patch calls `comedi_handle_events()` to handle any events related to the device.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial change for aesthetics and does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch adds a new function `usable_device()` that checks if a device is available for general use by verifying if the driver link state is active.
2. In the `get_user_context()` function, the patch adds a check using the `usable_device()` function to ensure that only devices with active links are considered for user context allocation.
3. Similarly, in the `find_shared_ctxt()` function, the patch removes the check for device usability, as it is already handled by the `usable_device()` function.

Based on the changes made, it appears that the patch aims to select only devices with active links when looking for or validating a user device. This change ensures that only devices that are currently active are used, which can help avoid potential issues or errors when interacting with inactive devices.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug (ensuring only active devices are used) and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that exports the ioremap_nocache function in the CRIS architecture. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only addresses a coding style issue reported by checkpatch.pl. The change simply moves the opening brace of two function declarations to the next line.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

The patch removes an unnecessary cast on a void pointer in the `r8712_xmit_bh` function. The original code casts the `priv` parameter to `struct _adapter *` using `(struct _adapter *)priv`, while the patch removes the cast and assigns `priv` directly to `struct _adapter *padapter`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary cast. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the code in any significant way.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the function `lp8727_ctrl_switch()` inline.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more comprehensive review may be required before finalizing the decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential bug in the Linux kernel related to IPv6 packet fragmentation. The patch replaces the existing code that checks for a failure in `skb_copy_bits()` with a `BUG_ON()` statement.

The `BUG_ON()` macro is used to assert that a condition should never occur. If the condition evaluates to true, it triggers a kernel panic, which helps in identifying and debugging critical issues.

In this case, the patch replaces the `if` statement with `BUG_ON()` to handle the failure case of `skb_copy_bits()`. This change ensures that if the copy operation fails, it will trigger a kernel panic, indicating a critical issue.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it addresses a potential bug that could lead to data corruption, it is reasonable to conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the `dvb_unregister_device()` function. Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

Considering that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be classified as a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

3. Analysis:
   - The patch adds necessary clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2, which indicates that it is addressing a real and critical bug or issue.
   - The addition of these clock gates is not a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the clock subsystem and adding new clock gate definitions.
   - The patch does not appear to introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.
   - The changes made in the patch seem to be relevant and necessary for proper functioning of the EPIT feature.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug by adding necessary clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to updating the scan response data in the Bluetooth management code. The patch updates the correct variables, `scan_rsp_data_len` and `scan_rsp_data`, instead of mistakenly using the advertising data variables.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a non-critical issue related to Bluetooth management.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real issue: The original code uses pr_warn to print a warning message when failing to register to debugfs or reregistering. The patch replaces pr_warn with netdev_warn, which is a more appropriate function for printing warnings related to network devices.

2. The change does not appear to be trivial: The patch modifies the code logic by replacing pr_warn with netdev_warn. Although it may seem like a simple change, it is not a trivial fix as it involves replacing a generic warning function with a network device-specific warning function.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The change is straightforward and does not introduce any new code complexity or potential bugs.

4. The patch does not contain any unrelated changes: The patch explicitly mentions that one occurrence is left intact as it is unrelated to the net_device. This indicates that the patch focuses only on the necessary changes.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the declaration of the "decon_crtc_ops" structure in the "exynos5433_drm_decon.c" file. This change is aimed at improving code correctness by ensuring that the structure is treated as read-only when passed as an argument to the "exynos_drm_crtc_create" function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the `mask_pos` correctly in the PCI subsystem. The original code incorrectly calculated the value of `mask_pos` based on the `control` and `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` values.

The patch modifies the code to correctly calculate `mask_pos` based on the `control` value. It uses the ternary operator to assign the appropriate value to `mask_pos` depending on whether `control` has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set or not.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a logical error in the code, which can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a version update for the tg3 driver in the Linux kernel.

   The patch is titled "drm/msm: use drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence." It suggests using the function drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane.

2. Patch Details:
   The patch modifies the msm_atomic_commit() function in the msm_atomic.c file. It adds a call to drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane_state. This is done when the plane's framebuffer (fb) changes and is not null.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to improve the handling of fences in the msm_atomic_commit() function. By using drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane(), the patch ensures that the plane_state->fence is not overwritten if the user has already set an explicit fence.

   The patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the usage of a variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT data, which avoids the need to add clock aliases under specific files.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to the return value of efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivarfs file system driver.

2. The bug is related to the incorrect return type used for the bytes variable. It is currently defined as ssize_t (signed), but it should be size_t (unsigned) to avoid potential sign issues.

3. The patch correctly changes the type of the bytes variable to ssize_t and initializes it to 0.

4. The patch handles error conditions properly by setting the bytes variable to the appropriate negative error code (e.g., -EFAULT, -EINVAL) and returning it.

5. The patch also updates the bytes variable to the actual count value before returning it.

6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to newer versions of gcc and variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch addresses the issue by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays directly.

However, based on the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a code improvement or compatibility fix rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" member outside the "mesh_stats" debug group. This change is made because "estab_plinks" is not a statistics member and should not be displayed along with other mesh stat members.

2. The patch adds the "estab_plinks" debugfs attribute to the mesh files. The attribute is added with a mode of 0400, indicating that it is readable only.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making a necessary change to improve the organization of debug information related to mesh statistics. It does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Additionally, the change does not involve any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue. As a result, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to address a sparse warning. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

The patch addresses a potential concurrency issue where multiple threads could access the `free_vbufs` list simultaneously, leading to race conditions and potential data corruption.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential concurrency issue, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it may be suitable for inclusion in the mainline kernel or other development branches to improve the stability and reliability of the virtio-gpu driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix memory leaks in the __il4965_up() function of the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses non-success return paths where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed.

The patch also handles the case where the card is not ready after il4965_prepare_card_hw() and when the card is hardware-rfkilled. In the hardware rfkilled path, the driver enables the rfkill interrupt, and when the card is unrfkilled, the interrupt is raised, leading to a call to il4965_bg_restart(), which in turn calls __il4965_up() and iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() again.

The suggested-by, signed-off-by, and acked-by tags indicate that the patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to memory leaks and incorrect behavior in the iwl4965 driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that eliminates the send buffers in the GSI receive QP. This change does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the usage of the `i_uid` and `i_gid` fields in the `xenfs_make_inode` function in `drivers/xen/xenfs/super.c`. The patch replaces the hardcoded values of 0 with the `GLOBAL_ROOT_UID` and `GLOBAL_ROOT_GID` constants.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds code to re-create the graph walk object as needed to ensure that it is large enough for all entities in the graph. This is done to support pipeline power management in the future.

2. The patch fixes a documentation bug related to a warning message.

3. The patch acquires and releases the graph_mutex lock to ensure exclusive access to the graph walk object.

4. If the current graph walk object is not large enough, the patch initializes a new graph walk object and cleans up the old one.

5. The patch cleans up the graph walk object during media device cleanup.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to graph walk object management and fixes a documentation bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless conditional branch. The change simply assigns the value of `skb` to `napi->skb` without any additional checks. Since `napi->skb` is already NULL, there is no risk of any bad behavior.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a trivial fix as it removes a conditional branch that has no impact on the behavior of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to waiting for a BO (Buffer Object) to become idle after a move in ttm_bo_swapout function in ttm_bo.c.

2. The patch removes the initial wait for the GPU before moving the BO to system cached memory. This change suggests that the initial wait was unnecessary or redundant.

3. The patch introduces a new step to ensure that the BO is idle before proceeding further. This step ensures that any pending operations on the BO are completed before unmap and other operations are performed.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Christian König and Alex Deucher, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to BO handling and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant declarations of functions in the perf/x86/intel/bts driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add support for the AR9580 device in the ath9k driver. However, the patch does not provide any information about the bug it fixes or any potential issues it may introduce.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being addressed, the impact it has on the system, and any potential risks associated with the patch. Without this information, it is not possible to determine whether the patch meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as "Insufficient Information" and recommend further investigation before making a decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: staging: comedi: pcl816: remove 'i8254_osc_base' from boardinfo
   - The patch aims to remove the 'i8254_osc_base' data from the boardinfo structure in the pcl816 driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the struct pcl816_board.
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the boardtypes[] array for the "pcl816" and "pcl814b" board types.
   - The i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function calls are modified to use the constant I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ instead of the board's 'i8254_osc_base' value.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch removes the 'i8254_osc_base' field from the boardinfo structure and the boardtypes[] array for the "pcl816" and "pcl814b" board types.
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is not used elsewhere in the code.
   - The i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function calls are modified to use the constant I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ instead of the board's 'i8254_osc_base' value.
   - The removal of the 'i8254_osc_base' field does not seem to fix any real and critical bug or address any security issue.
   - The changes made by the patch appear to be trivial and do not seem to have a significant impact on the functionality or stability of the driver.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). The changes made by the patch do not fix any critical bug or address any security issue, and they appear to be trivial in nature.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a wait for one vblank before disabling CRCs in the i915 driver. The purpose of this change is to avoid a spurious interrupt warning. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new member `resource` to the `struct drbd_device` in the `drbd_int.h` header file. This member is then assigned a value in the `drbd_create_minor` function in `drbd_main.c` and used in the `drbd_adm_prepare` function in `drbd_nl.c`.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it seems to be a trivial change that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the svcrpc module related to the traversal of the xpt_list during shutdown. The patch introduces new locking mechanisms to ensure proper synchronization.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a locking issue that may not have a significant impact on system stability or security.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a refactoring change that factors out the function `sdhci_set_default_irqs()` from the `sdhci_init()` function in the `sdhci` driver. 

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release, I would recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the leds-pca963x driver. The patch initializes the `led` structure completely, ensuring that all fields are properly initialized and do not contain random stack data.

Although this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it does address an issue that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the driver. Therefore, I would classify this patch as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a non-trivial issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a helper function `dwc3_core_fifo_space` to the `dwc3` USB driver. This helper function is intended to be used for debugging purposes initially, to dump space of different queues and fifos in `dwc3` to debugfs. It is also mentioned that this helper function will be used later to issue remote wakeup when starting a transfer and there is something in a TX FIFO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is primarily adding a helper function for debugging purposes and for future use in issuing remote wakeup.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential security issue. The patch reintroduces a check to disallow world-writable files in sysfs. This check was previously removed when the check was unified into VERIFY_OCTAL_PERMISSIONS().

Considering that the patch addresses a real security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a semicolon. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the values of n, m1, and m2 in the FP register for the gma500 driver. The changes involve subtracting 2 from the values before writing them to the register. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch only changes the return type of the `drm_pci_agp_init` function from `int` to `void`. This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to nf_bridge information in the netfilter bridge module. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a new function `nf_bridge_info_free` that frees the `nf_bridge` information from the `skb` structure.
2. In the `br_nf_push_frag_xmit` function, the `nf_bridge_info_free` function is called before pushing the `skb` for transmission.
3. In the `br_nf_dev_queue_xmit` function, the `nf_bridge_info_free` function is called before pushing the `skb` for transmission. This function is also called when `skb_is_gso` is true or when the `skb` protocol is not `ETH_P_IP`.
4. In the `br_nf_dev_queue_xmit` function, the `nf_bridge_info_free` function is called before pushing the `skb` for transmission. This function is also called when `skb_is_gso` is false and the `skb` protocol is `ETH_P_IP`.
5. The `br_nf_dev_queue_xmit` function is defined differently depending on the availability of `ip_fragment` function.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to freeing the `nf_bridge` information in the netfilter bridge module. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new function and modifies existing code to ensure proper cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to freeing the `nf_bridge` information, which could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the Lustre staging driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes warnings that occur when compiling a 64-bit kernel in the spi-pxa2xx.c file.
2. The warnings are related to pointer-to-integer casts and integer-to-pointer casts of different sizes.
3. The patch replaces the IS_DMA_ALIGNED macro with the IS_ALIGNED macro, using the DMA_ALIGNMENT constant.
4. The patch also modifies the initialization of the null_dma_buf field in the driver_data structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses warnings related to pointer casts and modifies the initialization of a field.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the gk20a_instmem structure in the gk20a.c file of the nouveau driver. It adds a new member, u16 iommu_bit, to store the IOMMU bit specified in the platform data. This change allows the IOMMU bit to be used dynamically instead of being hardcoded to the bit used by current Tegra GPUs.

In the gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu function, the patch replaces the hardcoded bit 34 with the iommu_bit member to clear the IOMMU bit and unmap pages.

Similarly, in the gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu function, the patch replaces the hardcoded bit 34 with the iommu_bit member to set the IOMMU bit and resolve addresses through the IOMMU.

Finally, in the gk20a_instmem_new function, the patch assigns the iommu_bit value from the platform data to the iommu_bit member of the gk20a_instmem structure.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a functional improvement that allows for dynamic usage of the IOMMU bit.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that replaces the module_init and module_exit calls with the module_i2c_driver macro. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the explicit initialization and cleanup functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function callback. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix and therefore it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a memory leak issue that occurs when the adapter fails initialization. This bug can lead to memory exhaustion and potential system instability.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve splitting the memory freeing part of `nvme_free_queue()` into a separate function `nvme_free_queue_mem()` and calling it in the case of initialization failure.

3. The patch improves code readability and maintainability: By splitting the memory freeing part into a separate function, the code becomes more modular and easier to understand. This can help in future code maintenance and debugging.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by a recognized developer: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Matthew Wilcox, an Intel developer. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has been deemed suitable for inclusion.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style warning related to void function return statements. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the function `blkdev_mmap()` as static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the cfg80211 module. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch allows vendor commands that require the WIPHY_VENDOR_CMD_NEED_RUNNING flag to be sent to the NAN (Neighbor Awareness Networking) interface.

2. The patch includes the necessary sign-offs from the authors and maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

3. The code change itself modifies the nl80211_vendor_cmd() function in the nl80211.c file.

4. In the modified function, there is a check to ensure that the wireless device (wdev) is either associated with a network device (netdev) that is running or is in the process of starting a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) connection. The patch adds an additional condition to also allow vendor commands when the wdev is associated with a NAN interface that is started.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to vendor commands and the NAN interface. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new condition to allow vendor commands for the NAN interface. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for getting the BOS (Binary Object Store) descriptor test scenario for USB 3.0 in Test 9 of the usbtest module. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the usbtest module.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a dentry leak issue in the greybus driver's es2.c file. The patch adds a debugfs_remove() call to properly remove the debugfs file, which was previously missing. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a dentry leak issue, which can be categorized as an "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug and does not introduce any trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding stub functions for v_sys, refclk, and unipro resource management in the greybus subsystem. These stub functions are currently not implemented and return 0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be adding placeholder functions that are not yet implemented.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch adds a new function called `edma_cleanupp_vchan` which is responsible for cleaning up and killing the tasklets associated with the DMA channels.

2. In the `edma_remove` function, the `edma_cleanupp_vchan` function is called to ensure that the tasklets are killed before the driver is removed.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a cleanup issue in the `edma` driver. It ensures that the tasklets associated with the DMA channels are properly killed before the driver is removed. While this is an important cleanup, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: fixup FPGA ioremap area"
   - The patch aims to fix an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area on the shmobile bockw board.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch removes the static keyword from the declaration of the `fpga` variable.
   - It adds a call to `iounmap(fpga)` to unmap the FPGA ioremap area.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch appears to fix a specific issue related to the FPGA ioremap area on the shmobile bockw board.
   - It removes the static keyword from the `fpga` variable, which suggests that the variable may need to be accessed or modified by other parts of the code.
   - The addition of `iounmap(fpga)` ensures that the FPGA ioremap area is properly unmapped, preventing potential resource leaks.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the FPGA ioremap area and includes necessary changes to ensure proper resource management.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the AXP20X and AXP22X battery drivers to the MFD cells of the AXP209, AXP221, and AXP223 MFDs. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds functionality to support battery drivers for specific PMICs.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The patch simplifies error paths in drivers that use optional clocks by allowing the NULL or error pointer to be passed unconditionally. This indicates that it fixes a potential problem related to optional clocks.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It focuses on addressing a specific issue related to optional clocks.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: It does not modify any existing functionality or introduce new code. It only adds a check to handle NULL or error pointers in the clk_unprepare() and clk_disable() functions.

4. The patch is signed-off by recognized contributors: The patch is signed-off by Stephen Boyd and Mike Turquette, who are recognized contributors in the Linux kernel development community.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds Skylake stepping Revision IDs definitions. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any significant changes other than adding some definitions.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "ops" member of the "ds2404" structure and the "ds2404_chip_ops" structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix involving spelling changes and whitespace cleanups, which are not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address the issue of not unregistering the connector during component removal in the Exynos HDMI driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a call to `drm_connector_unregister(connector)` in the `hdmi_connector_destroy` function. This ensures that the connector is properly unregistered during component removal.

2. The patch also adds a call to `drm_connector_cleanup(connector)` in the same function. This function is responsible for cleaning up the connector's resources.

3. In the `hdmi_unbind` function, the patch calls `hdmi_connector_destroy` to unregister and clean up the connector before destroying the encoder and cleaning up the connector again using `drm_connector_cleanup`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue by properly unregistering and cleaning up the connector during component removal. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to be focused on fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the OMAP platform's USB OTG events. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch's purpose is to mark the interrupt handler as shared for OMAPs, as OTG events come on the same IRQ and need to be shared with the OTG device driver.

2. The patch is signed-off by Roger Quadros <rogerq@ti.com> and Felipe Balbi <felipe.balbi@linux.intel.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers.

3. In the code snippet, the devm_request_threaded_irq function is used to request the IRQ for the OMAP device. The dwc3_omap_interrupt and dwc3_omap_interrupt_thread functions are specified as the interrupt handlers.

4. The patch modifies the devm_request_threaded_irq call by adding the IRQF_SHARED flag as the last argument. This flag indicates that the interrupt line should be shared with other interrupt handlers.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the OMAP platform's USB OTG events and ensures that the interrupt handler is correctly marked as shared.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch fixes a bug related to the pageflip finish event for interlace mode in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs.

2. Bug Description:
   The bug occurs when checking the top field vsync in interlace mode. The comparison is done between a DMA address converted by start coordinates and a non-converted DMA address. This leads to incorrect pageflip finish event handling.

3. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the "mixer_irq_handler" function in the "exynos_mixer.c" file. It introduces new variables "base" and "shadow" and updates the comparison logic for the DMA addresses.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the bug addressed by this patch does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any critical issue. It appears to be a specific issue related to the pageflip finish event in interlace mode.

5. Conclusion:
   Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough examination may be required for a final decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a flag to indicate that a recovery work was initiated on purpose to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set.

2. The BUG_ON() macro is modified to include an additional condition that checks if the bug_on_recovery flag is set and if the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is not set in the wl->flags bitfield.

3. In the wl1271_op_add_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before initiating the recovery work.

4. In the wl1271_op_remove_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before queuing the recovery work.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary fix to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set. It adds a flag to indicate that the recovery work was initiated intentionally, and modifies the BUG_ON() condition to check for this flag.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a hang or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new sysfs file to show the Latency Tolerance Messaging (LTM) capabilities of USB devices.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, without further context or information about the bug it is addressing, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.).

Please provide more information about the bug and any other relevant details so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch moves the initialization of the `rateinfo` structure to a separate helper function called `rateinfo_init`. This change is done to avoid bloating the main match function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. The patch adds a new function `dso__last_symbol()` to find the last symbol in a DSO (Dynamic Shared Object). While this enhancement may be useful for certain scenarios, it does not address any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that made changes to the ARM shmobile emev2 code. The reason for the revert is that the code changes the flags of the wrong CPUs, which breaks the bootup of secondary CPUs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch should be accepted (ACK) because it fixes a critical bug that causes a bootup issue for secondary CPUs. The issue can be classified as an "oh, that's not good" issue, as it affects the functionality of the system.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which aligns with the requirement for non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The changes made in the patch involve replacing the deprecated "cpus_andnot" function with the recommended "cpumask_andnot" function. This change ensures that the code is updated to use the correct and up-to-date function.

3. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve replacing a deprecated function with the appropriate alternative.

4. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue explicitly. However, it is possible that the deprecated function could have caused issues or inconsistencies in the code, which the patch aims to address.

Based on the above analysis, the patch seems to be a valid and necessary update to address the usage of a deprecated function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the ACPI device ID array in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple code modification that improves code readability and maintainability.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a numeric value with a defined constant. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the nve0_fifo_intr_engine function in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch adds a missing call to nouveau_event_trigger, which triggers an event for the given private data structure.

Since the patch fixes a bug that could potentially cause an issue with event triggering in the nve0_fifo_intr_engine function, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling `schedule_work()`. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:

2. Impact:
   The patch addresses a performance issue by improving the speed of the i2cdetect scan.

3. Bug Severity:
   The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a performance issue, which is not considered critical.

4. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error when the mc138xxx driver is built as a module. The patch exports two symbols, "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt," which were previously undefined. 

However, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses a build error, which is considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a whitespace before a parenthesis, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch warning. The change only modifies the formatting of a log message by adding indentation. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential scheduling issue caused by calling `clk_get_rate()` that might sleep. The patch modifies the driver to cache the rates of all bus clocks at probe time and then only use those cached values.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential scheduling issue that may not have a significant impact on system stability or security.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real issue: The ooblen field in the mtd_oob_ops structure is not being initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior if it is accessed without being properly set.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It is not a spelling change or whitespace cleanup, but rather a necessary initialization fix.

3. The patch is not a security issue: It does not address a security vulnerability, but it does fix a potential bug that could cause issues with data integrity.

4. The patch is not a build error, oops, hang, or data corruption issue: It is a code improvement to ensure proper initialization of the mtd_oob_ops structure.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Brian Norris, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue and improves code quality by properly initializing the mtd_oob_ops structure. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a "line over 80" issue and resolves a "blank line" issue. These types of changes, such as removing comments and adjusting line lengths, are considered cosmetic and do not fix any real or critical bugs.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only fixes the default value of gpio_base when no device tree node exists for a device with CONFIG_OF_GPIO defined. This does not seem to fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the f2fs file system. The patch aims to correctly handle the return value of the update_dent_inode function in the f2fs_rename function.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: It seems that the patch addresses a bug related to the handling of the return value of the update_dent_inode function. While the exact nature of the bug is not explicitly mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that it could lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption if not fixed. Therefore, it satisfies the requirement of fixing a real and critical bug.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the return value handling of the update_dent_inode function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real and critical bug without any trivial changes. However, please note that a more thorough analysis of the codebase and testing is necessary before making a final decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for different MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths. This can be useful for systems that require separate memory regions for transmitting and receiving data.

2. If only one region is specified, it is assumed to be shared between Rx and Tx, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. The patch also assigns the Tx channel to Rx if the MMIO regions are different and Rx is not specified. This ensures that the system can still function with a single channel dealing with both Tx and Rx.

4. The patch modifies the structure `struct mbox_test_device` to include separate `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers for the MMIO regions.

5. The `mbox_test_message_write` function is modified to check if `tx_mmio` and `signal` are not NULL before printing and sending the signal.

6. The `mbox_test_receive_message` function is modified to check if `rx_mmio` is not NULL before copying the received message from the MMIO region to the `rx_buffer`.

7. The `mbox_test_prepare_message` function is modified to check if `tx_mmio` is not NULL before copying the message to the MMIO region.

8. The `mbox_test_probe` function is modified to handle separate MMIO regions for Tx and Rx. It maps the resources to `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers, respectively. If the Rx MMIO region is not specified, it defaults to the Tx MMIO region. Additionally, if Rx is not specified but has a separate Rx MMIO region, the Rx channel is assigned to the Tx channel.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds functionality to support separate Tx and Rx MMIO regions and handles the assignment of channels accordingly. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a line over 80 characters warning detected by the checkpatch.pl script. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the code. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The issue is that the wrong value is being passed as an argument to PTR_ERR(). This can lead to incorrect error handling and potentially cause issues in the code.

2. The bug can cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, passing the wrong value to PTR_ERR() can lead to incorrect error handling, which can potentially result in various issues like crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The patch addresses a specific bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug that can have significant consequences and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is as follows:

Patch Title: ste_dma40: Delete an unnecessary variable initialisation in d40_probe()

Patch Description: The patch removes an unnecessary variable initialization in the d40_probe() function. The variable "res" is eventually set to a resource pointer from a call to the d40_hw_detect_init() function. Therefore, the explicit initialization of "res" at the beginning of the function is unnecessary.

Given the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   No, the patch does not fix a bug. It removes an unnecessary variable initialization, which is not a bug.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does the patch fix a real security issue?
   No, the patch does not address a security issue.

4. Does the patch address an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not address any critical issue.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   Yes, the patch removes an unnecessary variable initialization, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, I would conclude that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not fix a critical bug, address a security issue, or resolve any significant issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue occurs when Q_GETNEXTQUOTA is called for a filesystem with quotas disabled, causing an oops. This bug can lead to unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes the problem: It adds an early check to determine whether the filesystem has quotas enabled. If quotas are not enabled, the function returns -ESRCH, indicating that the requested quota is not found.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on fixing the critical bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues: It does not modify any existing functionality or introduce any new code that could potentially cause regressions or other problems.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a change related to ACPI Power Management Timer (PM Timer) in the ACPICA module. The patch makes the PM Timer optional, as it is already supported in Windows 8 and is expected to be included in ACPI 5.0A.

The change itself does not directly affect Linux because Linux does not rely on the presence of the PM Timer. The patch adds checks to determine if the PM Timer is available and returns an appropriate status if it is not present.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an enhancement or optional feature addition.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the obsolete function `simple_strtoul` with `kstrtoul`. This is a non-trivial fix as it updates the code to use a more strict and modern function.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of why `kstrtoul` is preferred over `simple_strtoul`. It mentions that `kstrtoul` filters some invalid input that `simple_strtoul` accepts.

3. The patch includes proper error handling using the `kstrtoul` function. It checks the return value of `kstrtoul` and returns the error code if it fails.

4. The patch modifies two functions, `max_user_freq_store` and `wakealarm_store`, to use `kstrtoul` instead of `simple_strtoul`. This ensures that the input values are properly validated and avoids potential issues with invalid input.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue with input validation and improves the code by using a more modern function. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an extra variable 'ret' which was shadowing a previous definition. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch increases the timeout for aborting transmission in certain channel conditions. While this may improve the reliability of the transmission, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that only reformats pointer variables in the main.c file to meet kernel coding standards. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the driver from "ohci" to "ohci-da8xx" for consistency with other USB drivers. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the hwmon driver for the LM63 chip. The patch adds information about the LM64 and LM96163 chips, stating that they have separate pins for fan monitoring and alert out, and that fan monitoring is always enabled on the LM64.

Since this patch is only a documentation update and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary iteration and uses the passed argument directly. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing module license to the dwc-xlgmac driver. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a type-safe register accessor macros patch for the drm/nouveau/device driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds privileged register interface accessor macros for reading and writing registers in the nvkm_device structure.

2. These macros use the ioread and iowrite functions to access the registers.

3. The patch also includes a mask macro that performs a read-modify-write operation on a register.

4. The patch does not seem to fix any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It appears to be more of an enhancement or code cleanup.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

If it addresses a critical bug, such as a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it may be considered for inclusion in a stable release. However, if it is a trivial fix, such as a spelling change or whitespace cleanup, it should not be accepted in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need more context or details about the bug or issue this patch is intended to fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and arguments in the function `ced_get_out_buf_space()`. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As a result, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1) The patch fixes two bugs in the __lpc_handle_xmit() function of the lpc_eth driver.

2) The first bug is that it can leak skbs (socket buffers) if TXSTATUS_ERROR is set. This bug can potentially lead to resource leaks and memory issues.

3) The second bug is that it can wake up the txqueue even when no slot was freed. This bug can cause incorrect behavior and potential performance issues.

4) The patch includes the necessary changes to fix both bugs.

5) The patch has been reviewed and tested by Roland Stigge, who reported the issue, and it has also been tested by Kevin Wells.

6) The patch has been signed-off by Eric Dumazet, the author of the patch, and David S. Miller, the maintainer of the drivers/net/ethernet/nxp/lpc_eth.c file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue that can cause functionality problems. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic and adding a conditional check. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes two issues related to the update-qp command in the mlx4_core driver.
2. The first issue is that the bit mask for currently supported driver features (MLX4_UPDATE_QP_SUPPORTED_ATTRS) was defined twice, using both an enum value and a pre-processor define directive. This is incorrect and needs to be fixed.
3. The second issue is that the return value of the mlx4_update_qp() function call from within the SRIOV resource-tracker was wrongly voided down. This means that the return value was not properly handled, which could lead to potential issues.
4. The patch fixes both of these issues by correcting the bit mask definition and properly handling the return value of mlx4_update_qp().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses real and critical bugs in the mlx4_core driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add missing configuration for MBUS windows access protection in the mvneta_conf_mbus_windows function of the mvneta driver.

The patch ensures that the controller state is properly accounted for when deciding whether to freeze the queues, preventing a situation where an 'nvme reset /dev/nvme0' command would block indefinitely.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical issue that can cause a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses an issue related to storing the status of registers in the s390/kvm code. It mentions that the current implementation may save stale versions of the ACRS/FPRS registers because the sie state descriptor does not have fields for these guest registers, and they are simply stored in the host registers. The patch proposes to collect the ACRS/FPRS values before saving them to ensure they are up-to-date.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug that can lead to stale versions of the ACRS/FPRS registers being saved, potentially causing incorrect behavior or data corruption.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the bug can lead to data corruption and potentially impact the behavior of the system.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to register saving.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that can cause a segmentation fault when using the perf probe command with a glob. The bug occurs when add_probe_trace_event() fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob, leading to a segfault. 

The patch ensures that add_probe_trace_event() does not modify tf->ntevs and tf->tevs if the function fails. It also adds error handling to free allocated memory and clear the probe_trace_event in case of failure.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause a segmentation fault, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function in `fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c`. This change ensures that `s_dirty` is reset under the correct mutex.

2. The previous condition is incorrect because it allows omitting the checkpoint when a checkpoint was done followed by all the node pages being written back. This could lead to data corruption or other issues.

3. The patch introduces a new label `out` and a `goto` statement to skip the checkpoint if `s_dirty` is not set. This improves the control flow and ensures that the checkpoint is only performed when necessary.

4. The `unblock_operations` function is called after the checkpoint is completed, indicating that the checkpoint is an important operation that should not be skipped.

5. The `stat_inc_cp_count` function is called to increment the checkpoint count in the statistics, indicating that this is a critical operation.

6. The `mutex_unlock` function is called under the `out` label, ensuring that the mutex is always released before returning from the function.

7. In `fs/f2fs/super.c`, the patch removes the previous condition that checked `s_dirty` and the result of `get_pages` before returning from `f2fs_sync_fs`. This change suggests that the checkpoint should always be performed if `sync` is true.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue with the checkpointing process in the F2FS filesystem, ensuring that the `s_dirty` flag is correctly checked and the checkpoint is performed when necessary. This patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch addresses an issue specific to Access Points (APs) in the mwifiex driver. When an AP is started with WEP security and an external station is connected to it, the data path works correctly. However, if the AP is restarted with WPA/WPA2 security, the station is able to connect but ping fails. The patch aims to fix this issue by removing a redundant check that skips the deletion of WEP keys when the interface type is AP.

2. Impact:
   The issue described in the patch does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of a functional issue where ping fails when an AP is restarted with WPA/WPA2 security. While this issue may be inconvenient, it does not fall under the critical bug category.

3. Patch Analysis:
   The patch itself removes a check that skips the deletion of WEP keys when the interface type is AP. By removing this redundant check, the issue with ping failing after restarting the AP with WPA/WPA2 security is resolved.

4. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The patch aims to mitigate the flood of "kevent may have been dropped" warnings generated by usbnet when something goes wrong. This flood of messages can be overwhelming and does not help in resolving the underlying problem.

2. The issue is critical: The flood of warnings can potentially impact system performance and make it difficult to diagnose the actual problem. By ratelimiting the generation of these warnings, the patch helps to alleviate the impact on system resources.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It directly addresses the issue at hand.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The patch does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially cause regressions or other problems.

5. The patch is signed-off by recognized contributors: The patch is signed-off by Steve Glendinning and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ci13xxx_udc driver. The bug causes bogus data to be sent because the driver assumes that the request has already been mapped. The patch addresses this issue by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that reduces the memory footprint for debugging purposes. The patch removes the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() and replaces it with a kernel helper function printk() to dump up to 64 bytes. The actual size being dumped is only 15 bytes.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses unused return smatch warnings in the tcmu_netlink_event function in drivers/target/target_core_user.c. The warnings indicate that the return values of nla_put_string and nla_put_u32 are not being used.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It only addresses a warning related to unused return values, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a minor cleanup for the FRAC_BITS value in the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. The patch fixes the hardcoded value of FRAC_BITS and replaces it with the round_up() function using the FRAC_BITS macro.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to the S25FL127S nor flash part. The patch adds a wait loop after writing to the configuration register to ensure that the flash finishes its work before any further accesses are made. This is important because failure to wait for the flash to finish its work could lead to rootfs mounting failures and potential filesystem corruption.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical issue that can cause data corruption and system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch fixes a warning in the of_free_opp_table() function.

2. Purpose: The patch aims to prevent a warning from being triggered when OPP (Operating Performance Points) are not defined for a device. It also handles the case where an invalid device is passed to the function, preventing a crash in dev_name().

3. Code Changes: The code changes involve modifying the error handling logic in the of_free_opp_table() function.

4. Analysis:
   a. The patch addresses a warning that is triggered when OPP is not defined for a device. This warning is not critical and does not indicate a real bug or issue.
   b. The patch also handles the case where an invalid device is passed to the function, preventing a potential crash. This is a valid fix for a potential issue.

Based on the criteria provided, the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the fix includes a trivial change to prevent a warning. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to interrupt routing for GEN9 hardware in the drm/i915 driver. The patch ensures that RPS interrupts are correctly routed to the CPU instead of the GT. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a relatively minor fix related to interrupt routing.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `btrfs_init_test_fs()` function. The patch ensures that a negative error code is returned from the `kern_mount()` error handling case instead of 0, which is set by `register_filesystem`. This change is consistent with the error handling approach used elsewhere in the function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that improves error handling consistency.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in a Linux -stable release (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the ratelimit code. The bug occurs when the ratelimit interval is set using the rs->interval parameter. In this case, the current code sets rs->begin to 0, which leads to improper suppression. The next ratelimit call will set rs->begin to the current jiffies value, causing the time interval check to always be false. As a result, rs->printed will not be initialized correctly, and ratelimit may return 0 even if enough time has passed.

The patch fixes this issue by setting rs->begin to jiffies instead of 0 when the interval is passed. This ensures that the interval is reset properly, allowing for correct suppression and initialization of rs->printed.

The provided test case demonstrates the bug and shows that suppression occurs even with a 3-second sleep. After applying the patch, the suppression should work correctly, and the "ratelimit test count" messages should be printed at the expected intervals.

Overall, the patch fixes a real bug that affects the functionality of the ratelimit code, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

   b. In net/ipv6/udp.c:
      - Line 529: The patch modifies the code to skip reporting ICMPv6 redirects to user space by adding a "goto out" statement instead of executing the subsequent code.

3. Analysis of Impact:
   - The patch prevents ICMP and ICMPv6 redirects from being reported to user space.
   - ICMP redirects are not considered error conditions and should not affect the socket.
   - By skipping the reporting of redirects, the patch ensures that the error handler does not interfere with the socket.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - However, it addresses an issue related to reporting ICMP and ICMPv6 redirects, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the RGMII_MODE_EN bit in the bcmgenet driver. The patch correctly updates the value of RGMII_MODE_EN from 0 to 6, which is necessary for newer GENET controllers to enable their RGMII data-pad.

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the `max_nr_stripes` variable in the `md/raid5` driver. The bug causes a potential issue when `max_nr_stripes` reaches zero, which should not be allowed. The patch adds a test to ensure that `max_nr_stripes` remains above `min_nr_stripes` and uses a mask instead of a modulo operation to ensure the validity of the `hash` variable.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that the ADS7846 regulator is disabled twice in a row in the ads7846_remove() function, and the valid disable call is in ads7846_disable(). This indicates a redundant call to regulator_disable().

2. The redundant call to regulator_disable() causes a warning about unbalanced disables when removing the ads7846 module. The warning message suggests that the regulator is being disabled more times than it is being enabled, leading to an unbalanced state.

3. The warning message includes a stack trace, indicating that the issue is causing a problem in the code execution flow.

4. The patch removes the redundant regulator_disable() call from the ads7846_remove() function, which resolves the warning about unbalanced disables.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, the patch fixes a real issue that causes a warning and an unbalanced state. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential problem in the code execution flow. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific quirk for the Acer Aspire 5734Z machine to invert the panel backlight brightness value. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific behavior for a particular machine model.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the given criteria, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Telit LE910 V2 mobile broadband card in the cdc_ncm driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new entry for the Telit LE910 V2 device in the `cdc_devs` array, which is used for device identification. This is done by specifying the USB vendor and product IDs, USB class, CDC subclass, and protocol. This step is necessary to ensure that the driver recognizes the Telit LE910 V2 device correctly.

2. The `driver_info` field for the Telit LE910 V2 entry is set to the address of the `wwan_noarp_info` struct. This suggests that the Telit LE910 V2 device does not support ARP and requires specific handling in the driver.

3. The patch includes the necessary information for the patch authorship and review.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding support for a specific mobile broadband card and ensuring that it uses the appropriate handling for devices without ARP capabilities. This does not appear to fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

It states that with a low-frequency SYSCLK and a fast I2C clock, register synchronization may occasionally take too long to take effect, causing I/O issues. Disabling synchronization is suggested to avoid any issues.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function in `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.c` and adds a new variable `sync` to control register synchronization. It sets `sync` to the value of `WM8996_REG_SYNC` (0x8000) initially, and then updates it to 0 when the clock rate is 32000 or 32768.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch aims to address potential I/O issues caused by register synchronization delays when using a low-frequency SYSCLK with a fast I2C clock. By disabling synchronization in these specific cases, it attempts to avoid any negative impact on I/O operations.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   Based on the provided information, the patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses a potential I/O issue that could arise in specific scenarios. While it may not fall under the "critical" category, it can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current code in the paging_init() function fails to detect unsupported highmem due to dcache aliasing, leading to potential coherency issues or triggering a BUG_ON in flush_kernel_dcache_page().

2. The patch fixes the bug by running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(), ensuring that the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro evaluates correctly and the unsupported highmem case is detected successfully.

3. The patch also resolves an additional issue: mem_init_free_highmem() attempts to free all highmem pages, even though they are not being used and do not have valid page structs. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception. The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates to true, avoiding the invalid pointer dereference.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone peer review and testing.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to memory errors on hugepages in the hugetlbfs filesystem. The bug causes a VM_BUG_ON error in get_page() when affected processes try to access the error hugepage. The patch aims to fix this issue by adding a swap entry check in the follow_hugetlb_page() function.

The patch description explains that the bug occurs because the coredump-related code doesn't recognize the "hugepage hwpoison entry" that replaces a pmd entry when a memory error occurs on a hugepage. This results in follow_hugetlb_page() returning the wrong page from a given address.

The patch's expected behavior is outlined, indicating that it should handle different scenarios correctly, such as skipping allocation for absent pages, calling hugetlb_fault() for non-hwpoisoned pages, and properly handling hwpoisoned pages.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a thorough code review and testing should be conducted to ensure the patch's correctness and effectiveness.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

6. The patch ensures that the benchmark functions are called with the necessary reservation object, preventing crashes caused by invalid object usage.
7. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these points, the patch addresses a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a possible hang due to a race condition on exit in the dm crypt module. The race condition occurs when a kernel thread is terminated while another CPU is executing __set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) and spin_unlock_irq(&cc->write_thread_wait.lock). This can lead to the process being stuck and never terminating.

The patch introduces a new flag, DM_CRYPT_EXIT_THREAD, to signal the kernel thread to exit. The flag is set and tested while holding cc->write_thread_wait.lock, ensuring there is no racy access to the flag. Additionally, the patch removes an unnecessary set_task_state(current, TASK_RUNNING) following the schedule() call.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, and it does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description states that after a tx attempt, an A-MPDU subframe can still have fi->retries at 0 if the retry count wasn't incremented due to powersave. This indicates a potential issue with tracking the retry count correctly.

2. The patch addresses this issue by clearing the sequence number from the pending frame bitmap when draining the tid queue.

3. The patch also removes the condition `if (fi->retries)` which previously checked if the retry count was non-zero before calling `ath_tx_update_baw()`. This suggests that the fix is not specific to the retry count being non-zero and should be applied regardless.

4. The `ath_tx_complete_buf()` function is called to complete the buffer transmission.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to be a necessary and appropriate fix for the identified issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential buffer overflow issue in the HFS file system. The patch adds a sanity check for the file name length and limits it to HFS_NAMELEN if it exceeds that value.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a resource management issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver. The patch aims to address a memory leak by reinitializing descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume, instead of freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or hangs. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for enabling the passing of probe requests and beacons from foreign APs in AP mode and GO mode. This is necessary for setting the ht protection IE properly. The patch also includes the same filters for GO mode, which were likely missing by mistake.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm in the TCP implementation. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause performance issues and data delivery problems. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged. The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require calling prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical.

2. The original commit mentioned that preventing waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates, but it suggests that there are better ways to fix this issue.

3. The patch has been signed-off by Maarten Lankhorst and Acked-by Laurent Pinchart, indicating that it has undergone review and received approval from other developers.

4. The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to atomic drivers and framebuffer changes. It has been reviewed and approved by other developers, and it does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting the commit is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" at shutdown or driver unload time.

Given that the patch is reverting a previous implementation and the reason provided for the revert is a race condition, it suggests that the previous implementation was causing issues and may have been unstable. Reverting the commit is a reasonable action to address the problem.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open.

2. The patch addresses a specific scenario where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

3. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

4. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to take the synack_stamp as a parameter instead of using tp->lsndtime.

5. If synack_stamp is available and there are no total retransmissions, the patch calculates the sequence RTT based on the difference between tcp_time_stamp and synack_stamp.

6. The patch introduces a new condition to check if tp->srtt is not set, indicating that the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the (Fast Open'd) data packets sent in SYN_RECV. In this case, the smooth RTT computed in tcp_ack() is used as the SYNACK RTT.

7. The patch is applied in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function, where synack_stamp is set based on the request_sock or tp->lsndtime, depending on the scenario.

8. Finally, the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function is called with the appropriate synack_stamp value.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific scenario related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and improves the accuracy of the RTT measurement. It does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes or non-critical changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a reject for MPC5121 if an input-only pin is requested to be output. This is done to comply with the reference manual (18.3.1.1). This indicates that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug, as it prevents potential issues with input-only pins being set as output.

2. The patch also includes a rewrite of the mach-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which is a good improvement for code readability and maintainability. However, this is considered a trivial fix and does not address a critical bug.

3. The patch includes a new function, `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out`, which checks if the requested GPIO pin is within the valid range for MPC5121. If the pin is outside the range, it returns an error. This is a valid fix for preventing incorrect pin configuration and can be considered a real and critical bug fix.

4. The `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function is modified to use the new `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` function for the `direction_output` callback if the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc5121-gpio". This ensures that the correct function is used for MPC5121 devices, addressing the bug mentioned earlier.

Based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to incorrect pin configuration for MPC5121 devices.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm (memory management) in the Nouveau DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a particular resource, and it avoids the need to add checks for the mm's existence throughout the code.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve conditional logic to handle zero-sized mm creation.

3. The patch does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption: The changes made in the patch do not appear to introduce any new issues that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

4. The patch does not address a real security issue: The patch does not mention or address any security-related concerns or vulnerabilities.

5. The patch does not fix any "oh, that's not good" issue: The patch does not mention or address any critical issues that could cause significant problems or impact system stability.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary improvement to the Nouveau DRM driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a real and critical bug related to NVMe-oF queue size. The bug can cause a deadlock and is indicated by the error message "nvme_rdma_post_send failed with error code -12". 

The patch modifies the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth, removing a magic define and introducing a new function `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit` to calculate the signaling limit based on the queue size. This change ensures that IB completions are sent waiting for the appropriate queue depth, preventing the send queue from filling up.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the desired behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It modifies the scheduling behavior of the task, which can have a significant impact on the system's behavior.

3. The patch does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a straightforward code improvement that enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The commit 7d32cdef5356 caused a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver. This is a critical issue that can lead to system instability or crashes.

2. The patch fixes the bug: It adds a validation check for the "musb" pointer before calling the "usb_phy_set_suspend" function. This ensures that the function is only called when "musb" is not NULL, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on fixing the critical bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged: It has been reviewed and acknowledged by Linus Walleij, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not getting out of idle when HDMI is enabled. The patch introduces a temporary hack by adding a call to `dss_runtime_get()` before calling `pm_runtime_get_sync()` for the HDMI platform device. It also adds a corresponding call to `dss_runtime_put()` in `hdmi_runtime_put()`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, it addresses an issue where the DSS clock domain fails to transition from idle to active state, causing HDMI not to work when it's the default display.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the bug affects the functionality of HDMI, which can be considered a critical issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch introduces a specific workaround to address the issue.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes. However, it is important to note that the patch is described as a temporary hack, and a correct fix is mentioned for future modifications to the DSS related hwmod's mainclks and changes in how optional clocks are handled in the DSS driver. Therefore, it would be advisable to work on a proper fix for the issue in the long term.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a build error in the s3c2410_udc driver. The error is caused by passing the address of a bit-field 'maxpacket' instead of its value to the 'usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit' function.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves a simple change in passing the value instead of the address.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that causes a crash. The crash is a general protection fault, which indicates a serious issue. The patch modifies the blk_exit_rl() function to take a reference on struct request_queue, ensuring that the memory allocated for struct request_queue stays around until all blk_exit_rl() calls have finished.

The patch also includes the Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit. It has been Acked-by Tejun Heo, and reviewed by Hannes Reinecke and Christoph Hellwig.

Considering the nature of the bug and the changes made in the patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a critical issue and has received positive reviews and acknowledgments from relevant individuals.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt enable code in the cavium-octeon MMC driver. The patch description explains that on some OCTEON SoCs with CIU3, there is a diagnostic register at the same address as the enable register, causing interrupts to fire immediately and breaking the driver. The patch suggests not touching this register on these SoCs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause the driver to break. It does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a hang issue related to direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN. The patch ensures that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag is set and the i_aiodio_unwritten counter is increased simultaneously, as ext4_end_io_nolock clears the flag and decreases the counter at the same time.

The patch also includes additional defensive checks to prevent potential issues in the future. It checks if the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag is already set before setting it again and increments the i_aiodio_unwritten counter accordingly.

Considering the patch addresses a hang issue and includes necessary checks and counter increments, it appears to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to prevent a lockdep warning in the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function in the IB/ipoib driver.

2. The lockdep warning indicates a possible recursive locking scenario, where the same lock (&priv->vlan_rwsem) is acquired twice by the same task (kworker/u20:2/261).

3. The patch proposes using the down_read_nested function instead of down_read to prevent the lockdep warning.

4. The down_read_nested function allows nested read locks to be acquired without triggering the lockdep warning.

5. The __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function is called recursively on child devices, and the lockdep warning is triggered when acquiring the vlan_rwsem lock.

6. The patch modifies the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function to pass an additional parameter, nesting, to track the nesting level of the lock acquisition.

7. The patch also modifies the calls to __ipoib_ib_dev_flush in the ipoib_ib_dev_flush_light, ipoib_ib_dev_flush_normal, and ipoib_ib_dev_flush_heavy functions to pass the nesting level as 0.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a real issue by preventing a lockdep warning that indicates a possible recursive locking scenario. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any new issues.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the btrfs file system when read_tree_block() fails. This bug can lead to an oops and potentially cause system instability or data corruption.

The patch sets the tree_root->node to NULL when read_tree_block() fails, preventing the subsequent code from triggering the error. This change ensures that the error handling code runs correctly.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI-E transport "inta" race in the iwlwifi driver. The bug causes interrupts to be missed if a reset occurs after other interrupt reasons have already been added to the variable. This bug could potentially lead to random command timeouts.

The patch addresses the issue by resetting the "trans_pcie->inta" variable after releasing the spinlock, ensuring that interrupts are not missed. The patch also includes a comment explaining the bug and how it was discovered.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can impact system stability and performance, and it does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized memory access issue when writing to oprofilefs on the s390 architecture. The patch checks the return value of the oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() function and returns an error if the value is less than or equal to zero.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sctp_diag module in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the condition in the sctp_ep_dump function, specifically the check for the idiag_states flag. Previously, the condition checked if the idiag_states flag had any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN, and if the endpoint had any associations. The patch changes this condition to check if the idiag_states flag does not have the TCPF_LISTEN flag set and if the endpoint has any associations.

2. The patch also modifies the condition in the sctp_diag_dump function, specifically the check for the idiag_states flag. Previously, the condition checked if the idiag_states flag did not have any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN. The patch changes this condition to check if the idiag_states flag does not have the TCPF_LISTEN or TCPF_CLOSE flags set.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a bug related to the handling of the idiag_states flag in the sctp_diag module. It ensures that the flag is correctly checked to determine whether an endpoint should be included in the diagnostic dump. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the values of LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 in include/linux/poison.h. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is simply adjusting the values of poison pointers to be smaller.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the previous fix accidentally modified the loop condition in too many places while fixing a real bug. This indicates that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug.

2. The analysis further clarifies that the previous fix was correct for the dual_emac mode section but incorrect for the switch mode section. The loop condition needs to be put back in the switch mode section to fix it.

3. The comment added to the code clearly points out the intent and avoids future confusion. Additionally, a comment that previously said the opposite of what was happening has been fixed.

4. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone review and approval.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning generated by gcc >= 7. The warning is related to a potential implicit fall through in the code. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. 

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an issue where the `sock_tx_timestamp()` function in `packet_snd()` does not work correctly when the `sendto` syscall is used without a `msg_control` buffer. This issue is caused by the `socks.tsflags` being set to 0. The patch sets `socks.tsflags` to `sk->sk_tsflags` as the default value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a specific scenario where the `sendto` syscall is used without a `msg_control` buffer.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PFMF instruction handler in the s390 architecture. The patch attempts a copy-on-write (COW) operation on read-only pages before continuing and bails out in case of errors. This addresses a potential issue where the storage key is blindly written even if the page is mapped as read-only in the host.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It addresses a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the analysis suggests that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change in the patch is to remove the negation operator (!) before the call to `ti->type->iterate_devices()`. This change would cause the function `dm_table_supports_write_same()` to return false if `device_not_write_same_capable()` returns true.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug, a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` to clear the RWC (Read/Write Clear) bit in the PORTSC (Port Status and Control) register.

2. The function `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` checks if the RWC bit is set in the PORTSC register. If it is set, the function clears the RWC bit and updates the register.

3. The patch modifies the `xhci_bus_resume()` function in `xhci-hub.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC (Port Link Control) bit in the PORTSC register.

4. The patch also modifies the `handle_port_status()` function in `xhci-ring.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC bit in the PORTSC register.

5. The patch adds the declaration of the `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function in `xhci.h`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to use it. The purpose of the patch is to clear the RWC and PLC bits in the PORTSC register when necessary.

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to the linear region size of a 39-bit VA kernel. The patch sets the MAX_MEMBLOCK_ADDR value accordingly to ensure that the memory that cannot be mapped is clipped before being installed into the memblock memory table.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The wrong pointer is being passed for raw data sanity checking when parsing a sample event, leading to an invalid event and causing perf record to hang.

2. The issue is critical: It causes a hang in the perf record command, which indicates a functional problem that needs to be fixed.

3. The fix is straightforward: The patch corrects the pointer used for raw data sanity checking by using the proper pointer to the raw data instead of the 'u' union.

4. The patch has been reviewed by multiple individuals, including David Ahern, who has provided a Reviewed-by tag, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch has been tested by the submitter and confirmed to fix the issue in their setup.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical issue and prevent the hang in perf record.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to resetting the HCR (Hypervisor Configuration Register) on each vCPU when resetting the vCPU in the ARM and ARM64 architectures. The patch ensures that the necessary cache maintenance operations are performed when faulting in pages with the guest MMU off, which is crucial for the reboot of VMs.

The patch includes changes in the following files:
- arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h
- arch/arm/kvm/arm.c
- arch/arm/kvm/guest.c
- arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_emulate.h
- arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c

The changes involve adding a new function `vcpu_reset_hcr` to reset the HCR value and calling it in the `kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_vcpu_init` function in `arch/arm/kvm/arm.c` and `arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c`. Additionally, the `kvm_arch_vcpu_setup` function in `arch/arm/kvm/guest.c` and `arch/arm64/kvm/guest.c` no longer directly set the HCR value.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to cache maintenance operations and guest MMU behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an API misuse in the intel_idle driver. The patch replaces the usage of `smp_call_function` with `on_each_cpu` to ensure that all CPUs execute a specific function in the intel_idle driver.

This patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a code improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the USB gadget driver. The patch checks if dma_pool_alloc() fails and properly handles the failure by freeing the allocated bd_table before jumping to the fail label. This prevents a memory leak in the case of allocation failure.

Considering that memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability, this patch addresses a real and critical bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem: The kernel hangs during bootup on Little Endian (LE) operating systems when both IMA and VTPM are enabled.

2. Cause: The hang occurs because IMA calls tpm_pcr_read(), which triggers the execution of tpm_ibmvtpm_send() and tpm_ibmtpm_recv(). It was found that tpm_ibmtpm_recv was hanging.

3. Resolution: The patch fixes the hang by addressing the issue in tpm_ibmtpm_recv. The problem was caused by tpm_ibmvtpm_send sending a CRQ message that didn't make sense to phype due to Endianness. The patch ensures that the CRQ is correctly converted for Little Endian systems.

4. Testing: The patch has been tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in the kernel configuration on both Big Endian (BE) and Little Endian (LE) PowerPC64 LPARs. The testing covered the CRQ and TPM command code paths in vtpm.

5. Patch Details: The patch modifies the tpm_ibmvtpm_send() function in tpm_ibmvtpm.c and the ibmvtpm_crq structure in tpm_ibmvtpm.h. It replaces the usage of u64 with __be64 for the CRQ word variable and converts the len and data fields to big-endian format using appropriate conversion functions.

6. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Joy Latten, Peter Huewe, and Ashley Lai. It is also CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list.

Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a hang on Little Endian systems when IMA and VTPM are enabled. It also includes proper testing and sign-offs. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

   - This change ensures that the offset is correctly initialized after the necessary checks have been performed.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug in the cifs_iovec_write function. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to be a valid solution to the problem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in the NFC FDP driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a check for the "phy" pointer before dereferencing it. This is a good practice to avoid NULL pointer dereference bugs.

2. If the "phy" pointer is NULL or the IRQ does not match the expected value, the function returns IRQ_NONE. This ensures that the function does not proceed with further operations if the conditions are not met.

3. The "client" variable is assigned the value of "phy->i2c_dev" after the NULL pointer check. This assignment is safe since "phy" is guaranteed to be non-NULL at this point.

4. The debug information is printed using "dev_dbg" after the NULL pointer check. This helps in identifying the specific location of the IRQ handler.

5. The function then proceeds with reading data using "fdp_nci_i2c_read" and handles the return value accordingly.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug by preventing a NULL pointer dereference. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or system instability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix a bug in the qlcnic driver related to mailbox completion handling during a spurious interrupt. It addresses a situation where the driver mistakenly treats a spurious mailbox interrupt as a valid mailbox completion interrupt, leading to premature completion of the next mailbox request. The patch adds a check to ignore the spurious interrupt and includes a stats counter to record this condition.

2. Impact:
   The bug addressed by the patch does not cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue where the driver incorrectly handles spurious interrupts, potentially affecting the reliability and performance of the qlcnic driver.

3. Patch Analysis:
   The patch modifies the qlcnic_83xx_handle_aen() function to check the response status of the mailbox before notifying the mailbox response. If the response status is QLC_83XX_MBX_RESPONSE_ARRIVED, indicating a spurious interrupt, the patch increments the mbx_spurious_intr counter in the adapter's stats structure. This change ensures that spurious interrupts are properly handled and accounted for.

4. Patch Size:
   The patch is relatively small, with changes made to two files: qlcnic_83xx_hw.c and qlcnic_ethtool.c. The modifications are focused on adding the necessary checks and updating the stats structure.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the bug addressed is not critical, it does fix an issue that could impact the reliability and performance of the qlcnic driver. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and includes proper documentation and sign-offs from the authors.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the devfreq_add_device() function, which is responsible for adding a devfreq instance.
2. The bug occurs when the find_devfreq_governor() function returns an error, causing devfreq_add_device() to fail in adding the devfreq instance.
3. The patch handles this scenario by checking if the governor is an error using IS_ERR(governor). If it is an error, it logs an error message and returns the error code.
4. The patch then assigns the governor to the devfreq instance and proceeds with the event_handler() call.
5. If the event_handler() call fails, it logs an error message.

Based on this analysis, the patch fixes a real bug that could lead to the failure of adding a devfreq instance. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue that could potentially cause system instability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) on SandyBridge due to performance issues and frequent lockups. The patch checks the generation of the Intel graphics device and disables FBC if the generation is less than or equal to 6.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch addresses a performance issue and frequent lockups caused by enabling FBC on SandyBridge. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a security issue, the performance degradation and lockups can be considered as "oh, that's not good" issues.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical issue that affects the functionality and stability of the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to manual sequencing activation and deactivation in L2TPv2. The patch ensures that the correct amount of data is pushed for the L2TP header by updating the hdr_len session field.

It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "iio: adc: at91: don't use the last converted data register." It addresses an issue where the last converted data register can contain touchscreen relative values if a conversion is requested on another channel while the touchscreen mode is enabled. This can lead to incorrect data being read from the ADC_LCD register.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the at91_adc_read_raw() function in the at91_adc.c file. It introduces a new variable "chnb" to store the channel number and uses it to read the channel data register instead of the last converted data register.

3. Analysis:
   The patch aims to fix a potential issue where the last converted data register may contain incorrect data due to the temporal constraint of reading the ADC_LCD register. By reading the channel data register instead, the patch eliminates this constraint and ensures accurate data retrieval.

   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue that could potentially lead to incorrect data being read from the ADC_LCD register.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that could result in data corruption and does not contain any trivial changes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the Btrfs file system. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch addresses a problem in the backref code of Btrfs, where nodes were being checked along with leaves when populating extent item entries. This could lead to unexpected issues, especially when random_memory matches disk_bytenr. The patch aims to fix this problem.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the "find_parent_nodes" function in the "backref.c" file. Specifically, it adds a condition to check if "ref->level" is 0 before executing the code block. This change ensures that the extent item position is only checked when the level is 0.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch seems to address a specific bug related to the Btrfs file system. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of the code to prevent potential issues. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the bug.

4. Recommendation:
   Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the bug being fixed is critical or meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. As an AI, I would recommend further analysis by a human expert or the patch submitter to provide more context and justification for the patch's inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, based on the available information, I would lean towards a NAK (not accepting the patch in Linux -stable releases) until further analysis or justification is provided.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the call to the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` in the `filelayout_async_handle_error()` function in `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.c`. The reason for removing this call is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call, resulting in a NULL pointer and potentially causing an Oops.

The patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid the issue with the device ID instead. However, the patch does not provide any further details or justification for this change.

Without more context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. As an AI, I would need more information to make an informed decision.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to running the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver.

2. The current behavior of calling dev_close() in the offline self-test causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes interface routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior when the interface is brought down before the test.

3. The patch suggests calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close() to avoid touching IFF_UP altogether.

4. The patch includes changes in the ixgbe.h, ixgbe_ethtool.c, and ixgbe_main.c files.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to the offline self-test behavior in the ixgbe driver. It avoids an inconsistent behavior and potential data loss by calling ndo_stop() instead of dev_close(). Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The commit 0a6b76dd23fa introduced a bug that caused a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops. This bug can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes the issue: The patch modifies the code to check the "sc->memcg" variable instead of "memcg_kmem_enabled()" to ensure that only memcg-aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs. This change is sufficient to prevent the NULL pointer dereference.

3. The fix has been tested: The patch has been tested by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki and found to resolve the issue.

4. Acknowledgments: The patch has received acknowledgments from Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the fix.

5. Stable release suitability: The patch is marked as suitable for stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org [4.6+]), indicating that it meets the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to increase the maximum number of properties in the DRM subsystem from 16 to 24. The patch addresses a specific issue where on i915 machines with many TV connectors, the maximum number of properties is reached, resulting in backtraces in the logs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a limitation related to the number of properties in the DRM subsystem.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to revert a deprecation warning message related to SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. The reasons for reverting the message are outlined in the patch description:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and is considered set in stone, meaning it will not change in the future. Therefore, the deprecation warning is unnecessary.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. Many SCTP appliances are slow to migrate to newer kernels, so the warning can cause unnecessary confusion.

3) Some users may not have the ability to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users will encounter the warning and be stuck with older kernels.

Considering these reasons, it appears that the deprecation warning is causing more harm than good. Reverting the message would alleviate unnecessary confusion and provide a smoother experience for users.

Additionally, the patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and has received Acked-by from him, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted source.

Therefore, based on the criticality of the issue and the provided justifications, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the release of the mcc/mbox lock in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function in the be_cmds.c file of the be2net driver. The patch checks if be_cmd_copy() returns an error and if so, it releases the lock and returns -EBUSY.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real bug that could potentially cause a hang or data corruption. It does not seem to be a trivial fix such as a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an off-by-two bug in the "perf hists browser" tool. The bug causes misalignment of columns in the normal output.

2. The patch author, Loic Poulain, and the patch reviewer, Mika Westerberg, have both signed off on the patch. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by experts in the field, which adds credibility to its importance.

3. The patch modifies the "byt_irq_type" function in the "pinctrl-baytrail.c" file. This function is responsible for handling interrupt types for the Bay Trail platform.

4. The patch introduces a WARN statement that triggers if the "DIRECT_IRQ" bit is not cleared for pads using the IO mode. This indicates that there is a potential issue with the configuration of the IO mode, which could lead to incorrect interrupt detection.

5. The patch then proceeds to clear the "DIRECT_IRQ" bit along with other related bits, such as "BYT_TRIG_POS," "BYT_TRIG_NEG," and "BYT_TRIG_LVL." This ensures that the interrupt handling is properly configured.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to interrupt handling on the Bay Trail platform. It introduces a warning to catch misconfigurations and clears the necessary bits to ensure proper interrupt detection. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Additionally, the patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The use of shadow registers in the device causes communication between the driver and the device to become unreliable, resulting in host command timeouts. This is a significant issue that can impact the stability and functionality of the system.

2. The patch disables the feature by default: The patch sets the "shadow_reg_enable" parameter to false, effectively disabling the use of shadow registers until a fix is available for the bug. This is a reasonable approach to prevent the unreliable communication and host command timeouts.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the "shadow_reg_enable" parameter in multiple locations within the code. This indicates that the patch is addressing a non-trivial issue.

4. The patch includes relevant sign-offs: The patch includes sign-offs from multiple contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a critical bug, does not contain trivial fixes, and has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors. Therefore, the recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch reverts a previous commit (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493) that caused problems on GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link.

2. The patch modifies the stmmac_mdio_register function in stmmac_mdio.c. It adds a loop to iterate over child nodes of the device's of_node and checks if any of them are compatible with "snps,dwmac-mdio". If a compatible child node is found, it assigns it to the mdio_node variable.

3. The patch modifies the stmmac_probe_config_dt function in stmmac_platform.c. It removes the loop that searches for a child node compatible with "snps,dwmac-mdio" and assigns it to the mdio_node variable.

4. The patch removes the mdio_node variable from the plat_stmmacenet_data structure in stmmac.h.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch reverts a previous commit that caused issues with specific boards when connected to a real transceiver. The changes made in stmmac_mdio_register and stmmac_probe_config_dt functions seem to be related to handling the mdio_node variable, which is no longer used in the plat_stmmacenet_data structure.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses an issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair.
2. It mentions that MTU probing initialization only occurs at connect() and SYN or SYN-ACK reception, but these events do not happen with repaired sockets.
3. The consequence of this issue is that, with MTU probing enabled, the probing would be stuck at the tcp_base_mss value until tcp_probe_interval seconds have passed.
4. The patch adds a call to tcp_mtup_init() when the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) option is set in the tcp_repair_options_est() function.
5. The tcp_repair_options_est() function is called when setting TCP options in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state.
6. The patch is signed-off by two contributors.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair, which can lead to incorrect behavior and potential performance issues. The patch introduces a necessary call to tcp_mtup_init() to reinitialize MTU probing when the MSS option is set.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The mvsas driver is causing a General Protection Fault when encountering an expander attached ATA device. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The analysis explains the root cause of the bug: The driver assumes all ATA devices are locally attached and obtains the phy mask by indexing the local phy table. However, expanders have more phys than the HBA, causing an index overflow and returning incorrect data.

3. The patch proposes a fix: It suggests mirroring the approach used in mvs_task_prep_ssp() to obtain the phy mask using the port properties. This fix ensures that the correct phy mask is used for expander attached ATA devices, preventing the panic.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: It includes the reported-by and tested-by tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by Adam Talbot. It also includes the signed-off-by tag from James Bottomley, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the author.

5. The patch is targeted at the correct file: It modifies the mv_sas.c file in the drivers/scsi/mvsas directory, which is the appropriate location for fixing the mvsas driver.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit and fixes the shortcomings in pci_restore_state().

2. The patch correctly recognizes that Type 1 and Type 2 headers have different layouts compared to Type 0 headers. It explains that retrying the restoration of the secondary status register in Type 1 headers doesn't make sense, even if the value read back after a write is different.

3. The patch modifies the pci_restore_config_space() function to only retry the restoration of BARs for Type 0 config headers. This ensures that the behavior is consistent with the previous commit for all header types except Type 0.

4. The patch includes a Tested-by tag, indicating that it has been tested by Mikko Vinni.

5. The patch is signed-off by the relevant developers, including Linus Torvalds.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue, provides a clear explanation of the problem, and modifies the code to handle different header types correctly. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the programming of the CSMSADRCFG register in the ARM PXA3xx platform. It states that the register must be programmed to 0x2 for correct behavior of the Static Memory Controller.

2. The patch explains that without this fix, devices wired to DFI and accessed through SMC cannot be accessed after resuming from S2. This indicates a critical bug that affects functionality.

3. The patch explicitly mentions not relying on the bootloader to program the CSMSADRCFG register, suggesting that the fix should be implemented in the kernel smemc module.

4. The patch includes the necessary code changes in the smemc.c file to set the CSMSADRCFG register to 0x2 during resume.

5. The patch also includes additional documentation explaining the purpose of the CSMSADRCFG register and the significance of programming it to 0x2.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could cause issues with device access after resuming from S2. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior in the system. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, which is considered invalid according to the Software Developer's Manual (SDM). However, the code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).

2. The patch aims to get back to real mode to prepare a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER.

3. If the vCPU supports long mode, the patch clears CR4.PCIDE before CR0.PG and sets a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA.

4. For the 64-bit case, the patch clears EFER.LMA.

5. CR4.PAE is cleared before clearing EFER.LME.

6. Finally, the patch sets MSR_EFER to 0 and goes back to 32-bit mode.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the madvise_free_huge_pmd function in the mm/huge_memory.c file. The bug causes the fallback PTE operations to be skipped after splitting a transparent huge page (THP) successfully. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential issues.

The patch fixes this by modifying the code to return 0 after successfully splitting the THP. This ensures that the fallback PTE operations will be performed as intended.

The bug being fixed does not fall into the category of trivial fixes, as it can potentially cause issues such as data corruption or incorrect behavior. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Minchan Kim, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The PCI versatile host bridge driver does not remove the PCI IO resource from the host bridge resource windows if the pci_remap_iospace() call fails. This bug can lead to the kernel considering the PCI IO resource valid and assigning it to downstream devices, even if the memory addresses cannot be mapped into the CPU virtual address space.

2. The patch fixes the issue by destroying the PCI host bridge PCI IO resources retrieved through firmware when the pci_remap_iospace() function call fails. This prevents the kernel from adding the respective PCI IO resource to the list of PCI host bridge valid resources, thereby fixing the problem.

3. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag, providing a reference to the commit that introduced the bug.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant maintainers, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or performance improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only involves code refactoring without addressing any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference and a WARN_ON in dummy-hcd, which indicates the presence of real and critical bugs.

2. The changes in the patch address issues caused by moving to the UDC core framework and changes to that framework. This suggests that the patch is addressing a significant problem.

3. The patch ensures that the UDC is stopped after the gadget driver is unbound, preventing potential issues related to the order of operations.

4. The patch also ensures that the sysfs attribute file attached to the gadget is removed before the UDC is deleted, which is the correct order of operations.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and CC to the stable mailing list, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix real and critical bugs and addresses potential issues in the UDC framework. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the data type of two variables from 'u32' to 'int'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any reported issues or provide any specific justification for the change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the transmission failure on a Sierra Wireless MC7710 device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to a particular device.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression: The patch fixes a regression where the driver fails when Device Tree (DT) is enabled because the Device Tree probing code is not executed. This regression needs to be fixed to ensure proper functionality.

2. Rejigging probe() semantics: The patch modifies the probe() semantics to attempt to extract a platform ID from Device Tree if it cannot be sourced from platform data. This change ensures that the driver can identify the platform correctly when booting with DT.

3. Simplification of code: The patch removes unnecessary checks for platform data and executes the DT case only when platform data is not available. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

4. Proper error handling: The patch adds proper error handling by returning -ENODEV when both platform data and DT are missing. This ensures that the driver fails gracefully and provides a meaningful error message.

5. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Lee Jones and Linus Walleij, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs.

2. The patch ensures that the upcoming vsync interrupt handler routine will clear the wait_vsync_event atomic variable.

3. To achieve this, the patch enables and disables interrupts properly.

4. The patch is signed-off by Rahul Sharma and Inki Dae, both from Samsung.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to vsync interrupt handling in the Exynos DRM driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves enabling and disabling interrupts correctly.

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the patch qualifies as a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, it is unclear if the issue being fixed falls under the categories of build error, oops, hang, data corruption, real security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, a more informed decision could be made with additional details about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to dropping the voltage to Vmin when the Gfx is power gated for the latest VLV revision. The patch drops a workaround that is no longer needed for the latest VLV revision and instead requests the minimum frequency to bring the voltage Vnn.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to data corruption. The patch ensures that the timestamp is set as the last element in the channel specification, which is necessary for correct interpretation of the data by userspace code reading the layout of the buffer via sysfs.

Given that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch description states that it is safer to turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator. This is because the driver will turn off the regcache_cache_only after enabling the regulator. If cache_only remains false, certain commands like 'amixer cset' may fail if run before wm8962_resume().

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch involve adding the line "regcache_cache_only(wm8962->regmap, true);" before the call to "regulator_bulk_disable()".

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and code changes, it appears that this patch addresses a potential issue related to the order of operations when disabling the regulator. By turning on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator, it ensures that certain commands will not fail when executed before wm8962_resume().

   This patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that could potentially lead to failures in certain commands.

4. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that addresses a potential issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of the exit code -1 with the portable value EXIT_FAILURE. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a general protection fault (GPF) caused by a line discipline that does not define a receive_buf() method. The previous commit already addressed this issue, but the vt driver and speakup driver still push selection data directly to the line discipline receive_buf() method via tty_ldisc_receive_buf(). This patch aims to fix the same problem in tty_ldisc_receive_buf().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a GPF. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug in the ocfs2_file_aio_write() function in the ocfs2 file system. The bug causes a lock to be left held if ocfs2_inode_lock() fails, which can lead to issues in ocfs2_lock_res_free().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can potentially cause data corruption or other issues. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a reported issue where the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) L2 header check fails on IB/ipoib (InfiniBand over IP) traffic. The patch proposes a more generic approach to the L2 header check, taking into account the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes.

The patch modifies the __napi_gro_receive() function in the net/core/dev.c file. It introduces a new variable, maclen, which stores the hard_header_len value of the skb (socket buffer). The subsequent code block checks if maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length) and performs a comparison using compare_ether_header() function. If maclen is not equal to ETH_HLEN, it performs a memcmp() comparison.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to the GRO L2 header check on IB/ipoib traffic. It introduces a more generic approach to handle different L2 header lengths. The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a mis-merge in gmap handling in the s390 architecture. The commit message explains that some changes were dropped during a previous merge, which caused KVM to fail for certain memory sizes, specifically 2GB.

The patch itself modifies the gmap_map_segment function in the gmap.c file. It updates the condition for checking the validity of the memory range, ensuring that the "from + len - 1" and "to + len - 1" values do not exceed certain limits.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause KVM to fail for specific memory sizes. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a check for port PM availability in the AMDGPU driver.
2. It addresses an issue where the ATPX method may not always exist on the dedicated GPU (dGPU) and could be located on the integrated GPU (iGPU).
3. The parent device of the iGPU is the root port, and if the bridge_d3 flag is false, it accidentally enables the legacy PM method, which conflicts with port PM and prevents the dGPU from powering on.
4. The patch fixes this issue by correctly checking the bridge_d3 flag to determine if the legacy PM method should be enabled.
5. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag referencing the commit that introduced the issue.
6. It also includes a "Reported-and-tested-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported and tested by Mike Lothian.
7. The patch is signed-off by the authors and includes a Cc to the stable mailing list.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that could prevent the dGPU from powering on, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes and includes proper documentation and testing.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is a revert of a previous commit that caused booting issues on a custom AT91RM9200 board. The issue was that the board would stop booting after the "Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel" message.

2. The revert of the commit fixes the booting issue and allows the board to boot again.

3. Further debugging reveals that the issue was caused by a boundary check problem in the ioremap function. The if condition in the changed code incorrectly believed that the SRAM mapping would fit the requested mapping, leading to incorrect behavior.

4. The original premise of the "fix" patch was also found to be wrong. The condition checking boundaries didn't take the in-page offset into consideration, even though the code already handled the requested offset into the page.

5. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Nicolas Pitre, indicating that it has been tested and approved by another developer.

Based on these points, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a critical bug that caused booting issues on a specific board. It addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make dropped packets consume the NAPI budget in the octeon-ethernet staging driver. This is done to ensure that the NAPI handler does not run for an extended period.

2. Patch Impact: The patch modifies the cvm_oct_napi_poll function in the ethernet-rx.c file of the octeon-ethernet driver. It increments the rx_count variable to count dropped packets and removes the rx_count increment in the else block.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific issue related to dropped packets and the NAPI handler running for too long.
   - It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic and behavior.
   - The patch does not introduce any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
   - There is no mention of any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues being fixed by this patch.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix since it does not fix a critical bug or address any real issues like build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential lost wakeup scenario in the staging driver "quatech_usb2" when using the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl. The patch addresses a race condition between the qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status.

The patch introduces a barrier() to ensure memory ordering, sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and uses __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING) to mark the task as running when returning from the loop.

Considering the patch addresses a potential issue that could result in a lost wakeup scenario, it can be categorized as fixing an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made and evaluate if they meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch simplifies the code by allowing idling of both MUSB and PHY when nothing is configured. This change improves power management (PM) runtime and PHY handling for the 2430 glue layer.

2. A warning is added if the PHY is not configured, which helps in identifying potential issues.

3. In the `omap2430_musb_init` function, the `phy_init` function is called to initialize the PHY.

4. In the `omap2430_musb_enable` function, the `phy_power_on` function is called to power on the PHY.

5. In the `omap2430_musb_disable` function, the `phy_power_off` function is called to power off the PHY.

6. In the `omap2430_musb_exit` function, the `phy_exit` function is called to clean up the PHY.

7. In the `omap2430_remove` function, the `cancel_work_sync` function is called to cancel the mailbox work.

8. In the `omap2430_runtime_suspend` function, the `omap2430_low_level_exit` function is called to exit the low-level operations.

9. In the `omap2430_runtime_resume` function, the `omap2430_low_level_init` function is called to initialize the low-level operations.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to improve power management and PHY handling for the 2430 glue layer. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VCE ring test on Big-Endian systems. The patch ensures that every write to the ring is translated to little-endian. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an issue specific to Big-Endian systems, which may not be considered a critical bug affecting a wide range of users.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The maximum value for the range of entropy count in generating the random offset to the mmap_base address was limited to 32 bits for 64-bit x86 systems. This limitation could be increased further, requiring more than 32 bits of randomness.

2. The patch introduces a new function: get_random_long(). This function operates the same as get_random_int() but returns an unsigned long, providing the necessary additional randomness for systems that require more than 32 bits.

3. The patch fixes the shifting constant in mmap_rnd() to be an unsigned long. This ensures that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is crucial for x86 systems, as values over 31 bits would previously act as a no-op and effectively disable mmap_base randomization.

4. The patch replaces calls to get_random_int() with get_random_long() where appropriate, ensuring consistent and correct usage of the new function.

Overall, this patch addresses a critical bug and provides a necessary enhancement to the randomization mechanism. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue arises when calling xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice on a V4 superblock, which leads to setting both pquotino and gquotino to NULLFSINO. This can cause unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes the bug: It makes the function safe to call twice and removes the extra calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk.

3. The bug is specific to V4 superblocks: The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the behavior exists on V4 superblocks. This means it does not affect the default behavior of V5 superblocks.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reported by Eryu Guan, reviewed by Carlos Maiolino, and signed-off by Eric Sandeen and Dave Chinner.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and has been reviewed and tested by relevant parties.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Cc tags for proper attribution and communication.
4. The patch provides a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list for reference.
5. The changes in the patch are minimal and focused on fixing the bug without introducing any trivial changes.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to assigning a domain to a non-existent irq descriptor. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue: The patch resolves an infinite loop issue that occurs when the Exynos DRM driver is enabled and a multi-platform kernel is used.

2. The issue is critical: An infinite loop can cause system hangs or crashes, impacting the stability and usability of the system.

3. The patch provides a temporary solution: The patch registers the Exynos DRM device object only for Exynos SoC, which resolves the infinite loop issue. It is mentioned that a more generic solution will be implemented later.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve conditional registration of the device object based on the machine compatibility.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to address the critical issue of the infinite loop.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two audio-related bugs in the hdpvr driver. The first bug causes the audio input to be changed inadvertently when the audio encoding is changed. The second bug, introduced in kernel 3.10, breaks the handling of the default_audio_input module option.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses real and critical bugs that can potentially lead to issues such as audio corruption or incorrect audio input. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Additionally, the patch also fixes a small typo, which can be considered a trivial fix. However, since it is included along with the critical bug fixes, it does not solely consist of trivial changes. Therefore, it does not violate the criteria for accepting the patch.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and does not take into account any potential conflicts or compatibility issues with other parts of the Linux kernel.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the trace_marker file adds the trace mark to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer.

2. Impact: This issue does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the functionality of the trace_marker file.

3. Patch Analysis:
   - The patch introduces a new variable `tr` of type `struct trace_array` to hold the instance's buffer.
   - The `tr` variable is assigned the value of `filp->private_data`, which is expected to be a pointer to the instance's buffer.
   - The assignment of `buffer` is changed from `global_trace.trace_buffer.buffer` to `tr->trace_buffer.buffer`, ensuring that the trace mark is added to the correct buffer.

4. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, this patch does fix an issue that affects the functionality of the trace_marker file. Although it does not address a critical bug or a security issue, it can be considered a non-trivial fix that improves the behavior of the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that the final decision may depend on the specific policies and guidelines of the Linux kernel development team.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch avoids a duplicate call to `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` for `ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE` within `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. This duplication is unnecessary since the call already occurs once during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation.

2. The patch removes the local `conn->stat_sn` assignment and increment, indicating that this should be handled by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

3. The third parameter to `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` is changed to signal that it should be done by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential duplication issue and simplifies the code by removing unnecessary assignments and increments. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement for the render backends in the DRM Radeon driver.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the `of_get_display_timings()` function in the `drivers/video/of_display_timing.c` file. The patch correctly adds a `kfree(dt)` statement to free the memory allocated for `dt` in case `of_parse_display_timing()` fails.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is a revert of a previous commit that claimed throughput improvement for MSC/UVC. However, the author states that they did not observe significant improvement in their measurements.

2. The patch introduces regressions, including a complete breakage of the ASIX usb-ethernet dongle on UDP RX and console log flooding with error messages when unplugging a 3G modem.

3. The change in the patch removes the HCD_BH flag, which is responsible for handling urb return in the bottom half. This flag is likely to have been added for a specific reason, and removing it may have unintended consequences.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch does not fix a critical bug or address a real issue. Instead, it reverts a previous commit and introduces regressions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced in the previous fix commit. The regression caused a bug in rfkill notification to user-space. The patch correctly resets the firmware after rfkill is turned off and also sets the hardware state using wiphy_rfkill_set_hw_state.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a regression and improve functionality rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch and the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch description explains that when the pipe A force quirk is applied, attempting to grab a crtc mutex during intel_modeset_setup_hw_state() can lead to a deadlock. This is a real issue that can cause hangs or other problems.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It specifically addresses the deadlock issue caused by grabbing crtc mutexes.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The patch is a fix for a regression introduced in a previous commit. It does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially cause new bugs or regressions.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Ville Syrjälä and Daniel Vetter, who are both recognized developers in the Linux kernel community.

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xmon data-breakpoint feature in the powerpc architecture. The patch addresses an issue where the hw_breakpoint_handler does not find any associated perf_event with a matched watchpoint, causing the core code to continue calling other breakpoint handlers instead of notifying xmon.

Considering that this patch fixes a bug that can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock in the IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) subsystem when overlayfs is used. The bug is reported by Krisztian Litkey and the patch is signed-off by Miklos Szeredi.

The patch modifies the code in two files: ima_appraise.c and ima_main.c. In both files, the patch replaces the usage of `file->f_path.dentry` with the `file_dentry(file)` function, which is a helper function that returns the dentry associated with the file.

The change is necessary because IMA tries to call `->setxattr()` on overlayfs dentry after having locked the underlying inode, which results in a deadlock. By using `file_dentry()` instead of `file->f_path.dentry`, the patch ensures that the correct dentry is used, avoiding the deadlock.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the IPv6 code related to the allocation of ICMPv6 destination entries. The bug was causing crashes in the mld_sendpack() function.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug report states that when DDW (64-bit direct DMA on Power) is not enabled for NVMe devices, a fallback to 32-bit DMA via the IOMMU occurs, which uses 4K TCEs. However, the NVMe device driver assumes that the DMA alignment for the PRP entries matches the device's page size, causing a bug in nvme_setup_prps().

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch changes the default device page size to 4K, which matches the IOMMU's page size used for DMA alignment. This ensures that the DMA alignment matches the device's page size and resolves the bug.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a functional issue and does not include trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has been tested: The patch has been tested with a hardware test exerciser and has been found to prevent the kernel from triggering a BUG within a few minutes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the devfreq subsystem. The patch changes the allocation of memory for the devfreq statistics data structure to use the devfreq device pointer instead of the parent device pointer. This change ensures that the allocated memory is properly freed when the devfreq is disabled at runtime.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to resource leakage, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The MAYA44 USB(+) driver has a workaround for an error in the mixer unit descriptor. However, this workaround causes the capture mixer controls to be missing.

2. The patch fixes the bug: By moving the check for the descriptor error after the parsing of the unit's input pins, the patch ensures that the capture mixer controls are not missing.

3. The bug can cause functional issues: Missing input volume controls can impact the usability and functionality of the MAYA44 USB(+) device.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the parsing logic and addressing a specific hardware issue.

The patch addresses this issue by ensuring that the driver's main thread gives priority to events over command responses. It does so by checking for events before processing command responses.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific crash issue on AMD Trinity systems when running as a Xen Dom0. The patch stubs out MSR methods that are not needed, which resolves the crash. However, it also suggests that a larger patch should be added to remove the paravirt machinery completely for the methods that have no users.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that causes a crash. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the suggestion to remove the paravirt machinery completely for unused methods should be considered for future improvements.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to IOV resource sorting by alignment requirement in the PCI subsystem.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a specific issue related to resource sorting.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The commit message states that the previous check in the code was incorrect, leading to a major regression in 3.9-rc1. This regression affects the functionality of the USB connection when loading g_ether, causing the code to incorrectly detect the cable as off and power down the phy immediately.

2. The patch fixes the bug: The patch modifies the check in the code to properly handle the initialization and readiness of the musb core. It first checks if the _glue is NULL and returns an error message if it is not yet initialized. If _glue is initialized, it memorizes the status and then checks if the musb core is ready.

3. The fix is non-trivial: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to the readiness check in the omap_musb_mailbox function.

4. The patch is signed-off by relevant contributors: The patch is signed-off by Aaro Koskinen and Felipe Balbi, who are identified as contributors to the drivers/usb/musb/omap2430.c file.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the vc4 driver for the DRM subsystem. The patch updates the function `vc4_crtc_destroy_state` to call `drm_atomic_helper_crtc_destroy_state` instead of `__drm_atomic_helper_crtc_destroy_state`. 

Since this patch addresses a real bug that can cause memory leaks, it qualifies as a fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a bug that causes an oops at boot. The patch corrects the conversion from __get_cpu_var() to this_cpu_ptr() in the iic_setup_cpu() function by using the correct per-cpu address of struct cpu_iic.

Since the bug causes an oops, which is a critical issue, and the patch addresses the issue directly without any trivial fixes, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any new issues or regressions.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The function `brcmf_sdio_fromevntchan()` was being called on the data frame instead of the software header, causing mischaracterization of frames as on the event channel rather than the data channel.

2. The bug fix addresses a major performance regression: The incorrect processing of packets was causing a significant drop in download speed (from 40Mbit/s to 1Mbit/s).

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Arend van Spriel, indicating that it has undergone a review process and received approval.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug, which helps in tracking the issue.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the author and the reviewer.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer exception in the extcon-max8997 driver when platform data is not supplied. This bug could potentially lead to a crash or other issues. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause a hang or an oops. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the RTC tracking code in the KVM ioapic driver. The patch introduces a new function `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` which checks if `pending_eoi` is negative and calls `kvm_rtc_eoi_tracking_restore_all` to recompute a correct `dest_map` and `pending_eoi` if necessary. 

The patch also adds a call to `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` in the function `__rtc_irq_eoi_tracking_restore_one` to ensure that `pending_eoi` is valid after decrementing it. Additionally, the function `rtc_irq_eoi` also calls `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` after decrementing `pending_eoi`.

Overall, this patch seems to address a potential issue where `pending_eoi` could become negative, leading to a subsequent `BUG_ON` check in `ioapic_service`. The patch ensures that if `pending_eoi` is ever nonzero, the correct values are recomputed to avoid triggering the `BUG_ON` check.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue that could lead to a bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that attempted to fix a reported issue with the "capacity_now" value being higher than the "full_charge_capacity" value when the battery is fully charged.

2. The patch author argues that it is not unexpected for "capacity_now" to increase above "full_charge_capacity" due to variations in charging cycles and battery firmware behavior. Good battery firmware may update "full_charge_capacity" when the current charging cycle is complete, even increasing it if necessary.

3. The patch claims that capping "capacity_now" to "full_charge_capacity" is incorrect and that printing a warning if they don't match the "design_capacity" is both annoying and wrong.

4. The patch explains that the current behavior results in bogus warnings on perfectly working systems/firmwares and incorrect values being reported for "capacity_now" and "full_charge_capacity" after the warning has been triggered.

5. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag referencing the previous commit that introduced the issue.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the patch author and another developer.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the previous commit introduced a behavior that is not actually a bug but rather a normal variation in battery behavior. Reverting the commit would address the reported issue and prevent unnecessary warnings and incorrect values. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a potential issue in the mcb_probe() function of the mcb-core.c driver. The patch adds a call to get_device() to acquire a reference to the probed device, which is necessary as the device is being used in the function.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential panic issue found during stress testing and has been reported and tested by multiple individuals, it seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the number of PWM channels in the LPC32xx SoC. The patch correctly sets the number of PWM channels to 1 instead of 2, which allows for separate configuration of different clock parents and gates for both PWM controllers.

Since this patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a problem in the xhci-hcd's resume routine, which indicates a real and critical bug.
2. The issue addressed by the patch is related to the controller being put back to sleep before it can activate its IRQ line, potentially causing a race condition and preventing the wakeup condition from being handled.
3. The patch simplifies the logic in xhci_resume by combining some repeated flag settings into a single pair of statements, improving code readability and maintainability.
4. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Alan Stern, Greg Kroah-Hartman, and Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.
5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, improves code logic, and has received appropriate review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to sparse warnings in the drivers/of/platform.c file. The patch changes the type of the "reg" variable from "const u32 *" to "const __be32 *". 

Since this patch is a trivial fix and does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an unbalanced mutex issue in the dma_pool_create() function. The bug was introduced in the 3.16 kernel version. 

The patch correctly addresses the issue by unlocking the mutex in the error case. This fix is important as an unbalanced mutex can lead to various issues such as deadlocks or data corruption.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) on the arm64 architecture. The bug causes a regression in the coarse clock monotonicity, where obtaining a timestamp via syscall and subsequently obtaining a timestamp for the same clock ID via VDSO can result in an incorrect timestamp.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `update_vsyscall` function in `arch/arm64/kernel/vdso.c`. It replaces the usage of `__current_kernel_time()` with the `timekeeper` object provided by the timekeeping core. This ensures that the VDSO uses the correct timekeeper object and resolves the regression.

Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect timestamps. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue related to the arm64 architecture.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a module autoload issue in the net DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver for the Broadcom B53 switch. The patch exports the module alias information using the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro, allowing user-space to match the registered device with the corresponding module.

This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a functionality improvement related to module autoload.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of i2c_hid_stop() in the i2c-hid driver releases all the buffers associated with the device, including the command buffer. However, when the i2c-hid driver itself is unloaded, it tries to power down the device by sending a PWR_SLEEP command. Since the command buffer is already released, it leads to a kernel NULL pointer dereference and a crash.

2. The bug causes a crash and is not a trivial issue. The crash is triggered when unloading the i2c-hid driver, which can potentially impact system stability and reliability.

3. The patch provides a fix by removing the call to i2c_hid_free_buffers() in i2c_hid_stop(). This ensures that the buffers are only freed when the i2c-hid driver itself is removed, preventing the crash.

4. The patch includes the Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the bug.

5. The patch has been reported by Gabriele Mazzotta and reviewed by Benjamin Tissoires, adding credibility to its importance and correctness.

Based on this analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent the crash.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression issue related to suspending the graphics driver. The patch ensures that the Page Table Entries (PTEs) are properly flushed before suspending, which prevents potential issues with the Graphics Translation Table (GTT) and avoids harm caused by the regression.

The patch also includes a bugzilla reference, a tested-by tag, and signed-off-by tags from relevant individuals, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues with suspending the graphics driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a critical bug related to the IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt) domain. The bug causes the affinity mask to be overwritten by the cpu_online_mask, leading to a crash when ipi_destroy() is called on a multi-cpu system.

The patch sets the IRQ_NO_BALANCING flag to prevent the affinity from being overwritten by setup_affinity(). This ensures that the IPI is delivered to the intended target CPU and avoids the crash caused by freeing unallocated cpumask_weight() IRQs.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to a system crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific behavior in the ACPI device scanning process. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch aims to modify the behavior of acpi_find_child_device() in cases where there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope.
2. Currently, the first device found to be present (with the help of _STA) is returned, which covers most cases.
3. However, if some of the devices have a _HID or _CID returning valid ACPI/PNP device IDs (which is disallowed by the spec), the ASL writers' expectation is that the OS will match devices without a valid ACPI/PNP device ID against a given bus address first.
4. To address this special case, the patch suggests modifying find_child_checks() to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them.
5. The patch includes a comment acknowledging that this modification violates the spec and that any action taken is best effort.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific case where the current behavior does not align with the ASL writers' expectation and provides a best effort solution. However, it is important to note that this patch violates the ACPI spec, so it should be carefully reviewed and tested to ensure it does not introduce any unintended side effects.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch fixes the broken evtype mask in the ARMv8 architecture to include the NSH (Non-Secure Hypervisor) bit, allowing profiling at EL2.

2. Impact: This patch addresses a bug in the ARMv8 architecture that affects the event selection register (PMXEVTYPER). Without this fix, profiling at EL2 would not be possible, which could impact performance analysis and debugging capabilities on ARMv8-based systems.

3. Criticality: The bug addressed by this patch does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the functionality and usability of the ARMv8 architecture for profiling purposes.

4. Triviality: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It specifically addresses the broken evtype mask in the ARMv8 architecture.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases). While the patch addresses an issue that affects the functionality of the ARMv8 architecture, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for inclusion in the next major release or a development branch rather than a stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to memory leaks on resume_latency.notifiers.
2. It restores the original behavior of freeing the notifiers pointer on qos->resume_latency, which is used.
3. The patch fixes a kmemleak warning, indicating that it resolves a real bug that could potentially cause memory corruption.
4. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which indicates that it is addressing a known problem.
5. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating that it has undergone review and approval.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it fixes a real and critical bug related to memory leaks and has been properly reviewed and signed-off.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the usbvision driver. The patch checks the number of endpoints before accessing the endpoint array to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array.

Since this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, my analysis is as follows:

1. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock from the imx-tve driver in the imx-drm subsystem.
2. The patch explains that the enable_lock is unnecessary because DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions.
3. The patch also mentions that holding a spinlock while calling clk_prepare_enable() is incorrect and can cause a might_sleep() warning.
4. The patch is signed-off by Russell King and Acked-by Sascha Hauer.
5. The patch is also signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch removes unnecessary code and resolves potential issues with the enable_lock spinlock. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and addresses a potential problem that could lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the stk_camera_read_reg() function in the stk-webcam driver.
2. It introduces a new variable "buf" of type unsigned char pointer.
3. It allocates memory for "buf" using kmalloc() with the size of a single u8 element.
4. If the memory allocation fails, it returns -ENOMEM.
5. It calls usb_control_msg() to perform a USB control message transfer.
6. The buffer passed to usb_control_msg() is changed from "(u8 *) value" to "buf".
7. The size of the buffer passed to usb_control_msg() is changed from "sizeof(u8)" to "sizeof(u8)".
8. It checks the return value of usb_control_msg() and if it is greater than or equal to 0, it copies the value from "buf" to the "value" pointer using memcpy().
9. It frees the allocated memory using kfree().
10. It returns the value of ret.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue with using a stack-allocated buffer for DMA operations in the stk_camera_read_reg() function. It allocates memory dynamically using kmalloc() and properly frees it using kfree(). The patch also updates the buffer passed to usb_control_msg() and copies the value to the "value" pointer if the usb_control_msg() call succeeds.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential issue related to DMA and USB control messages, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes two issues. First, it adds a check for the return value of `rpc_clone_client()` function. Second, it ensures that the cloned `rpc_clnt` is shut down in case of a specific error condition.

2. The code is simplified by moving the call to `rpc_clone_client()` after `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` has completed its execution.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a bug related to memory leaks caused by the replacement of the original value of 'client' in the `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` function. The bug fix is non-trivial and does not involve any trivial changes like spelling or whitespace.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it appears to be a real and critical issue that could potentially cause data corruption or other problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made and evaluate if they meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch aims to improve SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) balancing in the Linux kernel scheduler. It avoids selecting a sibling thread if there is an idle core available that shares cache. This fix addresses the common case where there is a shared cache core available for balancing.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. It introduces a new variable `smt` to track whether SMT balancing is needed.
2. It adds a label `again` to allow re-iteration in case SMT balancing is required.
3. It modifies the loop that iterates through the sched domains to skip domains that have the `SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER` flag set and `smt` is not set.
4. It adds a loop within each sched domain to iterate through the sched groups and find an eligible idle CPU.
5. It checks if the CPU is idle and sets the target CPU accordingly.
6. It adds a label `next` to skip to the next sched group if the current group does not have an idle CPU.
7. It adds a label `done` to exit the loop once an eligible idle CPU is found.
8. It unlocks the RCU read lock and returns the target CPU.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be an optimization to improve SMT balancing in the scheduler. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for setting queue limits for the admin queue in the NVMe driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets the device-specific queue limits and applies them to the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This is done to address the issue of the command size on the admin queue being arbitrarily low.

2. The helper function checks if `ctrl->max_hw_sectors` is set and if so, it sets the maximum hardware sectors and maximum segments for the queue. This ensures that the queue can handle the specified number of sectors and segments.

3. If `ctrl->stripe_size` is set, the helper function sets the chunk sectors for the queue. This ensures that the queue can handle the specified stripe size.

4. If `ctrl->vwc & NVME_CTRL_VWC_PRESENT` is true, the helper function enables flushing for the queue. This ensures that the queue supports flush and force unit access commands.

5. Finally, the helper function sets the virtual boundary for the queue based on `ctrl->page_size`.

6. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function is called in two places: `nvme_init_identify` and `nvme_alloc_ns`. This ensures that the queue limits are properly set for the admin queue during initialization and when allocating a new namespace.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue by setting the necessary queue limits for the admin queue in the NVMe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK) in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the OMAP4/5/DRA7 platforms in order to prevent misconfigured timings and potential device loss on the bus. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it seems to address a potential issue that could lead to misconfigured timings and device loss.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for defining and using an explicit "CONNECTED" state in the libceph module. The patch adds the CONNECTED state and updates the code to set and clear this state appropriately.

Analyzing the patch, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code improvement or enhancement.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the USB gadget serial driver. The patch adds a pointer checking to avoid accessing a NULL pointer in the function.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a potential hang or crash issue, which qualifies as a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects an allocation size issue in the watchdog core. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or significant improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The patch addresses a bug where the function `intel_check_page_flip()` generates lots of warnings when called in soft-IRQ context due to the use of `in_irq()`.

2. The bug can cause warnings: The bug can lead to warnings being generated, indicating a potential issue in the code.

3. The patch improves context checking: The patch replaces the use of `in_irq()` with `in_interrupt()`, which allows for either type of interrupt context. This change ensures that the page flip code is not misused when called from non-interrupt context.

4. Bugzilla reference: The patch includes a reference to the Bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321), indicating that the bug has been reported and tracked.

5. Reviewed and signed-off: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, which adds credibility to its correctness and importance.

6. Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org: The patch is also marked for consideration in stable releases, indicating that it is deemed important enough to be backported to older, stable versions of the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. The patch aims to use a stored value for the maximum voltage (max_vddc) instead of looking it up manually each time.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to power management, which can potentially impact the stability and performance of the system. Therefore, it can be considered a real bug fix.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly mention any of these issues. However, power management issues can lead to system instability, performance degradation, or even potential security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on addressing the specific issue at hand.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable, causing the device to not wake up for important events.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the issue, stating that enabling autosuspend works for some people with specific USB host controllers but not for others. It also mentions that there were patches to the xHCI USB controller that fixed the issue for some, but not all.

3. The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and relevant Cc's to ensure proper attribution and communication.

4. The code changes in the patch simply remove the call to `usb_enable_autosuspend` for Intel Bluetooth devices, indicating that autosuspend will not be enabled for these devices.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue with the autosuspend feature for Intel Bluetooth devices. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves reverting a previous commit and provides a clear explanation of the problem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is fixing the length calculation for ethtool statistics in the qlcnic driver. While it is important to have accurate length calculations, this patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic error in the original implementation of the code. The patch corrects the clock disable logic in the sdhi and mmcif drivers. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that corrects a logic error.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix the wrong minimal dump size obtained from rtnl_calcit() function in RT netlink. Currently, the function does not account for the size of the header of the netlink message, and this patch aims to fix that.

2. Impact: The issue addressed by the patch does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an internal correctness issue related to the calculation of the minimal dump size for netlink messages.

3. Triviality: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It seems to address a specific issue related to the calculation of the minimal dump size.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential NAK. While it addresses an internal correctness issue, it does not seem to fix a critical bug or a real security issue. However, further context and information about the impact of the issue could potentially change this assessment.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "xHCI: Clear PLC for USB2 root hub ports." It aims to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function.

2. Purpose of the Patch:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of USB2 root hub ports. Currently, the PLC is cleared for USB3 root hub ports but not for USB2 ports. This patch aims to clear the PLC for USB2 root hub ports as well.

3. Patch Details:
   The patch modifies the handle_port_status() function in the xHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) driver. It adds a conditional check to clear the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports if the speed of the host controller is not HCD_USB3.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to the handling of USB2 root hub ports. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential inconsistency in the clearing of the PLC bit. However, without further context or information about the impact of not clearing the PLC bit for USB2 ports, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue.

5. Recommendation:
   Given the limited information available, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further analysis and understanding of the impact of not clearing the PLC bit for USB2 ports would be necessary to make an informed decision.

Therefore, the recommendation is to further investigate the issue and gather more information before making a decision on whether to accept or reject this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: It fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference that was introduced in a previous commit.

2. The bug can lead to a NULL pointer dereference: The patch explains that in certain cases, when waiting for the endpoint to be enabled, the functionfs_bind() has not been called yet, and the epfile->ffs->gadget is still NULL. Later on, the 'gadget' variable is used as a parameter to usb_ep_align_maybe(), which dereferences it.

3. The patch provides a solution: It moves the assignment of the 'gadget' variable after the potential waiting has completed, ensuring that it is not dereferenced when it is still NULL.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers: It has been signed-off by Andrzej Pietrasiewicz, Michal Nazarewicz, and Felipe Balbi, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a real bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to a non-existent VGA port on a Fujitsu D3003-S2 board. The bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists a VGA port that does not actually exist.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a connector quirk for the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board.
   - This indicates that the patch is targeting a specific hardware issue.

2. The bug report (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83184) confirms the existence of the bug and its impact.
   - This suggests that the bug is a real and critical issue.

3. The patch includes a check for the specific device and subsystem vendor and device IDs.
   - This ensures that the quirk is only applied to the affected hardware.

4. The patch conditionally returns false if the connector type is VGA.
   - This indicates that the patch is addressing the incorrect listing of VGA as a valid connector type.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to incorrect connector information on the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board, and it does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function call in the lpc_eth.c driver. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the KVM virtualization module in the Linux kernel. The patch ensures that if the guest sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value, a general protection fault (#GP) is injected. This is important for maintaining the stability and security of the virtualized environment.

The patch introduces a new function called `kvm_mtrr_valid` in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c` and `arch/x86/kvm/x86.h` files. This function checks the validity of the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values. It is used to validate the MSR_IA32_CR_PAT (PAT CR) value in the `vmx_set_msr` function in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c`.

Overall, this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to the handling of the PAT CR in the KVM virtualization module. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to power-saving (PS) idle behavior in the ath9k driver. The patch corrects an inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK, ensuring that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission (tx) is pending.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to power-saving behavior, which can impact the performance and functionality of the ath9k driver.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? While the patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, power-saving behavior is crucial for efficient operation, and incorrect handling can lead to performance degradation or unexpected behavior.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch addresses a specific issue related to power-saving behavior and does not include trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to power-saving behavior in the ath9k driver without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel oops triggered by dereferencing a NULL Rx skb. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and hdelta is just slightly larger than half a buffer time. In such cases, the current implementation incorrectly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this issue, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that even in scenarios where hdelta is just slightly larger than half a buffer time, the interrupt will not be considered double acknowledged.

The patch also mentions that jiffies, which is used for hdelta calculation, is not high resolution and may have inaccuracies. This is an important consideration for the fix.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific bug that can lead to incorrect handling of interrupts in the PCM subsystem. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata. The current implementation uses the padded length instead of the real length, which is a bug according to the specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all the specified metadata has been 32-bit, where the aligned and data length are the same width. However, it is still important to fix this bug to adhere to the specification.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not necessary. Nevertheless, including it in the patch does not cause any harm.

3. The patch gets rid of magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the bug fix.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug in the encoding of metadata and improves code quality by removing magic numbers. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to USB Link Power Management (LPM) functionality in the Linux kernel. The bug causes the LPM feature to be non-functional due to the lack of setting the "lpm_capable" field for the root hub device.

The patch adds the necessary code to check and set "lpm_capable" when registering a root hub device, ensuring that LPM is functional. It also mentions that the patch can be backported to older kernels as old as v3.15, which indicates that it is a stable candidate.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that the patch addresses it directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current implementation counts all interrupts as false ones if there is nothing the driver can do with them. However, this is not always true, as there may be a valid SCI EC interrupt fired during normal read/write operations.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It adds a check to ensure that if the SCI bit is set in the status, the interrupt is not considered false. This prevents valid SCI interrupts from being incorrectly counted as false ones.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the identified issue.

4. The patch is signed-off by two developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could lead to false interrupt counts. It does not introduce any trivial changes and has been reviewed by developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The bug can result in a significant performance impact and potentially disrupt the system's stability.

3. The patch fixes the issue by skipping the assignment and assuming imbalance=0 when local->avg_load > sds->avg_load, preventing the imbalance overflow.

4. The patch includes a detailed description of the bug and how to reproduce it, providing valuable information for testing and verification.

5. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and improve the stability and performance of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to enabling Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) support for all variants of RGMII interfaces in the Linux kernel's network subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description explains that RGMII interfaces have different variants with different internal delays or no delays at all.
2. The patch extends the check for PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to cover all RGMII variants, as EEE should be allowed for any of these modes.
3. The "Fixes" tag references a specific commit that introduced EEE support and access to MMD registers in the PHY subsystem.
4. The patch is signed-off by Florian Fainelli and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
5. The code changes in the patch modify the phy_init_eee() function in the phy.c file.
6. The modified code checks if the duplex mode is full and the interface is either MII, GMII, or any variant of RGMII (PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID).
7. If the conditions are met, the EEE feature is enabled for the PHY device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to enabling EEE support for all RGMII variants. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic and extending the check for RGMII variants. However, without further context or information about the severity of the issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the Linux kernel maintainers and experts to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix the WARNING "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" that is triggered during unloading a block driver.

2. The patch removes the unnecessary freezing and unfreezing of the queue in the blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() function.

3. The freezing and unfreezing of the queue were previously done in blk_mq_freeze_queue() and blk_mq_unfreeze_queue() functions, respectively.

4. Since the queue is already frozen by blk_cleanup_queue() before the queue release, there is no need to freeze it again for deleting the tag set.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to the "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" warning. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses the bug by correctly defining the limits for div1 (TIMING_CLOCK_DIVIDE) and div2 (TIMING_CLOCK_RATE+1) and adjusting the clock rate calculation logic. It also includes proper error handling when the clock rate cannot be set to the requested value.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can lead to incorrect functionality and performance degradation in the mxs-mmc driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove limits for the amount of system-wide message queues in the Linux kernel. The patch explains that the current limits imposed by the previous commit are too low and cause issues for certain workloads and use cases.

The patch includes a reported issue from a user and references a bug report that further supports the need for removing the limits. The proposed solution is to revert the limits entirely and fallback to the original behavior where new queues cannot be created once a user's resource limit is reached and all memory is used.

Considering the nature of the patch and the reported issues, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can impact users' applications and workloads. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a real bug: The commit f8ec894945e7d205ce62be59e55e72c4304e4739 introduced a bug that broke external users of input_mt_is_used(). This bug caused a breakage in the detection of used slots.

6. The patch increments the frame count: The patch increments the frame count in both input_mt_drop_unused() and input_mt_sync_frame() functions. This ensures that the frame count is correctly updated.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to ensuring that the request and response queue addresses are written to the registers before they are used. This can prevent potential errors or inconsistencies in the operation of the qla3xxx driver.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue that falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" but does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the UniMAC reset in the bcm_sysport_resume() function. The bug can lead to receive FIFO corruptions coming out of a suspend cycle, resulting in corrupted/duplicate packets being delivered towards the host CPU interface. This issue can be reproduced on a crowded network with Wake-on-LAN enabled for the specific interface.

The patch adds the necessary UniMAC reset in the bcm_sysport_resume() function to address the problem. This ensures that the UniMAC receive is properly disabled during the small window when the RDMA and RBUF engines are not ready, preventing packets from getting stuck in the UniMAC RX FIFO and being delivered as corrupted.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and affects system stability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ath9k: Fix PS wrappers in ath9k_set_coverage_class". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to power-saving (PS) wrappers in the ath9k driver.

2. The patch description mentions that the callback is called during suspend/resume and via the iw command. This indicates that the code being modified is involved in power management and configuration of parameters related to sifs, slottime, and acktimeout.

3. The patch modifies the `ath9k_set_coverage_class` function in the `ath9k/main.c` file.

4. Inside the function, the `ath9k_ps_wakeup` function is called before `ath9k_hw_init_global_settings`, and `ath9k_ps_restore` is called after it. These functions are responsible for handling power-saving states.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to power-saving wrappers in the ath9k driver. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or if it causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would recommend further investigation or clarification before deciding whether to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to lockdep annotations in the kernfs_deactivate() function. The issue causes uninitialized lockdep_map to be fed to lockdep, triggering warnings and potentially leading to unexpected behavior. This can be considered a "real and critical bug" as it can cause system instability.

The patch itself adds checks to ensure that lockdep annotations are performed only if the KERNFS_LOCKDEP flag is set. This ensures that the lockdep_map is properly initialized before being used.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a failure to open PCM device with -ENOSYS in Terratec Phase 88. This indicates that there is a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the device.

2. The patch addresses the issue by correcting the IDs for the Selector Function Blocks in the current implementation. The correct IDs are 9 and 8, but they are currently set to 0 and 0.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" and "Tested-by" tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by a user, which adds credibility to the fix.

4. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases (Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v3.16+), suggesting that it is considered important enough to be backported to stable versions of the Linux kernel.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug in the Terratec Phase 88 device and meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that allowed PCH PWM override on IVB (Ivy Bridge) hardware. The reason for the revert is that it breaks the backlight controls on an Asus Zenbook with an eDP panel.

Given that this patch is reverting a change that introduced a regression, it is likely a critical bug fix. The issue of broken backlight controls can be considered a "real and critical bug" that affects functionality. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing unlock on the error handle path in the `net2272_irq()` function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue in the memremap's helper function try_ram_remap(). It mentions that a struct page pointer is dereferenced, which is derived from a PFN (Page Frame Number) known to be covered by a 'System RAM' iomem region.

2. The assumption made in the code is that there is a 1:1 relation between the System RAM iomem region and the kernel direct mapping. However, this assumption is not universally valid on all architectures, specifically on ARM and arm64, where 'System RAM' may include regions for which pfn_valid() returns false.

3. The patch proposes adding a check to ensure that pfn_valid() returns true before calling pfn_to_page() in the try_ram_remap() function.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue where the assumption of a 1:1 relation between System RAM and the kernel direct mapping is not valid on certain architectures. By adding the pfn_valid() check, the code ensures that only valid PFNs/physical addresses are used with pfn_to_page() and __va().

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough analysis would require reviewing the code in its entirety and considering any potential side effects or interactions with other parts of the kernel.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to initialize the checksum field when using checksum offloading in the MACB/GEM driver. It addresses an issue where UDP packets with a payload size less than or equal to 2 may contain incorrect checksums on Zynq.

2. Changes Made:
   - The patch no longer blindly modifies SKB contents based on legitimate objections.
   - Disabling HW checksum offload for Zynq has been dropped.
   - The checksum is initialized similar to net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch introduces a new inline function `macb_clear_csum` to handle checksum initialization.
   - The function checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled. If not, it returns without making any changes.
   - It ensures that the packet header can be modified by calling `skb_cow_head` if necessary.
   - The checksum field is then initialized to 0 using a pointer arithmetic operation.
   - In the `macb_start_xmit` function, the `macb_clear_csum` function is called before mapping the socket buffer for DMA transfer.
   - If `macb_clear_csum` returns an error, the packet is freed, and `NETDEV_TX_OK` is returned.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to incorrect checksums on Zynq for UDP packets with a small payload. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses the issue of association hangs due to errors when reneging events from the ordering queue in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation.

The patch modifies the function `sctp_ulpq_renege_list()` in the `net/sctp/ulpqueue.c` file. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch introduces two new variables, `last_tsn` and `last`, to keep track of the last TSN (Transmission Sequence Number) and the last fragment of the event, respectively.

2. The patch adds a loop to iterate over all fragments of the event in the ordering queue. It sums the total freed space and finds the last TSN by traversing the fragment list.

3. The event is unlinked from the list, and the memory is freed using `sctp_ulpevent_free()`.

4. The patch introduces a new loop to renege all applicable TSNs from the TSN map. It iterates from the current TSN to the last TSN, calling `sctp_tsnmap_renege()` for each TSN.

5. If the total freed space is greater than or equal to the needed space, the function returns the total freed space.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses an issue with zero padding of tx push data in the bnxt_en driver.

2. The patch correctly identifies that the arithmetic used for zero padding the last 64-bit word in the push buffer is incorrect.

3. The first change in the patch suggests using `pdata + length` to reach the end of the buffer. This change appears to be a correct fix for the issue.

4. The second change in the patch suggests passing `end` (a u64 pointer) to `PTR_ALIGN()` instead of `pdata`. This change ensures that the aligned pointer minus one is the last 64-bit pointer to data. This change also seems to be a valid fix.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by lines, indicating the authors and their email addresses.

6. The patch modifies the `bnxt_start_xmit()` function in the `bnxt.c` file.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the InfiniBand SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch checks if the target is not connected or if the QP (Queue Pair) is in an error state before sending a task management function. If either condition is true, the function returns -1, indicating that the task management function should not be sent.

   This check ensures that a task management function is not sent needlessly, which can help avoid unnecessary failures.

2. The patch also removes a check for the QP being in an error state in the `srp_reset_device` function. This check is no longer necessary since the same condition is already checked in the `srp_send_tsk_mgmt` function.

   Removing this redundant check simplifies the code and improves readability.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue by avoiding the unnecessary sending of a task management function when it is likely to fail anyway. Additionally, it removes redundant code, improving code clarity.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch, and further review and testing may be required before final acceptance.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems ends up with default values due to incomplete initialization. It allows the panel's preferred mode to override the native mode if the resolutions don't match. Systems without a valid internal panel EDID will still use the BIOS native mode.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_connectors.c`. It adds code to check if the EDID preferred mode matches the native mode and replaces the native mode with the preferred mode if the resolutions don't match.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific corner case where the BIOS native mode may not accurately represent the panel capabilities. By allowing the panel's preferred mode to override the native mode, it ensures that the panel's capabilities are correctly reflected. This can prevent issues such as incorrect resolutions or display problems.

   The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes, spelling changes, or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on resolving a potential issue related to panel capabilities.

4. Impact:
   The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses a situation that can lead to incorrect display behavior, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "spi-topcliff-pch: Fix SSN Control issue" and it states that during processing 1 command/data series, the SSN (Slave Select Negation) signal should remain LOW, but it currently becomes HIGH. The patch aims to fix this issue.

2. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating the authors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. In the code changes, a new constant `SSN_HIGH` is defined with a value of `0x03U`. This suggests that the SSN signal should be set to HIGH.

4. In the `pch_spi_set_ir` function, the code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is removed. This means that the control over SSN is no longer explicitly set to NO_CONTROL.

5. In the `pch_spi_start_transfer` function, the same code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is also removed.

6. In the `pch_spi_process_messages` function, the code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is added before the main loop. This ensures that the SSN control is set to NO_CONTROL at the beginning of each message processing.

7. At the end of the `pch_spi_process_messages` function, the code that writes `SSN_HIGH` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is added. This sets the SSN signal to HIGH after all messages have been processed.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses an issue related to the SSN control in the spi-topcliff-pch driver. The changes made in the patch aim to ensure that the SSN signal is properly controlled during command/data series processing.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to fallocate requests in the fuse filesystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch updates the inode size after a successful fallocate request. This ensures that the inode size reflects the correct value after the file has been extended. This fix addresses a potential issue with file size calculation.

2. The patch also invalidates the inode attributes after a successful fallocate request. This ensures that the latest attribute values, such as i_blocks, are picked up correctly. This fix addresses a potential issue with attribute caching.

3. The patch includes additional code to handle the case where the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag is not set. In this case, the patch updates the inode size to reflect the extended file size correctly. This fix ensures that the inode size is updated when necessary.

4. The patch also includes code to handle the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag. If this flag is set, the patch truncates the page cache range for the affected file. This fix ensures that the page cache is correctly updated when punching holes in the file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses real and critical issues related to fallocate requests in the fuse filesystem. It fixes potential bugs that could lead to incorrect file size calculation, attribute caching issues, and incorrect page cache updates. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug introduced by a previous commit (bc3f02a795d3b4faa99d37390174be2a75d091bd) that was intended to fix a reported soft lockup issue.
2. The bug causes an endless loop when dropping a lock while iterating a list, potentially leading to a hang.

4. The patch includes a reference to a reported issue (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1348679) and acknowledges that the soft lockup problem has been fixed by a subsequent commit (f2495e228fce9f9cec84367547813cbb0d6db15a).
5. The patch has been reviewed and tested by Johannes Thumshirn, adding credibility to its effectiveness.
6. The patch is signed-off by Christoph Hellwig and James Bottomley, indicating their approval.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to a hang. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to propagate the error code from failing to unregister a conflicting fb driver to avoid kernel panics.
2. The function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` is modified to return an integer value instead of being void. This allows the function to propagate the error code.
3. The function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` now checks the return value of `do_unregister_framebuffer` and returns it if it is non-zero.
4. The function `do_register_framebuffer` also checks the return value of `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and returns it if it is non-zero.
5. The function `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` in `fbmem.c` is modified to return an integer value instead of being void. This allows the function to propagate the error code.
6. The header file `fb.h` is updated to reflect the changes in the function signatures.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a real issue related to conflicting fb drivers and aims to prevent kernel panics. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a specific bug related to a NULL pointer dereference when loading the cx88_dvb module for a Hauppauge HVR4000. The patch checks whether the module was actually loaded, which is a safer approach. 

The bug has been reported in the bugzilla.kernel.org and has been signed-off by the relevant developers. 

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a NULL pointer dereference, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical issue: The inability to allocate memory for RTAS (Run-Time Abstraction Services) can lead to various failures, including SMT threads, storage, and network issues.

2. The patch introduces a proactive approach: Instead of allowing the system to continue running with potential failures, it triggers a panic upfront if RTAS exists and memory allocation fails. This ensures that any potential issues are immediately identified and prevents further damage or unpredictable behavior.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It focuses on a specific and critical issue, without any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

4. The patch is signed-off by two recognized contributors: Anton Blanchard and Benjamin Herrenschmidt, indicating that it has undergone review and testing by experienced individuals.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix an issue related to the completion of the Control write status stage in the renesas_usbhs driver. The patch prevents the incorrect clearing of PID_BUF in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop() function, which can cause the controller to be unable to complete the status stage.

Considering that this issue can lead to a failure in completing an important stage of the control write process, it can be categorized as a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a potential functional problem that could impact the stability and reliability of the system.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file.

The purpose of the cond_resched() call was to allow scheduling in non-atomic contexts during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy(). However, it was found that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy() is called in atomic context, making scheduling not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386.

The patch argues that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration, it is still better than using cond_resched() to cover only non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). The patch removes the cond_resched() call, which was added to allow scheduling in non-atomic contexts. While it may be true that scheduling is not possible in atomic contexts on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, it is still important to consider other architectures where this patch may have unintended consequences.

It is crucial to thoroughly test the patch on all relevant architectures and configurations to ensure that it does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Additionally, the patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect comparison in the powernow_k6_cpu_exit() function in the powernow-k6 driver. The value of 'max_multiplier' is meant to be compared with clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself.

2. The patch also updates the for-loop condition in powernow_k6_cpu_exit() to look for CPUFREQ_TABLE_END instead of hard-coding the loop count to 8.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a bug in the powernow-k6 driver that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior. The bug fix does not appear to be trivial, as it involves correcting a comparison and updating the loop condition.

Considering that the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to handle errors correctly in the `rtc_irq_set_state()` function.

2. The code checks the correctness of the parameters but unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer.

3. The issue with the current implementation is that a random task might arm/disarm the rtc timer, surprising the real owner by either generating events or stopping them.

4. The patch adds an error handling mechanism by introducing a label `out` and a `goto` statement to handle errors appropriately.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue that could potentially cause unexpected behavior and surprises for the owner of the rtc timer. It also introduces a proper error handling mechanism.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a backport of changes made to the x86 page fault handler for making it retryable and killable. The patch aims to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation on 64-bit sparc.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to address a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch do not directly relate to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues mentioned in the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current vfio-pci code incorrectly checks the device type using the PCI_HEADER_TYPE value, which is actually an offset in the configuration space. This mistake can lead to incorrect behavior.

2. The patch fixes the issue by directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type instead of using the incorrect value. This ensures that only normal PCI devices are supported, as intended.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch is also marked for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause incorrect behavior in vfio-pci. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c) in the "drm/i915" driver.

2. The reason for reverting the commit is that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

3. The original patch is described as "complete non-sense" since the WARNING backtraces in the referenced bugzilla are about "gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits" mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

4. The patch includes changes in the "intel_lvds.c" and "intel_panel.c" files.

5. In the "intel_lvds.c" file, the patch adds code to set the "8to6 dither" flag in the "gmch_pfit.control" field if the hardware is gen2/3.

6. In the "intel_panel.c" file, the patch adds code to set the "8to6 dither" flag in the "gmch_pfit.control" field if the hardware is pre-965 and the panel bpp is 18.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a real issue related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware and pre-965 hardware with 18bpp panels. The lack of dithering has been reported by multiple users, indicating that it is a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to dithering on specific hardware configurations.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of level interrupts in the KVM virtualization subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the `vgic_v3_fold_lr_state` function in the `vgic-v3.c` file.

2. The patch introduces changes to the handling of level interrupts in the `vgic_v3_fold_lr_state` function.

3. Previously, the code cleared the soft pending state when level interrupts were acknowledged and not pending in the list register.

4. The patch modifies this behavior and ensures that the line level is always resampled, regardless of the state in the list register.

5. The patch also updates the pending state to consider both the line level and the soft pending state.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of level interrupts in the KVM virtualization subsystem. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces changes to the logic and behavior of the code.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to the injection of spurious interrupts, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. The patch removes the resource check before calling `devm_ioremap_resource` in multiple drivers. Since `devm_ioremap_resource` already performs sanity checks on the given resource, the resource checks in the drivers are unnecessary.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a build error caused by a conflict with the identifier "ffs" in the code. The patch converts the "ffs" macro from an object-like macro to a function-like macro to avoid this conflict.

Since the patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improvements. It is a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to restarting the device and handling requests to stop transmission aggregation (Tx agg) in the iwlwifi driver. 

The patch checks if the device is being restarted and, if so, ignores requests from mac80211 to stop Tx agg while reconfiguring the device. This is because when the device is restarted, all the Rx/Tx Block Ack (BA) sessions are wiped out by the driver. The patch also mentions that stopping a non-existing Rx BA session is harmless, so it honors mac80211's request.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or handling of a non-critical scenario.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds locking using zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, preventing invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other critical problems. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the handling of the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit in the usbnet_stop() function. The patch ensures that the value of EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM is read before it is cleared when dev->flags is set to 0.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the correct handling of the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it ensures the correct behavior of the code.

However, without further context or information about the impact of this issue, it is difficult to determine the severity of the problem and whether it qualifies as critical. Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the information provided, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), as it addresses a specific issue and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, it would be beneficial to have more information about the impact and severity of the problem to make a more informed decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to antenna selection when Bluetooth (BT) is active. The bug caused the wrong antenna to be chosen, which could lead to connectivity issues on single antenna devices like the 3160. The patch addresses this issue by correcting the antenna selection code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause connectivity problems on certain devices. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a list corruption issue in urb dequeue at host removal in the xhci driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential bug.

2. The patch description explains that the xhci driver frees data for all devices, including td_list and xhci_ring structures, when usb_remove_hcd() is called for the first time. However, when usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus, it tries to dequeue all pending urbs and accesses td_list, which has already been freed for that endpoint. This indicates a potential issue that could lead to list corruption.

3. The patch includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

4. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue() function in the xhci.c file. It adds a condition to the for loop, checking if xhci->devs[urb->dev->slot_id] is valid before continuing the loop. This change ensures that the loop only iterates when the device is valid, preventing access to freed memory.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to list corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. However, it's important to note that the final decision should be made by the Linux kernel maintainers.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the wiimote driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds status and return request handlers for the wiimote driver. This indicates that it addresses a specific issue related to handling status reports and return reports from the wiimote.

2. The patch mentions that the wiimote resets the current drm when an extension is plugged in. To keep the drm consistent, the patch resets the drm on every status report.

3. The patch also handles return reports from the wiimote, indicating the success or failure of requests sent.

4. The patch includes the necessary function definitions for handling status and return reports.

5. The patch adds the appropriate entries for the status and return request handlers in the `handlers` array.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to the wiimote driver and adds necessary functionality to handle status and return reports. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functionality and handles specific scenarios.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to the wiimote driver and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug reported by Chris Metcalf, where sched_can_stop_tick() sometimes fails to re-enable the tick.

2. The patch fixes the issue where rq->cfs.nr_running can be 1 even though there are multiple runnable CFS tasks, which can happen in the cgroup case.

3. The patch also identifies a problem with the assumption that if there are FIFO tasks, those will run. It correctly points out that the FIFO task can have a lower priority than an RR task, in which case the RR task will run. The patch suggests moving the fifo_nr_running test after the rr_nr_running tests.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and credits the original reporter and tester of the bug.

5. The patch provides a link to the original report and references the commit it fixes.

6. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including maintainers and developers.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug and has undergone proper review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to qeth (QDIO Ethernet) devices on the s390 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of blkt (block size) changes being reset during online setting due to a second invocation of qeth_determine_capabilities().

2. The patch ensures that blkt default values are configured only during the first run of qeth_determine_capabilities(). This change allows blkt changes to be kept during online setting.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and the reported-by tag from the person who reported the issue.

4. The code change itself is relatively small and focused, modifying the qeth_determine_capabilities() function in the qeth_core_main.c file.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to blkt changes being reset during online setting for qeth devices. While it does not explicitly mention any critical issues like build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities, it does fix an issue that could potentially cause unexpected behavior or configuration inconsistencies.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is always important to consider the broader context and potential implications of the patch before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The current implementation of dev_pm_domain_set() triggers false-positive warnings when attempting to clear the pm_domain pointer after invoking the driver's ->remove() callback.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. It states that the WARN_ON() triggers on attempts to clear the pointer as well, leading to false-positive warnings.

3. The fix is straightforward and does not introduce any trivial changes. It suggests modifying the dev_pm_domain_set() function to check if the pointer passed to it is NULL and skip the warning in that case.

4. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the issue.

5. It also includes the "Tested-by" tags from multiple individuals, indicating that the patch has been tested and verified by them.

6. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Ulf Hansson, which adds credibility to its correctness.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is described as a hardening fix, specifically requiring read access for controlling terminal. It mentions that write-only access to other users' ttys is usually only given through setgid tty executables.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `tty_open` function and the `tiocsctty` function in the `tty_io.c` file.

   In the `tty_open` function:
   - It adds a check to prevent a process with write-only access to the tty from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal.
   - It checks if the file mode (`f_mode`) of the file pointer (`filp`) includes read access (`FMODE_READ`). If it does, the `__proc_set_tty` function is called to set the tty for the process.
   - It includes a comment mentioning that this change could potentially break old code that performs open() on a write-only file descriptor, and suggests permitting it if `inode_permission(inode, MAY_READ) == 0`.

   In the `tiocsctty` function:
   - It adds a check similar to the one in `tty_open` to prevent a process with write-only access to the tty from setting it as the controlling terminal.
   - It checks if the file mode (`f_mode`) of the file pointer (`file`) includes read access (`FMODE_READ`). If it does not and the process does not have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, it returns `-EPERM` to indicate a permission error.

3. Analysis:
   The patch aims to prevent processes with write-only access to a tty from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. This is done to address potential security issues where write-only access could be abused to gain unintended privileges.

   The changes in the `tty_open` function ensure that only processes with read access to the tty can set it as the controlling terminal. The additional check for `inode_permission(inode, MAY_READ) == 0` suggests that if a process performs open() on a write-only file descriptor, it may still be permitted if it has no read permission.

   The changes in the `tiocsctty` function prevent a process with write-only access to the tty from setting it as the controlling terminal, unless the process has the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, the patch addresses a potential security issue by enforcing read access for controlling terminals. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces logic to prevent unintended privileges. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves managing the WM8731 ACTIVE bit as a supply widget. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any significant changes other than adding a supply widget and removing some unused code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to truncating a file in the overlay filesystem (overlayfs). It introduces a check for write access on the underlying inode before performing the truncation. This check is done both on the lower file (before copy-up) and the upper file (after copy-up) for consistency.

The patch also includes a test case to verify the fix, which checks if truncating a file that should fail actually returns the expected error code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to truncating files in overlayfs, ensuring proper write access checks.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues. It is more of a correctness and consistency improvement.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a necessary check for write access.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although it does not address a critical issue, it improves the correctness and consistency of the overlayfs filesystem.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a mislabeled USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) in the ftdi_sio driver.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the removal of local routes when a network device goes down. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description explains that when `fib_netdev_event` calls `fib_disable_ip` on the `NETDEV_DOWN` event, it should not delete the local routes if the local address is still present. This indicates that there is a bug causing the deletion of local routes even when the local address is still valid.

2. The patch includes a fix by introducing a new parameter `force` to the `fib_disable_ip` function. This parameter is used to control whether the local routes should be deleted or not. By passing `true` to `fib_disable_ip` when the last address is removed, the local routes will be deleted. Otherwise, when the network device goes down but the local address is still present, the local routes will not be deleted.

3. The patch modifies the function signature of `fib_sync_down_dev` to include the new `force` parameter. This change ensures that the `force` parameter is correctly propagated to the `fib_disable_ip` function.

4. The patch also includes some comments explaining the different events and their corresponding `force` values. This clarifies the intended behavior of the `force` parameter in different scenarios.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The previous check for disk capacity assumed that it was reported in units of 512 bytes, which may not be the case. This can lead to incorrect capacity calculations.

2. The patch introduces a new sanity check function named `sd_addressable_capacity` to ensure that the reported capacity can be expressed in terms of `sector_t`. This function calculates the last sector based on the logical block size and checks if it exceeds the maximum value of `sector_t` when `CONFIG_LBDAF` is not set.

3. The patch modifies the `read_capacity_16` and `read_capacity_10` functions to use the new `sd_addressable_capacity` function instead of the previous check. If the reported capacity exceeds the addressable range, an error message is printed.

4. The patch includes proper attribution to the original reporter and reviewers, as well as a signed-off-by statement from the patch author.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch modifies the mlx5e_route_lookup_ipv4 function in the en_tc.c file.
4. It introduces a new variable, "esw," which represents the mlx5_eswitch structure.
5. The patch checks if the egress device is on the same HW e-switch. If not, it uses the uplink device obtained from the eswitch service function.
6. If the egress device is on the same HW e-switch, it uses the original device.
7. The patch also removes the warning message that was previously printed when the devices were not on the same HW e-switch.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a specific use-case related to tunneling with upper devices. It does not introduce any trivial changes and does not seem to have any negative impact on the existing functionality. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to fix a warning triggered by the -Wstringop-overflow flag introduced in GCC 7. This warning is caused by the declaration of "empty_zero_page" in arch/sparc/include/setup.h. The patch aligns the declaration of "empty_zero_page" to that of other architectures.

Looking at the changes made by the patch, it seems to be addressing a coding style issue rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The warning itself does not indicate a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue.

3. The bug affects the UEFI memory attributes table code: The crash occurs when processing the EFI Memory Attributes table, which suggests a specific scenario where the bug manifests.

4. The patch fixes the bug by adding a call to pgtable_page_ctor(): This ensures that the per-page spinlock is properly initialized for the allocated PTE pages.

5. The patch is targeted at the UEFI subsystem: It specifically addresses the issue related to UEFI page tables, which indicates that it is a targeted fix for a specific subsystem.

6. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Based on these points, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause an oops and data corruption in a specific scenario involving UEFI page tables.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to changing the MTU when using per-cpu processing in the mvneta driver. The issue causes blocking of all port's interrupts and prevents transmitting data after the MTU change under heavy load.

The patch addresses the problem by disabling percpu interrupts during the reconfiguration of TXQs and RXQs. It introduces two new functions, `mvneta_percpu_enable` and `mvneta_percpu_disable`, which respectively enable and disable percpu interrupts for the mvneta port.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a critical issue that can lead to data transmission problems, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption or loss.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore (hyperv_mmio_lock) to lock access to the hyperv_mmio resource tree.
2. The resource tree is created in single-threaded code and is not modified after creation. Therefore, it does not require locking in the existing code.
3. However, other patches in the series introduce runtime modifications to the resource tree, which can occur on multiple threads. Hence, the introduction of the semaphore is necessary to ensure thread safety.
4. The patch includes the necessary locking and unlocking operations using the down() and up() functions respectively.
5. The patch also handles the return value of the request_mem_region_exclusive() function and sets the retval variable accordingly.
6. The patch uses the retval variable to determine the return value of the vmbus_allocate_mmio() function.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential concurrency issue by introducing locking for the resource tree access. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is focused on fixing a real and critical bug related to thread safety. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a regression in the Linux kernel related to the treatment of drm_vblank_offdelay in the drm_vblank_on() function. The regression caused a user-specified value of zero to be overridden by the kms driver setting vblank_disable_immediate to true.

The patch aims to fix this regression and keep the user in control. It ensures that vblanks are only reenabled if there are clients left or if the user has requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0.

Considering the patch addresses a regression and restores the intended behavior, it appears to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to audio playback on Kirkwood / OpenRD client. The error message suggests that the machine hw_params failed with an unknown error code.

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of tty_wait_until_sent may take up to twice as long as the requested timeout while waiting for driver and hardware buffers to drain. This can lead to unexpected delays and potentially impact system performance.

2. The patch fixes the bug by taking the remaining number of jiffies (time units used by the kernel) into account after waiting for driver buffers to drain. This ensures that the timeout actually becomes a maximum timeout as documented.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Johan Hovold, Peter Hurley, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the critical bug.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to pid allocation in a pid namespace when the init process dies. The bug can lead to processes attempting to access their child reaper and following a stale pointer. Additionally, the patch avoids problems where waitpid for init can return before all processes in the pid namespace have exited.

The patch modifies the following files:
- include/linux/pid.h
- include/linux/pid_namespace.h
- kernel/pid.c
- kernel/pid_namespace.c

The changes include adding a new function `disable_pid_allocation` in `pid.h` and modifying the `struct pid_namespace` in `pid_namespace.h` to include a new flag `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING`. In `pid.c`, the `free_pid` function is modified to schedule work when the process is exiting, and the `alloc_pid` function is modified to check if pid allocation is disabled before proceeding. In `pid_namespace.c`, the `create_pid_namespace` function is modified to set the `nr_hashed` flag to `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING`, and the `zap_pid_ns_processes` function is modified to disable further pid allocation.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug related to pid allocation in a pid namespace and avoids potential issues with accessing stale pointers.

The bug causes a stale radar_required field, which can prevent the initiation of new scan requests. The patch addresses this issue by clearing the radar_required field when ieee80211_vif_use_channel() fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a critical bug that can impact the functionality of the system and does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real and critical issue related to a corrupted file system. The patch introduces a new function called `ext4_iget_normal()` which is used for directory tree lookups. This function prohibits the use of directory entries that point at reserved, metadata inodes, similar to how Boot Loader inodes are treated. These reserved inodes are marked as bad inodes, preventing them from being opened, deleted, or modified.

The patch also includes changes in the `ext4_lookup()`, `ext4_get_parent()`, and `ext4_nfs_get_inode()` functions to use the new `ext4_iget_normal()` function instead of the existing `ext4_iget()` function.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to data corruption and ensures the proper handling of reserved inodes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the UBI driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the active state on the GIC distributor in a preemptible section. This bug could potentially lead to setting the active state on a different physical CPU than the one intended, causing issues.

The patch addresses this issue by moving the timer flush into a non-preemptible section, ensuring that the active state is set correctly. The change is reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. Additionally, the fix does not appear to contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The failure path in ibmvnic_open() mistakenly calls napi_enable instead of napi_disable. This can lead to a BUG_ON for any queues that were enabled in the previous call to napi_enable. This bug can potentially cause a hang or data corruption, making it a critical issue.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The patch addresses a specific issue related to enabling and disabling NAPI queues. It does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The change from napi_enable to napi_disable in the failure path is a straightforward fix that addresses the bug without introducing any new issues.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of the bug and the absence of trivial changes, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to prevent timeline updates while performing a reset in the DRM/i915 driver.

2. The patch fixes a potential issue where the list of requests on the timeline could be modified concurrently as it is being traversed.

3. The fix involves taking both the context's timeline lock and the global timeline lock to prevent modifications during traversal.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes to implement the fix.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other undesirable behavior.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a situation where the mac80211 state machine gets confused due to a failure in scheduling the CSA (Channel Switch Announcement) time event. This confusion can lead to issues with maintaining a working connection.

The patch proposes disconnecting in this case, as it is not robust to try to keep the connection up when the CSA time event fails. This approach ensures the stability and reliability of the wireless connection.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue: It addresses an accidental enablement of the ramp delay for buck4 in the s2mpa01 regulator driver. This issue occurs when ramp delay is set for bucks that do not support enable/disable (buck[56789] and buck10).

2. The issue is real and critical: The accidental enablement of the ramp delay for buck4 can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially cause system instability or data corruption.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-critical modifications.

4. The patch includes relevant Fixes and Signed-off-by tags: It references the commit that introduced the issue and includes the necessary sign-offs from the authors and reviewers.

5. The patch applies the fix conditionally: It checks if the regulator is within the range of buck[1234] before enabling the ramp delay. This ensures that the fix is only applied to the relevant regulators.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (1414abea048e0835c43600d62808ed8163897227) that restricted the Virtual Function (VF) from configuring any VLAN mode. Reverting this commit allows any VLAN to be configured from the VF.

2. The reason for reverting the commit is to enable the use of the same multicast address with any VLAN instead of programming separate (MAC, VLAN) tuples in the adapter. This is intended to save some multicast filters.

3. The patch removes the definitions for QLC_MAC_STAR_ADD and QLC_MAC_STAR_DEL, which were previously used to check if MAC + any VLAN filter is allowed from the VF.

4. The patch also removes the check for MAC + any VLAN filter not being allowed from the VF. This check was present in the qlcnic_sriov_validate_cfg_macvlan function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is removing important checks and restrictions related to MAC + any VLAN filter configuration from the VF. This could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities or other issues related to VLAN configuration. Therefore, it is not recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || To analyze the patch, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The patch disables PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. This is because if the default PM Domain using PM_CLK is used for PM runtime, the real Clock Domain cannot be registered from DT later.

2. The patch replaces explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT for most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms (SH-Mobile, R-Mobile, R-Car, RZ). This simplifies the platform logic.

3. Backwards-compatibility with old DTs (mainly for R-Car Gen2) is provided by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

4. The default PM Domain is still needed for backwards-compatibility with old DTs that lack PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy (non-DT) ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support (r8a7778, r8a7779), and legacy SuperH.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to PM runtime management for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. It also provides backwards-compatibility and simplifies the platform logic.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to PM runtime and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The commit being reverted is 23c405912b88.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it should not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

In this case, the patch is reverting a previous fix for a memory leak. Memory leaks can be considered critical issues as they can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the memory leak and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Considering the lack of additional context and the fact that the patch does not provide any new fixes or improvements, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. Therefore, I would recommend further analysis and evaluation by the Linux kernel maintainers to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the release of the MMC host after a discard operation. The patch addresses a potential bug where the MMC request data structure may be freed in memory, causing the check of req->cmd_flags & MMC_REQ_SPECIAL_MASK to be dangerous and invalid.

The patch marks the special request down before the discard/flush operation, ensuring that the MMC host is released when it should be. It also includes appropriate acknowledgments and review information.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a bug related to obj->map_and_fenceable computation in the drm/i915 driver. The bug was exposed by a previous commit that attempted to fix an oversight in handling obj->map_and_fenceable. The patch proposes unbinding from the global GTT if the object is currently fenceable but will not be after the tiling change.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to obj->map_and_fenceable computation, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but based on the context, it seems that the bug can potentially cause incorrect behavior or unexpected results, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch focuses on fixing the bug and does not include any trivial changes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the mvneta driver. It removes the direct call to mvneta_adjust_link() from the mvneta_ioctl() function and instead relies on the callback mechanism provided by of_phy_connect(). 

Calling mvneta_adjust_link() directly is incorrect because it is intended to be called as a callback from of_phy_connect(). By removing this direct call, the patch ensures that the function is called in the correct context and avoids any potential issues that may arise from calling it manually.

The change itself is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only removes the direct call and returns the result of phy_mii_ioctl() directly.

Since the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for a firmware issue in the igb i210 NIC. The patch adds an additional zeroing of the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register during the igb_get_phy_id function to address the problem.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch addresses a firmware issue that can cause the probe of the igb i210 NIC to fail. While it may not directly cause any of the mentioned critical issues, a failed probe can lead to system instability or loss of network connectivity, which can be considered a critical bug.

Regarding the trivial fixes, the patch does not appear to contain any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It specifically adds the necessary code to zero the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register for the i210 NIC.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the enabling of the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt in the ravb driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. 

However, without additional context or information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. 

If the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt is not being handled properly and causing critical issues such as data corruption or system instability, then removing the enabling of this interrupt could potentially be a valid fix. In such a case, the patch may be considered for inclusion in a stable release.

On the other hand, if the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt is not causing any critical issues or if it is expected behavior that does not require handling, then removing the enabling of this interrupt may not be necessary. In this case, the patch may not be suitable for inclusion in a stable release.

To make a more informed decision, it would be helpful to have additional information about the bug or issue that this patch is addressing and its impact on the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to releasing overlays in the OMAPFB driver. The patch ensures that overlays are properly removed from overlay managers, preventing a crash when omapfb is unbound and bound or when the omapfb module is removed and loaded while keeping omapdss around.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a crash. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The "End of Table" entry (type 127) is not handled properly after adding initial SMBIOS v3 support. This can lead to the entry not being created in the dmi sysfs, causing the size of the DMI table to be incorrect.

2. The patch fixes a potential data corruption issue: The size of the DMI table must correspond to the sum of all DMI entry sizes. By moving the end-of-table check after it's handled by dmi_table, the correct size calculation is ensured.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It focuses on addressing the specific bug and does not include any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals: It has been reviewed by Ard Biesheuvel and signed-off by Ivan Khoronzhuk and Matt Fleming, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a small race condition between `copy_process()` and `cgroup_attach_task()`, where `child->se.parent` and `cfs_rq` may point to invalid (old) ones.
2. The race condition can lead to a "use-after-free" scenario and potentially cause a panic.
3. The bug has been previously observed and caused a panic in RHEL6.4.
4. The patch includes a fix that ensures the `se.parent` and `cfs_rq` of the child point to valid ones by calling `__set_task_cpu()` after the copy.
5. The patch is signed-off by the relevant contributors and has been reviewed.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the potential for data corruption and panics, it is recommended to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that can lead to a panic at kfree in mei_release(). The bug occurs when mei_cl_read_start() fails to send a flow control request and releases "cl->read_cb" without setting it to NULL. This leaves "cl->read_cb" pointing to random memory, which can cause issues when the client is operated later.

The patch fixes this bug by setting "cl->read_cb" to NULL before releasing it. This ensures that the pointer is not left pointing to invalid memory.

Considering that the bug can lead to a panic and the patch addresses the issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a panic, which meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue with the error passive level test in the pch_can driver.
2. The current test (((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) > 127) is incorrect because the receive error counter ((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) is at most 127, making the test always false.
3. The patch suggests using the RP bit (15) to test whether the receive error counter has reached the error passive level.
4. The patch includes the necessary changes to define PCH_RP as 0x00008000 and uses it in the error passive level test.
5. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Wolfgang Grandegger <wg@grandegger.com>.
6. The patch has been signed-off by Xi Wang <xi.wang@gmail.com> and Marc Kleine-Budde <mkl@pengutronix.de>.

Considering the patch fixes a real bug in the pch_can driver and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a regression introduced by commit 2febcdf84b, which caused the inability to mount the ubifs created by the old NAND ECC layout. This bug can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The patch reverts to the legacy ECC layout, which is necessary to fix the regression. It does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The patch reverts to the previous behavior, which was known to be working correctly. Therefore, it does not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reviewed and Acked-by two developers, Huang Shijie and Marek Vasut. Additionally, it has been tested by Marek Vasut.

Based on these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the regression and ensure the correct functioning of the ubifs.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The transfer hangs during I2C frame transmission with certain devices.

2. The patch reduces the internal frequency of the TWI IP, which resolves the issue. It is mentioned that oversampling on I2C signals makes the TWI believe that a transfer in progress is done.

3. The fix does not impact the I2C bus frequency, indicating that it does not introduce any new issues.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Wolfram Sang and Jean-Christophe PLAGNIOL-VILLARD.

5. The patch is signed-off by Ludovic Desroches and Nicolas Ferre, indicating their responsibility for the changes.

6. The patch modifies the clock dividers for the TWI peripherals, reducing the internal clock frequency from AT91_PMC_PCR_DIV2 to AT91_PMC_PCR_DIV8.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The code is confused between a PHY and a generic MDIO device due to the presence of a compatible value in some PHY nodes.

2. The patch fixes the issue by adding a whitelist of PHY compatibilities and issuing a warning if a compatible value known on the whitelist is found.

3. The patch includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported and tested the issue.

4. The patch is signed-off by two maintainers, indicating their approval.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change existing behavior, but rather improves the code's clarity and correctness.

Therefore, considering the criticality of the issue and the appropriate fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to information leakage in the L2CAP code of the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch initializes the `l2_bdaddr_type` member of `struct sockaddr_l2` and the padding byte for alignment, which prevents the leakage of two bytes of kernel stack memory via the `getsockname()` syscall.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information disclosure, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue in the reiserfs filesystem. The patch addresses the problem of not freeing the commit workqueue when mount fails, which can lead to resource leaks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch meets the requirements. It fixes a critical bug that can cause resource leaks and potential issues with the reiserfs filesystem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a regression caused by a previous patch that reverted code necessary for handling dirty pages. The regression caused issues when the lower file was closed before the dirty pages were written out. 

The patch proposes a better approach to ensure that the lower file is still open when writing out the dirty pages. It calls the function `filemap_write_and_wait()` from `ecryptfs_release()` just before the lower file is closed. This ensures that the dirty pages are written out before the final `fput()` and pointer overwrite.

Considering that this patch addresses a regression and fixes a critical issue related to dirty pages not being properly written out, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a generic quirk for matching Insyde devices in the bytcr_rt5640 driver. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical issue: The current limitation of setting the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of vxlan devices without an underlying device to a maximum of 1500 is arbitrary and prevents the use of larger MTU values, such as jumbo frames.

2. The patch relaxes the MTU constraints for vxlan devices without an underlying device, allowing them to be set to larger values based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead.

3. The default MTU remains 1500 for compatibility, ensuring that existing configurations are not affected.

4. The patch modifies the `vxlan_change_mtu` function to include a new helper function `__vxlan_change_mtu` that takes into account the lower device's MTU and adjusts the maximum MTU accordingly.

5. The patch also introduces a new parameter `strict` to `__vxlan_change_mtu`, which allows for a more flexible behavior when setting the MTU. If `strict` is set to true, the function returns an error if the requested MTU exceeds the maximum allowed. If `strict` is set to false, the function adjusts the requested MTU to the maximum allowed value.

6. The patch includes proper sign-offs and acknowledgments from relevant contributors.

Based on the above analysis, this patch addresses a real issue, improves functionality, and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The bug causes a build error: The warning message indicates a failure during the registration of the video device.

3. The patch fixes the bug by setting the v4l2_dev field, which is expected by the commit mentioned in the patch description.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It addresses a specific issue related to the G2D driver and its registration process.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and ensure proper functionality of the G2D driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a data corruption issue that occurs when changing serial settings on some PL2303 devices, even if the settings are the same as before.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: The patch ensures that bytes are not lost when changing serial settings, preventing potential data corruption.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve comparing and configuring the device's settings.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone proper review and testing.

5. The patch includes appropriate documentation: The patch includes a clear description of the problem and the solution, making it easier for future maintainers to understand and maintain the code.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the data corruption issue on PL2303 devices.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the default value of "ret" in the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function, which can cause a driver to return -EOPNOTSUPP during the commit phase of a STP state.

2. This issue triggers a WARN() from switchdev, indicating a potential problem.

3. The issue was reported by Andrew Lunn and has been acknowledged by him.

4. The patch is signed-off by Vivien Didelot and Andrew Lunn.

5. The changes in the patch modify the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function by introducing additional variables and modifying the logic for handling SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE.

6. The patch checks if switchdev_trans_ph_prepare is true, and if so, it sets ret to 0 if the driver supports port_stp_update, or -EOPNOTSUPP otherwise. Otherwise, it calls ds->drv->port_stp_update to update the STP state.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can cause a WARN() and potentially impact the functionality of the system. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on fixing the critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW accessing the freed buffers and potentially causing a host crash. The patch addresses this by deregistering the MR in the firmware (FW) before freeing the fast_reg_page_list.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential crash issue, it can be categorized as fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with list traversal in the powerpc/eeh subsystem. The patch replaces the use of `list_for_each_entry()` with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe traversal of the EEH devices list. 

This change is aimed at preventing potential issues that may arise when iterating over the list while devices are being removed from their parent PE. By using `list_for_each_entry_safe()`, the patch ensures that the iteration remains valid even if devices are removed during the traversal.

Considering the nature of the patch and the potential impact on system stability, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or system instability, which aligns with the criteria for accepting patches in -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the missing XCOPY I/O operation sense_buffer. The patch adds the required sense_buffer to handle CHECK_CONDITION exceptions within the locally generated XCOPY I/O path.

The patch also updates target_xcopy_read_source() and target_xcopy_setup_pt_cmd() to pass the sense_buffer into transport_init_se_cmd() to correctly set up se_cmd->sense_buffer.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug and introduces necessary changes to handle exceptions and correctly set up the sense_buffer, it seems to meet the criteria for a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes corruption on the display and reference counting issues due to fences for pinned objects not being restored upon resume.

2. The bug was introduced in commit 312817a39f17dbb4de000165b5b724e3728cd91c, which is a previous version of the Linux kernel.

3. The bug was reported by Stéphane Marchesin and confirmed by the patch author, Chris Wilson.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes to restore the fences after resume and GPU resets.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and other relevant individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved.

6. The patch modifies multiple files related to the i915 driver, indicating that it addresses the issue at the appropriate level.

Based on these factors, it can be concluded that this patch fixes a real and critical bug and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the pch_uart driver that can lead to a memory access violation. The patch ensures that the DMA channel is allocated when necessary, preventing the issue from occurring.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes a call to `plane->destroy` from the `omap_crtc_destroy` function in `omap_crtc.c`. The patch states that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework, so the explicit call to `plane->destroy` is no longer needed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and it only removes a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a comment explaining the scenario where an RPC client's dentries may not be held by anyone except the notification callback after the MOUNT event.
2. The patch sets the per-net PipeFS superblock before sending the MOUNT notification for the RPC client.
3. If the MOUNT notification fails, the patch jumps to the "err_depopulate" label, which calls the RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification and performs cleanup.
4. Finally, the patch sets "sn->pipefs_sb" to NULL before returning an error or 0.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific scenario related to RPC client dentries and the per-net PipeFS superblock. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to retrieving touch_max in the wacom_retrieve_report_data function in wacom_sys.c.

2. The issue is that rep_data is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch changes the argument passed to wacom_get_report() from "&rep_data" to "rep_data".

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause incorrect behavior or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where Rx data sometimes drops in non-DMA transfer mode due to the read complete condition not being true.

2. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch modify the pch_spi_handler_sub function in the spi-topcliff-pch.c file.

3. Patch Analysis:
   a. The patch adds a condition to check if the transfer complete interrupt has occurred.
   b. If the condition is true, it checks if the tx_index is equal to bpw_len and if the rx_index is equal to tx_index.
   c. If the condition is true, it disables interrupts, sets the transfer_complete and transfer_active flags, and wakes up the wait queue.
   d. If the condition is false, it logs an error message.

4. Impact Analysis:
   a. The patch addresses a specific issue related to Rx data drops in non-DMA transfer mode.
   b. It ensures that the transfer is completed before setting the transfer_complete flag and waking up the wait queue.
   c. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior significantly.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning reported by Linus Torvalds, indicating a potential undefined behavior in the code.
2. The warning is caused by a loop that iterates from 0 to 3, but the array `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` only has two members. This results in overwriting the last two iterations.
3. Although the bug seems benign in practice, as the overwritten values are not used, it is still a valid issue that needs fixing.
4. Linus Torvalds has pulled the patch and mentioned that it doesn't seem to affect the build or functionality, but requests for it to be fixed.
5. The proposed fix changes the size of the array `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct approach.

Considering the above points, the patch addresses a real issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/i915/gen9: Add WaFbcTurnOffFbcWatermark." According to the bspec (presumably the Intel Graphics Programmer's Reference Manual), this patch prevents screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch adds a new workaround to the gen9_init_clock_gating function in the intel_pm.c file. It writes a value to the DISP_ARB_CTL register to turn off the FBC watermark for the skl, bxt, and kbl platforms.

3. References:
   The patch references HSD#2135555, HSD#2137270, and BSID#562. These references likely provide additional information about the issues being addressed.

4. Cc and Signed-off-by:
   The patch includes Cc (Carbon Copy) recipients and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to screen corruption when using FBC. Since screen corruption can be considered a critical bug, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to fix a build error caused by the use of ACCESS_ONCE() in certain files when CONFIG_KASAN is enabled with gcc-5. The error is related to the frame size being larger than 1024 bytes, which can lead to a kernel stack overflow.

The patch suggests removing the use of ACCESS_ONCE() and directly accessing the register address using base + reg. The author has verified that the object code generated by gcc-5.3.1 is better without ACCESS_ONCE() and that the object code generated by gcc-7.0.0 is already good either way.

Considering that the issue is specific to certain builds with gcc-5 and CONFIG_KASAN, and that the patch has been tested and verified to improve the object code, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Although it may not be urgent for inclusion in the upcoming 4.11 release, it is suggested to backport it to older kernels.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up. The patch includes a call to `mtk_stop()` to properly stop and free DMA resources and restore the state changed by `mtk_open()` during module removal.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. It replaces the use of `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `truncate_pagecache()` in the `ext4_collapse_range()` function in `fs/ext4/extents.c`. The patch aims to truncate the page cache from the specified offset to the end of the file and remove private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to truncating the page cache and ensures the removal of private COWed pages, it can be considered a non-trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The driver is calling s3c_hsotg_phy_disable three times instead of once when it is removed. This can lead to a decrease in the phy reference counter below zero and subsequent module insertions fail.

2. The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from both s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions. The s3c_hsotg_udc_stop function is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which in turn calls s3c_hsotg_pullup, which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Therefore, there is no need to disable the phy again in s3c_hsotg_remove.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by them.

4. The patch includes the appropriate Cc and Signed-off-by tags.

5. The patch is targeted for the stable branch (Cc: stable), indicating that it is intended to fix a bug in a stable release.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM, allowing the HCR to be changed on a per-vCPU basis. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freezing groups with stopped tasks in the cgroup freezer subsystem. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it in the original locations where freezing is checked.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix. This indicates that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, as it ensures that groups with stopped tasks can be properly frozen.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The patch addresses a bug that causes a splat (kernel warning) during the netns destroy path. This bug is triggered when using xt_hashlimit with both IPv4 and IPv6 together.

2. The bug has a critical impact: The bug causes a splat, indicating a potential issue that can lead to system instability or crashes.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not include spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It focuses on fixing the bug itself.

4. The patch improves code correctness: The patch ensures that the net/ip6t_hashlimit entries are properly removed in the hashlimit_proc_net_exit() function, addressing the lack of removal for IPv6 entries.

5. The patch is signed-off by recognized contributors: The patch is signed-off by Sergey Popovich and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and improve the stability of the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the i2c-sun6i-p2wi driver related to the use of snprintf. The patch replaces the snprintf call with strlcpy to avoid potential issues with formatting characters in the pdev name.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential issue with formatting characters.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue with the DMA debug API not handling multiple mappings of the same buffer correctly. This bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It describes how the debug_dma_mapping_error function was not setting the map_err_type correctly when multiple mappings existed. The patch resolves this by updating the search algorithm to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address.

3. The patch also mentions a secondary side effect, where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type. However, this behavior is considered preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs and acknowledgments from relevant individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug in the DMA debug API and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c file. The patch corrects the pointer passed to the free_irq() function, ensuring that the same pointer passed to request_irq() is used. This is important because free_irq() expects the same pointer to properly free the IRQ.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue related to freeing an IRQ.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "hwmon: (f75375s) Fix bit shifting in f75375_write16". This suggests that it aims to fix a specific issue related to bit shifting in the f75375_write16 function in the hwmon subsystem.

2. The patch description explains that the issue lies in the incorrect direction of the bit shift. Instead of shifting the value to the left, it should be shifted to the right in order to extract the high byte of the 16-bit word.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the author and the maintainer, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the line in question is modified from `(value << 8)` to `(value >> 8)`. This change correctly shifts the value to the right by 8 bits.

Based on this analysis, I would conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a specific bug related to bit shifting in the f75375_write16 function, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an incorrect use of BUG_ON in the iscsit_process_nop_out() function. The patch replaces the BUG_ON with a REJECT + PROTOCOL_ERROR response when encountering a specific condition.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the incorrect use of BUG_ON can lead to a potential issue when a flood of zeros in the data stream reaches the block for a NOP-OUT without a valid iscsi_cmd pointer.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the bug can potentially lead to a protocol error and disrupt the expected behavior of the system.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch addresses a specific bug and does not include any trivial changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a protocol error.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the incorrect alteration of the "kptr_restrict" variable instead of the "dmesg_restrict" variable. The patch also adds a CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to both variables, as they are both sensitive.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real issue that could potentially lead to a security vulnerability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to remote attribute invalidation in the XFS file system. The patch addresses a calculation issue in the xfs_attr3_leaf_inactive() function, ensuring that the length of the attribute is calculated correctly.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria for inclusion. The patch does fix a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting a calculation error.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the assignment of `ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi` in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. The bug is reported to trigger a `BUG_ON` assertion failure in the `ioapic_service` function.

The patch modifies the assignment of `ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi` by checking the return value of `kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic` and setting it to 0 if the return value is less than 0. This change ensures that `ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi` is not left with an invalid value.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it does not seem to be a critical issue causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the fix does not involve any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it could be considered for inclusion in future non-stable releases or distributions if deemed necessary.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch modifies the code in the "exynos_mcpm_init" function in the "mcpm-exynos.c" file. It changes the way the secondary CPUs are brought up on Exynos MCPM systems.

The patch explains that the firmware on Exynos MCPM systems is hardcoded to jump to an address in SRAM when secondary CPUs come up. The firmware expects the kernel to fill in certain slots with addresses that it uses to jump back to the kernel's entry point for secondary CPUs. However, the patch suggests not relying on the code provided by the bootloader and instead using the kernel's own code to jump to the kernel.

The reason for this change is that older bootloaders, like the one shipped on the Samsung Chromebook 2, might have put slightly different code into the SRAM location. By using the kernel's own code, potential problems caused by different bootloader code can be avoided.

The patch includes the necessary code changes to redirect the firmware's jump to the kernel's entry point. It also mentions that after implementing suspend/resume for systems using exynos-mcpm, the fixed code needs to be reinstalled.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue caused by different bootloader code and improves the reliability of bringing up secondary CPUs on Exynos MCPM systems.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new functions `task_ppid_nr_ns()` and `task_ppid_nr()` to abstract the lookup of the PPID (real_parent's pid_t) of a process, including rcu locking, in the arbitrary and init_pid_ns. These functions provide an alternative to `sys_getppid()`, which is relative to the child process' pid namespace.

The patch also includes a new function `pid_alive()` to check if a process is alive based on its task structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces new functions for abstracting the lookup of the PPID and checking if a process is alive.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the transmission handling in the dw_mmc driver. The issue is described as a sequence break and lock-up that occurs when the IDMAC interrupt sets EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE regardless of DTO rising.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: Yes, the patch addresses a sequence break and lock-up issue, which can be considered a critical bug.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: Yes, the bug causes a lock-up, which can be classified as a "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a lock-up, and it does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK):

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to the ARM architecture and the BPF_ALU | BPF_DIV | BPF_K instruction.
2. The issue is described as a potential register overlap problem when loading the dividend and divisor registers.
3. The patch addresses the issue by loading the dividend register (rn) into ARM_R1 before loading the divisor register (rm) into ARM_R0.
4. The patch includes comments explaining the rationale behind the changes.
5. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Mircea Gherzan.
6. The patch is signed-off by Nicolas Schichan and David S. Miller.
7. The patch includes a Fixes tag referencing the commit that introduced the issue.
8. The patch is also marked for stable release (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to register overlap in the ARM architecture. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes the sane_reclaim() helper function in the vmscan.c file.
2. The helper function is modified to return false for memcg reclaim if the legacy hierarchy is used.
3. This change is necessary because the legacy hierarchy lacks a dirty throttling mechanism.
4. The patch fixes an accidental breakage caused by commit 33398cf2f360c ("memcg: export struct mem_cgroup").
5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to the memcg reclaim process in the Linux kernel. It addresses a regression caused by a previous commit and ensures that the sane_reclaim() helper function behaves correctly when the legacy hierarchy is used.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there was a recent change that was intended to fix an off-by-one error in the OOB-port completion handler for the digi_acceleport USB serial driver. However, this change introduced a new off-by-one error instead. This error could lead to modem-status changes going unnoticed, effectively breaking TIOCMGET.

The patch fixes the loop-condition underflow by adjusting the loop termination condition in the digi_read_oob_callback() function. The original condition was "i < urb->actual_length - 4", but it was changed to "i < urb->actual_length - 3". This change correctly accounts for the size of the buffer and prevents the off-by-one error.

Considering the nature of the bug and its impact on functionality, it can be classified as a real and critical bug that affects the stability and functionality of the USB serial driver. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to ensure that the issue is resolved for users.

Additionally, the patch includes proper attribution to the person who reported the issue and the commit that introduced the bug. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors of the patch.

In conclusion, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to the Acer C720 and C720P Chromebooks. It introduces a quirk to ignore the backlight presence check during backlight setup, which allows for proper control of the backlight on these devices.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it appears to be a specific workaround for a non-critical issue related to the backlight on the mentioned Chromebooks.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a typo in the documentation and removes two bits from the DMA channel status register when reading it.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK):

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to requests that completed while IO was frozen in the DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) driver.

2. It ensures that the connection_lost_while_pending event is applied to requests on the barrier_acked_requests list, which was previously not done.

3. The patch also includes a fix for completing local-only READs correctly when the resend event is triggered.

4. The patch is signed-off by the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to request completion and event handling in the DRBD driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an alignment issue for ARM64 architecture in the v4l2-compat-ioctl32.c file.

2. The alignment/padding rules on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures differ. This patch ensures that compatible ioctls on ARM64 kernels work correctly without breaking AMD64.

3. The patch changes the type of the "id" field in the struct v4l2_standard32 from an array of __u32 to compat_u64 to ensure proper alignment.

4. The patch also removes the "__attribute__ ((packed))" attribute from the struct v4l2_input32, which indicates that the struct should be packed tightly without any padding. This change aligns the struct according to the architecture's alignment rules.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses an alignment issue specific to ARM64 architecture and ensures compatibility without breaking AMD64. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix related to alignment and padding.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not meet the requirements for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the flush_tlb_range() function. The patch adds the necessary locking mechanism to ensure that the ->page_table_lock is held when the ->mmap_sem is not held. This is important because some page table flushing instances explicitly work with page tables.

The patch also mentions that almost all other callers of flush_tlb_range() are already fine and either hold exclusive ->mmap_sem or mm->page_table_lock. The patch only affects a specific caller that is the sole exception.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug related to locking and ensures proper synchronization, it seems to fix a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses the issue of tcp_v4_clear_md5_list() assuming that multiple tcp md5sig peers only hold one reference to md5sig_pool, but tcp_v4_md5_do_add() increases the use count of md5sig_pool for each peer.

2. The patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count for the first tcp md5sig peer.

3. The patch also adds a similar modification to tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count for the first tcp md5sig peer.

4. The patch includes changes to properly handle the allocation and deallocation of md5sig_pool and keys arrays.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to the handling of md5sig_pool references in TCP. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the logic of tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to correctly handle the use count of md5sig_pool. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The current implementation uses a static variable `hidg_desc` to store the report descriptor, which can be overwritten if multiple instances of the `hid` function are used. This can lead to incorrect behavior.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: If the `hidg_desc` variable is overwritten, the report descriptor sent to the host in the `hidg_setup()` function may be incorrect, leading to data corruption.

3. The patch fixes the bug by creating a copy of the `hidg_desc` variable in the `hidg_setup()` function. This copy is then used to send the correct report descriptor to the host.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It addresses a real issue and does not include any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation has a small window where the network device can be made visible, but the necessary resources, such as clock and MDIO bus, have not been set up yet. This can lead to errors and failures during device initialization.

2. The error message indicates that the CSR clock cannot be obtained, and there is no reset control found. These issues can cause the network device to fail to attach to the PHY, resulting in a non-functional network interface.

3. The patch fixes the issue by ensuring that register_netdev() is the last operation performed. This guarantees that the clock and MDIO bus are available before the network device is registered.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the bug.

5. The patch has been reported by a user and signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "dm thin: fix missing pool reference count decrement in pool_ctr error path." This suggests that it fixes a bug related to reference count decrement in the error path of the pool_ctr function in the dm thin driver.

2. The "Fixes" tag indicates that this patch addresses a specific commit (ac8c3f3df) that introduced the bug.

3. The patch is signed-off by Mike Snitzer, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The "Cc" tag includes the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that this patch is being considered for inclusion in the stable kernel releases.

5. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the pool_ctr function. It replaces a "goto out_free_pt" statement with a "goto out_flags_changed" statement.

6. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this change. However, based on the code changes alone, it appears to fix a potential issue related to reference count decrement in the error path.

7. The patch does not seem to address any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not appear to fix any "oh, that's not good" issues.

8. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical bug fix that does not address any severe issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for setting the default hoplimit to zero in IPv6. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The commit message explains that the patch modifies the hoplimit checking condition and default value in `ip6_dst_hoplimit`, but it does not zero all hoplimit default values.

2. The patch sets `ip6_template_metrics[RTAX_HOPLIMIT - 1]` to zero, which forces it as a constant value. This change is necessary due to a previous commit that forces `dst_default_metrics` to the const section.

3. The patch modifies the `dst_metric_set` function call in `icmp6_dst_alloc` to set the hoplimit to zero instead of 255.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real issue by correctly setting the default hoplimit to zero in IPv6. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential problem that could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch aims to limit the number of loops for reading a split 64-bit register in the i915 driver. This indicates that there is a bug related to reading these registers accurately.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: The patch mentions that due to the nature of the registers being read, they may increment between the two instructions, potentially leading to inaccurate results. This can result in data corruption.

3. The patch provides a solution: The patch introduces a loop that repeats the read if an overflow is detected, ensuring accurate results. However, it also includes a mechanism to give up after a couple of tries if the upper 32 bits of the register are not stable.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to HDMI jack detection and ELD information update. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch aims to delay the HDMI jack detect notification until ELD information is fully updated. This is done to avoid potential failures when user-space queries the HDMI ELD immediately after receiving the notification.

2. The patch modifies the function `hdmi_present_sense` to return a boolean value instead of being void. This change allows the caller to determine whether the ELD information is fully updated or not.

3. In the `hdmi_intrinsic_event` function, the `hdmi_present_sense` function is called with the `repoll` parameter set to 1. If `hdmi_present_sense` returns true, indicating that the ELD information is fully updated, `snd_hda_jack_report_sync` is called to report the jack status.

4. The `hdmi_repoll_eld` function is modified to call `hdmi_present_sense` with the `repoll` parameter and, if it returns true, `snd_hda_jack_report_sync` is called.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to HDMI jack detection and ELD information update. It introduces a workaround to delay the jack detect notification until the ELD information is fully updated. While the patch is described as "imperfect," it is considered a good starting point.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue related to HDMI jack detection and ELD information update.

3. The patch replaces btrfs_attach_transaction with btrfs_join_transaction and checks for a blocked commit.
4. It also adds a check to skip waiting if the commit is already started.
5. The patch sets the transaction's sync flag to true and runs the delayed refs.
6. It checks if the transaction's transid is greater than the async transid and skips flushing if it is.
7. Finally, it ends the transaction and updates the error status if necessary.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue (deadlock) and improves the safety and efficiency of the code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the ARCNET driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description explains that the minimum ARCNET header only contains 4 bytes for source, destination, and offset. It mentions that the struct `arc_hardware` represents this bare minimum header.

2. The `archdr` struct contains a union of possible soft headers, which may be short or even absent in some cases.

3. The patch suggests using `arc_hardware` instead of `archdr` to determine the `hard_header_len` for an ARCNET device.

4. The `dev->hard_header_len` field is updated to use `sizeof(struct arc_hardware)` instead of `sizeof(struct archdr)`.

5. The rest of the code in the patch seems unrelated to the issue being fixed.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the determination of `hard_header_len` for ARCNET devices. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves correctly setting the header length based on the specific ARCNET header structure.

2. The patch removes the code that requests and releases the port reservation for the VMMOUSE driver. Since the port is designed to be shared among multiple VMWare services, including VMMOUSE, it should not try to reserve the port on its own.

3. The removal of the request_region() and release_region() calls ensures that the port is not reserved by the VMMOUSE driver, allowing other drivers to use it if needed.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals from VMWare, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical issue related to port reservation conflicts in the VMMOUSE driver. It does not introduce any trivial changes and has been reviewed by relevant parties. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Description of the problem:
   The current implementation of nfs4_handle_exception in nfs4proc.c can cause a hang in a specific test case where a client tries to lock a file after the server returns NFS4ERR_BADSESSION. The open recovery is not scheduled properly, leading to the hang.

2. Proposed solution:
   The patch suggests waiting for session recovery to run before retrying the lock. This will ensure that the session recovery is completed before proceeding with the lock attempt.

3. Analysis:
   The problem described in the patch is a real issue that can cause a hang in certain scenarios. It affects the stability and functionality of the NFS (Network File System) protocol. The proposed solution seems reasonable and addresses the problem by introducing a necessary wait for session recovery.

4. Impact assessment:
   The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes, spelling changes, or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the hang issue caused by the incorrect scheduling of session recovery.

5. Patch review:
   The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Bryan Schumaker and Trond Myklebust, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel. The patch also includes the appropriate Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list for consideration in stable releases.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "mac80211: stop polling in disassociation." It suggests stopping the connection monitor poll during disassociation to clear the polling flags and run any deferred scans.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue where a scan is deferred due to connection monitoring during disassociation. This can cause problems connecting to another access point (AP) as the scan blocks further scan requests until the interface is brought down and up again.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "ieee80211_set_disassoc" and "ieee80211_sta_connection_lost" functions to stop the polling before disassociation.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue that can cause problems with connecting to other APs and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to silent output on VAIO Z with ALC889. The patch adds a fix-up to choose the speaker pin as the primary, ensuring the correct DAC is assigned on this device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes silent output, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check to the __tick_broadcast_oneshot_control() function in the tick-broadcast.c file.
2. The check is for the mode of the tick broadcast device. If the mode is TICKDEV_MODE_PERIODIC, the patch adds additional logic.
3. The additional logic checks if the broadcast device is hrtimer-based by examining the features of the broadcast controller (bc).
4. If the broadcast device is hrtimer-based, the patch sets the return value to -EBUSY and exits the function.
5. If the broadcast device is not hrtimer-based, the function continues with the existing logic.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific scenario where the system is in periodic mode and the broadcast device is hrtimer-based. In this scenario, the patch returns -EBUSY to indicate that there is no proper handling for this case.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific scenario and does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   - This indicates that there is a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or instability.

2. The patch takes the isert_conn pointer from cm_id->qp->qp_context to ensure that the cm_id context is always the network portal.
   - This change improves the reliability of the cm_id event check.

3. The patch avoids a NULL dereference in cma_id->qp->qp_context by destroying the qp after destroying the cm_id.
   - This ensures that the dereference is safe and prevents potential crashes.

4. The patch protects the isert_conn->conn_device->active_qps decrement within the error patch during QP creation failure and the normal teardown path in isert_connect_release().
   - This change ensures that the decrement operation is properly synchronized and avoids potential race conditions.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to a race condition and improves the reliability of the cm_id event check.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an optimization or performance improvement rather than a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to EAPD GPIO control for Sigmatel codecs. The bug caused a loss of speaker outputs per HP plugging or power-saving. The patch includes spec->eapd_mask into spec->gpio_mask and spec->gpio_data bits to fix the issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause a loss of functionality. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the channels in the channel spec as unsigned rather than signed. This change is necessary to correctly interpret the values reported by the AD7780 device.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a minor adjustment to the code logic.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning generated by GCC 7. The warning is related to the use of `memset` with a length equal to the number of elements without multiplication by element size.

The patch correctly fixes this warning by passing the correct size to `memset`. It changes the line `memset(chan->curve_data, 0, sizeof(*chan->curve_data));` to `memset(chan->curve_data, 0, sizeof(chan->curve_data));`.

Since this patch is a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

The code changes are not trivial and involve proper locking to prevent data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data sign in the iio: st_pressure driver. The patch changes the sign of the pressure and temperature data from unsigned ('u') to signed ('s') in multiple channel specifications.

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect data interpretation, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch also includes appropriate Fixes tags, indicating that it addresses specific commits where the bug was introduced.

However, it is important to note that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which aligns with the requirement for patches accepted in -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch forces the function `kernel_init_freeable()` to be marked as `noinline`, reducing code bloat. While this may improve performance, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch description states that it fixes an incorrect condition in determining the last logical address (last_la) used for claiming a logical address in the CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) subsystem.

2. The patch modifies the code in the cec_config_thread_func() function in the cec-adap.c file.

3. In the original code, the condition !(last_la & type2mask[type]) is used to check if the last_la is not set for the given type. However, this condition is incorrect because it does not convert last_la to a mask before performing the AND operation with type2mask[type].

4. The patch fixes the condition by adding the conversion of last_la to a mask using the expression (1 << last_la) before performing the AND operation with type2mask[type].

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug in the code that could lead to incorrect logical address determination in the CEC subsystem. The bug does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, but it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. The fix itself is not trivial and addresses the incorrect condition in the code.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question removes a redundant error check on the return code of `copy_to_user` function. The patch is fixing a logical dead code issue detected by CoverityScan and references a previous fix for the misuse of the return value of `copy_to_user`.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to switching credentials and potential information leaks. Here is the analysis of the patch:

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a mutex lock definition for `trace_types_lock` in `trace_events.c`. This lock is used to protect the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list.

2. The patch also adds an external declaration for `trace_types_lock` in `trace.h`.

3. In `subsystem_open()`, the patch adds a mutex lock before accessing the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list and unlocks it afterward.

4. In `trace_add_event_call()`, the patch adds a mutex lock before registering and adding an event to the tracers, and unlocks it afterward.

5. In `__trace_remove_event_call()` and `trace_remove_event_call()`, the patch adds a mutex lock before removing an event call and unlocks it afterward.

6. In `trace_module_notify()`, the patch adds a mutex lock before handling module notifications and unlocks it afterward.

Based on the analysis, this patch adds necessary mutex locks to protect the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list and ensures proper synchronization when accessing it. It addresses a potential concurrency issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a specific error related to the nouveau driver on G5 iMac systems. The error message suggests a failure to create a kernel channel, which could potentially lead to a hang or other issues.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of strncpy to strscpy in the orangefs_inode_getattr function in the orangefs-utils.c file.

2. The patch addresses a potential issue where a rogue client-core could send a symlink target that is not NUL terminated, which could result in corrupt data.

3. The patch replaces strncpy with strscpy, which is a safer alternative. strscpy ensures that the destination buffer is always NUL terminated and returns an error if the source string is too long.

4. The patch also includes error handling code. If strscpy returns -E2BIG (indicating that the source string is too long), the patch sets the return value to -EIO and jumps to the "out" label.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption and provides a safer alternative to strncpy. Additionally, it includes proper error handling to handle cases where the source string is too long.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled for the ext4 file system. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to enable journal checksumming if metadata checksumming is enabled for the file system. This is a logical step to ensure consistency and integrity of the file system.

2. The patch includes the necessary code changes to set the JOURNAL_CHECKSUM option when ext4_has_metadata_csum(sb) returns true. This ensures that the journal will use checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on enabling journal checksumming when necessary.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue by enabling journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled, which helps maintain the integrity of the file system.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a panic due to an inability to handle a paging request. The bug is caused by the driver freeing a Tx frag that was never mapped before. This bug can lead to system instability and data corruption.

The patch modifies the `qlcnic_release_tx_buffers` function in the `qlcnic_init.c` file. It changes the loop condition from `for (j = 0; j < cmd_buf->frag_count; j++)` to `for (j = 1; j < cmd_buf->frag_count; j++)`. This change ensures that the driver does not attempt to free a Tx frag that was never mapped.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug that can lead to system instability and data corruption.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a build error that occurs when using a modular phylib. The error is caused by the undeclared identifier 'ksz9021rn_phy_fixup' in the 'imx6q_sabrelite_init' function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses a build error caused by a missing declaration.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a regression introduced by commit 5ed0bdf21a85d78e04f89f15ccf227562177cbd9. The regression caused a negative timeout to return immediately instead of waiting indefinitely, which is the previously defined behavior.

The patch includes a testcase and references a bugzilla entry, indicating that it addresses a real issue. It also has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.

Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the condition for handling a timeout in the i915_gem_wait_ioctl function. It changes the comparison from `<= 0` to `== 0`, ensuring that a timeout value of 0 is treated as an indefinite wait.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression and addresses a real issue without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The HIH6130/1 sensor requires zero-length data transfers to start a measurement, but some I2C bus drivers do not allow this. The patch proposes a workaround by writing a zero dummy byte, which has been verified to work with the OMAP I2C bus driver on a BeagleBone board.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It introduces a new variable, "write_length," to handle the length of the I2C measurement request.

3. The patch does not introduce any security issues: It is focused on fixing a specific functionality related to the HIH6130/1 sensor and does not involve any security-related changes.

4. The patch does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption: It addresses a limitation in certain I2C bus drivers and provides a workaround to ensure proper functionality of the HIH6130/1 sensor.

Based on these considerations, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value of the probe function from "err" to 0. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple return value modification that does not address any significant problem.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform, which indicates that it addresses a specific hardware compatibility issue.

2. The patch includes changes to the device tree bindings documentation, which ensures that the device node for the davinci_emac interface contains the required properties.

3. The "compatible" property is extended to include the "ti,dm816-emac" value, indicating support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform.

4. The patch adds a new entry to the "davinci_emac_of_match" array, associating the "ti,dm816-emac" compatible string with the "dm816_emac_data" structure.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform. Since it addresses a specific hardware compatibility issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "s390/kdump: Clear subchannel ID to signal non-CCW/SCSI IPL". 

The patch description explains that there are use cases where an intermediate boot kernel uses kexec to boot the final production kernel. In this scenario, the original boot information should be provided to the production kernel. Therefore, clearing the boot information during kexec should not be done.

Looking at the code changes, the lines that clear the subchannel ID and number have been removed. These lines were previously used to signal the new kernel that no CCW or SCSI IPL has been done during kexec and kdump.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is reverting a change that is necessary for specific use cases involving kexec and kdump. Without more context or information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and analysis to understand the implications of reverting this change and whether it is necessary for fixing a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific hardware erratum related to the P2020/P2010 processors. The erratum, known as eTSEC 20, causes excess delays when transmitting large frames with TOE (TCP/IP hardware accelerations) enabled. The patch enables a workaround for this issue.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Real and critical bug: The excess delay issue caused by the eTSEC 20 erratum can be considered a real and critical bug as it affects the transmission of large frames with TOE enabled.

2. Build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue: The patch does not address any of these specific issues. It is focused on fixing the eTSEC 20 erratum.

3. Trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, the patch seems to address a real and critical bug, but it does not fall into the categories of build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a race condition between URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer, potentially leading to an oops in xhci_giveback_urb_in_irq().

The patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue(), handle_stopped_endpoint(), xhci_stop_endpoint_command_watchdog(), finish_td(), and xhci_queue_isoc_tx() functions to remove TDs from the TD lists and canceled TD lists before giving back the URB. This ensures that the URB's priv pointer is freed and set to NULL, preventing oopses caused by accessing killed URBs.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential hang and data corruption issue, which qualifies as a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture in the KVM subsystem. The patch addresses a problem where the advancing of the program counter (PC) when completing an MMIO load is done before re-entering the guest, which can lead to unsafe access to guest code.

The patch introduces a precalculated resume PC, stored in the vcpu->arch.io_pc field, which is restored on MMIO completion. This ensures that the correct PC is used and prevents potential issues with accessing the wrong memory location.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific bug related to the MIPS architecture, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to interrupt timeout handling in the net/mvmdio driver. The patch ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, which guarantees that wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to handling vce pg flags properly in the amdgpu driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch checks if the pg_flags for VCE (Video Codec Engine) support is enabled in the amdgpu device. If it is not enabled, the function returns 0, indicating that the VCE block should not be started or stopped.

2. In the vce_v2_0_set_powergating_state() function, if the requested state is AMD_PG_STATE_GATE (indicating power gating), the function returns 0 without performing any further actions. This suggests that the VCE block does not need to be stopped in this case.

3. Similarly, in the vce_v3_0_set_powergating_state() function, if the requested state is AMD_PG_STATE_GATE, the function returns 0 without performing any further actions.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to handling VCE power gating flags correctly. It ensures that the VCE block is not started or stopped when the pg_flags for VCE support are not enabled. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or instability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to VCE power gating and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch initializes the network_header and transport_header fields in the skb structure created in vnet_rx_one() function.
   - This is necessary for vnet_fullcsum() to compute the checksum for IPv4 packets correctly.

2. The patch checks if the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag is set in the dext->flags field.
   - If the flag is set and the skb protocol is ETH_P_IP, it proceeds to update the IP header checksum by setting it to 0 and calling ip_send_check().

3. The patch also checks if the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag is set in the dext->flags field and if skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE.
   - If both conditions are met, it proceeds to update the transport header and compute the full checksum using vnet_fullcsum().

4. Finally, the patch checks if the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM_OK flag is set in the dext->flags field.
   - If the flag is set, it sets skb->ip_summed to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and skb->csum_level to 0.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to checksum computation for IPv4 packets in the sunvnet driver. It ensures that the necessary headers are properly initialized and checksums are computed correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload). The patch introduces a new function `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` to detect TSO DMA buffers that cross into regions within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of any 4GB boundaries. If the device is of ASIC revision 5762 and the MSS is non-zero, the function checks if the buffer crosses the boundary and triggers the workaround path if necessary.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug that can lead to data corruption, it falls under the category of fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to the `omap_hsmmc_context_save()` function after enabling runtime power management. This change ensures that register access in the context save API happens with the clock enabled.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not address any significant performance improvements or stability enhancements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a double fetch bug in the ioctl function of the cros_ec_dev driver. This bug could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" change between the two copy_from_user() calls.

2. The patch improves security: By verifying that the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" have not changed between the copy_from_user() calls, the patch prevents potential buffer overflows, which could be exploited by attackers.

3. The patch fixes a potential data corruption issue: The patch ensures that the correct value of "s_cmd->insize" is used, even if cros_ec_cmd_xfer() sets it to a lower value. This prevents copying too much data to the user, which could result in data corruption.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: The patch has been reviewed by Kees Cook and tested by Gwendal Grignou, which adds confidence in its correctness and effectiveness.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a real and critical bug and does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an issue with a missing line that initializes a variable. This fix does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to an information leak in AUDIT_GET requests. The patch initializes the "mask" member of the "status_set" structure to zero, which prevents the leakage of 4 bytes of kernel stack.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information leakage. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch simplifies the ioc_release_fn() function in the block/blk-ioc.c file. It replaces the double lock dancing with a trylock on the queue_lock and backs out from the ioc lock on trylock failure. This simplification improves the code readability and reduces the complexity of the function.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue by simplifying the code logic, which can potentially improve the overall stability and performance of the block layer.

Additionally, the patch has been tested and signed-off by Tejun Heo and Jens Axboe, indicating that it has undergone review and testing by experienced developers.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue where event processing for the AP interface is delayed or not processed after a scan completes. This can result in data halt and eventual disconnection on the AP interface. 

The patch requeues work items for all VIF types after the scan completes, ensuring that event processing is not delayed or missed. It removes the specific requeueing of work items for STA, ADHOC, and MESH iftypes and instead requeues work items for all VIF types.

Considering the nature of the issue being fixed and the potential impact on data integrity and connectivity, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The incorrect usage of the int type for page indices can lead to silent trimming of high bits, causing unexpected failures in the final check of the function.

2. The bug can result in incorrect behavior: If the start index is below the boundary and the end index gets trimmed, the function will incorrectly return false, indicating that there are no pages in the range, even if there is at least one.

3. The affected function, btrfs_page_exists_in_range, is used to prevent races in important operations like hole punching and direct locking. Ensuring the correctness of this function is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing stale data reads.

4. Although the bug has specific constraints for practical occurrence (large file size, crossing the 16TiB boundary, matching internal state), it is still a valid issue that can lead to unexpected behavior.

5. The patch includes proper documentation, including the explanation of the bug, its consequences, and the scenarios where it can occur.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and ensure the correct functioning of the btrfs_page_exists_in_range function.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue in the KVM virtual interrupt controller (vgic) for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses a problem where the active state of an interrupt is checked incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior when external inputs need to access the state of a virtual interrupt.

2. Impact:
   The patch addresses a bug that can cause incorrect behavior in the handling of virtual interrupts. While the exact impact is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that the bug can lead to incorrect behavior in the architected timer code and potentially affect other external inputs as well.

3. Reported-by and Acked-by:
   The patch has been reported by Eric Auger and Acked by Marc Zyngier, indicating that the issue has been identified and acknowledged by experts in the field.

4. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the kvm_vgic_map_is_active() function in the vgic.c file. It replaces the existing check for dist_active_irq(vcpu) with a new function vgic_irq_is_active(vcpu, map->virt_irq), which correctly checks if the specific IRQ in question is active on the distributor.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the KVM virtual interrupt controller for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It fixes an issue that can lead to incorrect behavior in handling virtual interrupts, potentially affecting external inputs such as the architected timer code. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The function `mt_free_input_name()` was not being called during `.remove()`, leading to a memory leak. This bug can cause resource exhaustion and potential system instability.

2. The bug fix is critical: The memory leak occurs when special names are allocated during `.probe()`, but not freed during `.remove()`. By restoring the original name before freeing it, the patch prevents accessing already freed pointers.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve fixing a memory leak and ensuring proper memory management.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Benjamin Tissoires and Jiri Kosina, who are recognized developers in the Linux kernel community.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any new issues.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to allocating new chunks in Btrfs when considering missing devices.
2. The issue occurs when allocating new chunks only on writable devices, which can lead to failure when trying to allocate new chunks with a higher RAID level.
3. The patch fixes the issue by ignoring the number of missing devices when allocating new chunks.
4. The patch is signed-off by Miao Xie <miaox@cn.fujitsu.com> and Chris Mason <clm@fb.com>.
5. The changes in the patch modify the `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` and `update_block_group_flags` functions in the `fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c` file.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to allocating new chunks in Btrfs and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address two issues:

1. Allow the media manager to be initialized without a storage backend for device drivers like null_blk.
2. Fix incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, specifically the get/set bad block interface.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze each change:

1. The first change modifies the null_lnvm_id function in drivers/block/null_blk.c. It updates the id->cap value from 0x3 to 0x2. This change does not fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues. It seems to be a trivial fix, possibly a configuration adjustment. Therefore, this change does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

2. The second change modifies the nvm_register function in drivers/lightnvm/core.c. It adds a conditional check to ensure that the device supports the get/set bad block interface before attempting to initialize the media manager. This change prevents unnecessary initialization attempts for devices that do not support this interface. It addresses a potential issue and improves the code's behavior. Therefore, this change meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting the second change and rejecting the first change.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing iounmap in the probe error path of the rtc-at91rm9200 driver. This fix is necessary to prevent resource leaks and potential issues with the Real Time Clock (RTC) driver on the AT91RM9200 platform.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that addresses a resource leak.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a use-after-free bug in the __put_anon_vma function in the mm/rmap.c file. The bug occurs when referencing the already freed anon_vma->root to check rwsem.

Considering that this bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other critical issues, it falls under the category of a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses the issue of SCSI devices being created at the OS level for non-existing virtual drives (VD) in the megaraid_sas driver. It fixes the problem of accessing indices beyond the array size, which can result in valid LD values being returned and SCSI commands succeeding for non-existing targets.

The patch invalidates LD values in the LdTgtIdtoLd[] array for device indices beyond the supported range. For legacy firmware (64 VD firmware), it sets the LD value to 0xff for device indices beyond 127. This ensures that an invalid LD value (0xff) is returned for device indices beyond the supported range.

In the megaraid_sas_fusion.c file, the patch adds additional checks to prevent accessing ldTgtIdToLd beyond the supported range for older firmware and extended VD firmware.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to SCSI device creation for non-existing VDs and prevents accessing indices beyond the supported range. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a debug message from the critical section of the code. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch ensures that the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set earlier, which prevents a potential issue where the search for an existing inode in the hash table might fail due to the race with the inode initialization code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue in the mtk_tx_map() function in the mediatek Ethernet driver. The patch corrects a copy & paste error by using the correct descriptor pointer when looking up the tx_buffer in the error path.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue in the code that could lead to incorrect buffer lookup in the error path. While the severity of the bug is not explicitly mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that it could cause data corruption or other issues.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the bug could potentially cause data corruption or other issues, which falls under the "oh, that's not good" category.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to incorrect buffer lookup.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to optimize the irq restore process in the s390 architecture.
2. It replaces the use of the ssm instruction with the stosm instruction, which is faster.
3. The comment in the patch clarifies that irqsave/irqrestore only deals with external and I/O interrupts.
4. The arch_local_irq_restore function is modified to check if the flags indicate a transition from disabled to disabled or disabled to enabled. If so, it calls arch_local_irq_enable, which uses the faster stosm instruction.
5. The arch_irqs_disabled_flags function is modified to use the newly defined ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED macro for clarity.
6. The patch also includes a change in arch/s390/mm/init.c, where the arch_local_irq_restore call is replaced with __arch_local_irq_stosm(0x04).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a performance optimization in the s390 architecture without introducing any trivial changes. It does not fix a critical bug or security issue, but it does improve the efficiency of the irq restore process. Therefore, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to interrupt flags on Rx LL2 in the qed driver.
2. The problem is described clearly, stating that the final spin_lock_irqrestore() uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.
3. The patch fixes the issue by passing the pointer to the lock_flags variable to qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() and using it to unlock and re-lock the spinlock.
4. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear reference to the original problem.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers, indicating that it has undergone proper review and testing.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect interrupt status. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit b0d0d915, which removed the BKL (Big Kernel Lock) in the ipx module.
2. The regression causes a deadlock scenario in the mars-nwe (NetWare emulator) where the ncpserv process reads a request using recvmsg, forks and spawns nwconn, and then calls a blocking recvmsg while waiting for new requests. Meanwhile, nwconn deadlocks in sendmsg on the same socket.
3. The commit b0d0d915 replaced the BKL locking with lock_sock/release_sock, but it did not handle the scenario where a blocking recvmsg would block a concurrent sendmsg.
4. The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while actually working with the socket data and releases it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram().
5. The patch includes proper locking and unlocking of the socket, ensuring that a blocking recvmsg does not block a concurrent sendmsg.
6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Jiri Bohac and Arnd Bergmann.

Based on the above analysis, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock scenario, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to task migration and swap selection in the NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) scheduler. The patch aims to avoid selecting oneself as a swap target, which can lead to problems when trying to acquire the same lock twice for swap migration.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a significant problem.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a bug related to the contamination of the percpu pointer with the DEAD flag. The bug can occur when __ref_is_percpu() races with percpu_ref_kill() and sees the DEAD flag without the ATOMIC flag. The proposed fix updates __ref_is_percpu() to test both the ATOMIC and DEAD flags before returning the percpu pointer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch removes a check that restricts the minimum length of GETLAYOUT requests in the nfsd/blocklayout module. This restriction is not allowed according to RFC 5661 section 18.43.3, and it has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some clients. Therefore, this bug can lead to hangs, which qualifies it as a critical issue.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The patch removes the check for minimum length, which is a non-trivial change and not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The patch only removes the check for minimum length, which is necessary to comply with the RFC and prevent hangs. It does not introduce any new code or changes that could potentially cause build errors, oops, data corruption, or security issues.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by trusted developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Christoph Hellwig and J. Bruce Fields, indicating that it has undergone a review process and has been deemed suitable for inclusion in the stable release.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to loop devices and partitions. It states that when detaching a loop device, any partitions added by user space were being left in place.
   - This indicates a potential data corruption issue, as the partitions should be cleaned up when detaching the loop device.

2. The patch replaces the use of BLKRRPART with code that unconditionally cleans up partitions on detach.
   - This change ensures that partitions are always cleaned up, regardless of the LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN flag.

3. The patch also exports the delete_partition() function, which was modified by Jens Axboe.
   - Exporting this function allows other parts of the kernel to use it.

4. In the loop_clr_fd() function, the patch removes the BLKRRPART call and adds code to remove all partitions manually.
   - This change ensures that user-added partitions are properly removed when max_part=0.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to data corruption and provides a proper fix by unconditionally cleaning up partitions on detach. Additionally, the modification by Jens Axboe to export the delete_partition() function seems reasonable and can benefit other parts of the kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to reading remote attributes in the XFS filesystem. The bug causes a verification error when CRCs are enabled, resulting in a failure to read maximally sized remote attributes. The patch addresses two issues: incorrect calculation of the mapped length and incorrect calculation of the byte count of valid data within a buffer.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems like a valid candidate for inclusion in a stable release. It addresses a real issue that can lead to data corruption and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the thermal protection requirements for certain GPU models in the Radeon driver. The patch removes the check for "gfx_clock_gating" and only checks if the "int_thermal_type" is not equal to "THERMAL_TYPE_NONE" to enable thermal protection.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error in the x509_cert_parse() function in the crypto/asymmetric_keys/x509_cert_parser.c file. The patch sets the error code on a specific path that was previously missed, preventing a potential NULL dereference.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could lead to a NULL dereference. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a build error caused by misleading indentation in the mlx4/resource_tracker.c file. The error is triggered by a missing pair of braces in the if statement. The patch adds the missing braces to ensure the correct behavior of the code.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that addresses a warning generated by a newer version of GCC.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a critical bug that causes a crash on resume on the BeagleBoard-X15 platform. This crash is caused by a stray flag in the IRQ configuration.
2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the issue and how it is fixed.
3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Grygorii Strashko and signed-off by Nishanth Menon and Roger Quadros, indicating that it has undergone peer review and testing.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be included.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the handling of snap_context in the rbd_queue_workfn() function in the rbd.c file. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The commit message explains that commit 4e752f0ab0e8 moved ceph_get_snap_context() out of rbd_img_request_create() and into rbd_queue_workfn(). This change added a ceph_put_snap_context() to the error path in rbd_queue_workfn().

2. The issue with the patch is that rbd_img_request_create() consumes a reference on snapc, so calling ceph_put_snap_context() after a successful rbd_img_request_create() leads to an extra put.

3. The patch fixes this issue by setting snapc to NULL after assigning it to img_request->rq. This ensures that the extra put is not performed.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to reference counting in the rbd_queue_workfn() function. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it resolves a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the ehci-hcd driver related to isochronous data handling. The bug can lead to memory leaks and failures to complete isochronous URBs. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and failures. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch disables the forced PORTS_IMPL for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3.
2. It explains that some early controllers incorrectly reported zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register, and the ahci driver fabricated PORTS_IMPL based on the number of ports in those cases.
3. With the new nvme controllers, there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should be honored.
4. The patch disables the workaround for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to incorrect reporting of zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register. It is not a trivial fix, as it involves disabling a workaround for certain AHCI versions. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

2. The patch references a bug report in the Linux kernel bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75401). This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific bug.

3. The patch is signed-off by Alex Deucher and Christian König, who are both recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

4. The patch modifies the radeon_atrm_get_bios() function in the radeon_bios.c file.

5. The added code block checks for non-VGA class pci devices by iterating through the devices with the PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_OTHER class. It retrieves the ACPI handle for each device and checks if the "ATRM" handle exists. If found, the patch sets the "found" flag to true.

6. If no VGA class pci devices are found, the patch falls back to checking for non-VGA class pci devices using the PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_OTHER class. This ensures compatibility with newer PX systems.

7. If no suitable device is found, the function returns false.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific bug and introduces a necessary update to handle non-VGA class pci devices with ATRM. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
