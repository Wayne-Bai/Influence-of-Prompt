2. The first WARN_ON statement checks if the current device is not a Haswell CPU. If this condition is true, it means that the LynxPoint PCH (Platform Controller Hub) is not paired with a Haswell CPU, which is an unexpected configuration. Emitting a warning in this case helps to identify potential hardware compatibility issues.

3. The second WARN_ON statement checks if the current device is not an Ultrabook Low Power (ULT) CPU. If this condition is true, it means that the LynxPoint LP PCH is not paired with an ULT CPU, which is again an unexpected configuration. Emitting a warning in this case helps to identify potential hardware compatibility issues.

4. The patch also updates the dev_priv structure to set the pch_type and num_pch_pll fields accordingly based on the detected PCH type.

5. Finally, the patch includes a BUG_ON statement to check if the number of PCH PLLs exceeds the maximum allowed value.

false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a straightforward code cleanup. The patch removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma" in the "vb2_vmalloc_put_userptr" function.

Since the "vb2_put_vma" function already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant and can be safely removed. This change improves code readability and reduces unnecessary code complexity.

Considering that the patch is a simple cleanup and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered a low-risk change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality from the code. The comment in the patch explains that the SYSRESET bits in the HDMI PLL do not actually reset the PLL itself but only affect the power used for the PLL. Since there is no reason to use the SYSRESET bits and they are not used in other PLLs, removing the HDMI PLL reset simplifies the code and makes it similar to other PLLs.

2. The hdmi_pll_reset() function, which performs the HDMI PLL reset, is removed from the code.

3. The hdmi_pll_enable() function no longer calls hdmi_pll_reset().

Based on the information provided, it seems that the HDMI PLL reset functionality is unnecessary and removing it simplifies the code. As long as the patch has been tested and does not introduce any regressions or issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a filesystem operation.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. The `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function is a variant of `lookup_one_len()` that performs the lookup without acquiring the parent directory's inode lock. This change is made to improve performance and reduce lock contention.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp`) than the original dentry (`dentry`). In this case, the patch checks if the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. If it has been renamed, the patch assumes that the dentry has been looked up and connected, and therefore, it is considered already reconnected. The patch then proceeds to clean up the temporary dentry (`tmp`) and jumps to the `out_reconnected` label.

This logic makes sense because if the dentry has been renamed, it implies that it has been looked up and connected, and there is no need to perform any further reconnection steps. The patch handles this scenario efficiently by avoiding unnecessary operations.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement to the `reconnect_one()` function, providing better performance and handling the case of renamed dentries correctly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "ARM: ensure vm_struct has its phys_addr member filled in." This suggests that the patch aims to ensure that the phys_addr member of the vm_struct structure is properly populated.

3. The patch has been Acked-by Nicolas Pitre, indicating that another expert in the field has reviewed and approved the change.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Russell King, who is a recognized contributor to the ARM Linux kernel.

5. The code change itself adds a single line that assigns the physical address of the given pfn to the phys_addr member of the vm_struct structure.

6. The added line does not introduce any new dependencies or potential issues.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a straightforward and beneficial change that improves the functionality of /proc/vmallocinfo for ARM systems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

   - The patch adds a new field, `lru_slot`, of type `atomic_t`, to the `struct kvm_memslots` data structure.
   - The `search_memslots` function is modified to utilize the LRU cache.
   - The LRU cache is implemented by storing the index of the most recently used memslot in the `lru_slot` field.
   - When searching for a memslot, the function first checks if the requested guest frame number (gfn) falls within the range of the memslot stored in the LRU cache. If it does, the function returns the memslot directly.
   - If the gfn does not match the memslot in the LRU cache, the function performs a linear search through all memslots to find the appropriate one. Once found, the index of the memslot is stored in the `lru_slot` field for future use.

3. Benefits of the patch:
   - The patch claims to improve the average lookup time for the given workload from 46 to 28 cycles, which is approximately a 40% improvement.
   - By caching the most recently used memslot, the patch reduces the need for repeated linear searches through all memslots, resulting in faster lookup times.

4. Overall assessment:
   - The patch introduces a simple and efficient LRU caching mechanism for memslot lookup in the KVM subsystem.
   - The claimed performance improvement of approximately 40% for the given workload is significant.
   - The changes made by the patch are localized to the `search_memslots` function and the `struct kvm_memslots`, minimizing the impact on other parts of the codebase.
   - The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by two recognized contributors.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new helper function called `denali_multidev_fixup` to collect multi NAND fixups. This improves code organization and readability.

2. The `denali_multidev_fixup` function performs necessary calculations and adjustments for multi-device support. It updates various parameters related to the MTD (Memory Technology Device) and NAND chip, such as size, erase size, write size, OOB size, chip size, page shift, erase shift, chip shift, page mask, ECC size, ECC bytes, and ECC strength. These adjustments ensure that the core framework correctly handles multi-device configurations.

3. The original code in `denali_init` had scattered multi-device fixups, which made the code harder to understand and maintain. The patch moves these fixups to the new helper function, improving code modularity and maintainability.

4. The patch also removes redundant code from `denali_init` that performed similar fixups, which were already handled by the new helper function.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch improves code organization, enhances multi-device support, and removes redundant code. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the usage of macros `PCI9111_REGISTER_INPUT_SIGNAL_RANGE` and `PCI9111_REGISTER_RANGE_STATUS_READBACK` and replaces them with more descriptive macros `PCI9111_AI_RANGE_REG` and `PCI9111_RANGE_STATUS_REG`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch also removes the `pci9111_ai_range_set()` and `pci9111_ai_range_get()` macros, which were not used anywhere in the code. Removing unused code helps reduce code complexity and potential bugs.

3. The patch modifies the `pci9111_ai_do_cmd()` function to directly write the range value to the `PCI9111_AI_RANGE_REG` register instead of using the `pci9111_ai_range_set()` macro. This change simplifies the code and improves performance.

4. Similarly, the patch modifies the `pci9111_ai_insn_read()` function to directly read the current range value from the `PCI9111_RANGE_STATUS_REG` register instead of using the `pci9111_ai_range_get()` macro. This change simplifies the code and improves performance.

4. The patch has been signed-off by Jouni Malinen and Kalle Valo, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

5. The change is a straightforward removal of the incorrect capability flag and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a known issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a new capability to the microblaze architecture for the system timer.
2. It allows the device tree source (DTS) author to flag a specific timer as the system timer.
3. If the chosen node in the device tree contains a "system-timer=<&foo>" entry, the handle specified in the entry will be used as the system timer.
4. If no such entry exists, the first found timer will be used, which is the current behavior.
5. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "time_init" function in the "arch/microblaze/kernel/timer.c" file.
6. It first checks if the "system-timer" property exists in the chosen node using the "of_get_property" function.
7. If the property exists, it retrieves the handle specified in the property using the "of_find_node_by_phandle" function.
8. If the property does not exist, it prints an informational message stating that no chosen timer was found and the default behavior will be used.
9. If the timer handle is still not set, it falls back to the previous behavior by finding the first compatible node using the "of_find_compatible_node" function.
10. Finally, the patch sets the "timer_baseaddr" variable based on the "reg" property of the timer node.

Overall, this patch adds a useful capability to the microblaze architecture and provides flexibility in selecting the system timer. It also includes proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds DMA resume capability to the Skylake ASoC Intel driver. This capability allows the driver to resume the DMA position when a stream is suspended and resumed.

2. In the "SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_RESUME" case, the patch prepares the substream and enables the DMA resume enable bit for the stream. It also sets the dpib and lpib positions to resume before starting the DMA.

3. In the "SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_SUSPEND" case, the patch saves the dpib and lpib positions, and then decouples the stream.

4. The patch also includes other cases for triggering start and pause release, which are not directly related to the DMA resume capability.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a useful feature to the Skylake ASoC Intel driver by enabling DMA resume capability, which can improve the handling of suspended and resumed streams.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the default value for available voltages in the mxcmmc driver's mxcmci_probe function.

2. The mmc_regulator_get_supply() function is used to retrieve the available voltages. If the function returns an error code other than -EPROBE_DEFER, it means that available voltages were not provided.

3. In the current code, if available voltages are not provided, the ocr_avail mask is not set, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

4. The patch checks if mmc->ocr_avail is not set and then proceeds to fix it. If platform data (pdata) is available and provides ocr_avail, it is used. Otherwise, the default value MMC_VDD_32_33 | MMC_VDD_33_34 is assumed.

5. The patch also handles the case where mmc_regulator_get_supply() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, indicating that the supply is not yet available. In this case, the function jumps to the "out_free" label, which likely handles the cleanup and returns an appropriate error code.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and provides a reasonable default value for available voltages. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. Patch Changes:
   - The patch modifies the `watchdog_write` function in `watchdog_dev.c` to handle the error code returned by `watchdog_ping`.
   - It introduces a new variable `err` to store the error code.
   - After calling `watchdog_ping`, the patch checks if `err` is less than 0 (indicating an error) and returns the error code if so.
   - Similarly, the patch modifies the `watchdog_ioctl` function to handle the error code returned by `watchdog_ping`.

3. Rationale:
   - By propagating the ping error code to the user space, the patch ensures that the watchdog daemon is informed about possible hardware errors or unregistered device drivers.
   - This improves the overall reliability and stability of the watchdog functionality.

4. The `set_queue_count` function is modified to use the `nvme_set_features` function instead of `nvme_get_features` to correctly set the number of queues.

5. The `nvme_dev_add` function is modified to remove the unnecessary `NULL` parameter in the `nvme_get_features` function call.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness of setting the number of queues in the NVMe driver by using the appropriate function and opcode. It also removes unnecessary parameters and improves code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch marks the functions `ft_tpg_alloc_fabric_acl()`, `ft_register_configfs()`, and `ft_deregister_configfs()` as static in `tcm_fc/tfc_conf.c`. This is done because these functions are not used outside of this file. Marking them as static improves code organization and reduces the risk of accidental usage from other parts of the codebase.

1. The patch adds a new function `lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay` in the `lpfc_init.c` file. This function is responsible for configuring the EQ delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing using `MODIFY_EQ_DELAY` for all EQs created.

2. In the `lpfc_sli4_queue_setup` function, the newly added `lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay` function is called in a loop to configure the EQ delay multiplier for all EQs created. The loop iterates over the EQ indices, incrementing by `LPFC_MAX_EQ_DELAY` each time.

3. The `lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay` function is defined in the `lpfc_sli.c` file. It takes a `startq` parameter of type `uint32_t` and performs the necessary operations to modify the EQ delay multiplier.

4. The `lpfc_eq_create` function in the `lpfc_sli4.h` file is modified to set the delay multiplier to 0 using the `bf_set` macro. This ensures that the delay multiplier is not set during EQ creation.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the EQ delay multiplier in the lpfc driver. It introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to properly configure the delay multiplier.

2. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and the related code that sets and uses this member.

3. The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is modified to take an additional argument "freq" which represents the bus frequency. This function calculates the clock divider based on the provided frequency and sets it accordingly.

4. The "meson_i2c_xfer" function no longer calls "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" since the clock divider is now set in the probe function.

5. In the "meson_i2c_probe" function, the "clock-frequency" property is read from the device tree, and if it is not found, the default frequency is used. The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is called with the frequency value obtained from the device tree.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency of the i2c-meson driver by setting the clock divider only once during the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer. This change reduces unnecessary calculations and improves performance.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch changes the log level from error (dev_err) to debug (dev_dbg) for certain error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer size validation failures. This change is intended to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with unnecessary error messages.

2. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues. It only modifies the log level for existing error messages.

3. The change is relatively low-risk as it only affects the log messages and does not modify any critical functionality or behavior of the code.

4. The patch has been reviewed by Tomi Valkeinen, who is a recognized contributor in the drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/omap_fb.c area.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static.
   - This change restricts the scope of the variable to the scsi_debug.c file only.
   - Since "pseudo_primary" is only used in scsi_debug.c, making it static is a good practice to encapsulate its usage within the file.

2. The patch includes proper sign-offs and reviews.
   - It is important to have sign-offs from the author and reviewed-by tags from other contributors.
   - In this case, the patch includes sign-offs from Akinobu Mita and James Bottomley, as well as reviewed-by tags from Douglas Gilbert and Martin K. Petersen.
   - This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals, increasing its reliability.

3. The patch modifies the scsi_debug_init() function.
   - The change itself is a simple modification of the "pseudo_primary" variable declaration, making it static.
   - This modification does not introduce any new functionality or alter the existing behavior of the function.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a simple and safe modification that improves code encapsulation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "ALSA: asihpi: Deletion of an unnecessary check before the function call 'vfree'". It suggests removing an unnecessary check before calling the 'vfree' function.

The patch author explains that the 'vfree' function already performs input parameter validation, making the test around the call redundant. This redundancy can be safely removed.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Markus Elfring and Takashi Iwai, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

The code change itself is straightforward. It replaces the if statement that checks if 'pa->p_buffer' is not NULL before calling 'vfree' with a direct call to 'vfree(pa->p_buffer)'.

Given that the patch removes unnecessary code and has been reviewed and signed-off, it is reasonable to conclude that it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a straightforward code refactoring. It moves the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` from the header file `smil.h` to the file `smilsub.c`, where it is used. It also removes the unnecessary declaration of `ErrXDCode` in `smilmain.c`.

Since this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be considered a clean-up or maintenance patch. It does not have any potential to introduce regressions or impact the stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "KVM: VMX: Improve error reporting during invalid guest state emulation." It suggests improving the error reporting mechanism when instruction emulation fails in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module for Intel VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions) architecture.

The patch modifies the handle_invalid_guest_state() function in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file. In the current implementation, if the instruction emulation fails (err != EMULATE_DONE), the function simply returns 0 without providing any specific error information to userspace.

The patch adds the following lines of code to address this issue:
```
vcpu->run->exit_reason = KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR;
vcpu->run->internal.suberror = KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION;
vcpu->run->internal.ndata = 0;
```
These lines set the exit_reason, suberror, and ndata fields of the vcpu->run structure, which is used to communicate information between the kernel and userspace. By setting the exit_reason to KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR and suberror to KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION, the patch provides a clear indication that an internal error occurred during instruction emulation.

Overall, this patch improves error reporting during invalid guest state emulation by properly reporting the error to userspace. It enhances the debugging and troubleshooting capabilities for KVM users and developers.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch modifies the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` in the `net/ipv6/raw.c` file.
2. The patch changes the function signature to include a `struct msghdr *msg` parameter instead of using `void *from` and `int length` separately.
3. The patch updates the code to use `msg->msg_iter.iov` instead of `from` for the `memcpy_fromiovecend()` call.
4. The patch also updates the function call to `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` in the `rawv6_sendmsg()` function to pass the `msg` parameter instead of casting `msg->msg_iter.iov` to `struct iovec *`.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a correct and necessary change. It improves the code by using the `msg` parameter directly instead of relying on casting and separate parameters. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: Currently, when `isl29028_set_als_scale()` fails, the failure message is logged by the callers. This patch moves the logging into `isl29028_set_als_scale()` itself, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

2. The patch is signed-off by the original author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The changes made in the patch are straightforward and do not introduce any new functionality or major modifications. It simply moves the logging code to a more appropriate location.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: In a recent commit, two bitrates (22Mbps and 72Mbps) were removed from the supported bitrate array, reducing the number of bitrates from 14 to 12.

2. The patch initializes the ".n_bitrates" field to the size of the "mwifiex_rates" array instead of hardcoding it to 14. This ensures that the correct number of bitrates is reflected in the ".n_bitrates" field.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author and maintainers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

4. The change is localized to the "mwifiex/cfg80211.c" file and does not appear to have any significant impact on other parts of the kernel.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary correction. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new field called "has_ibs" to the "sclp_info" structure in "arch/s390/include/asm/sclp.h". This field is used to detect the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility.

2. In "drivers/s390/char/sclp_early.c", the patch updates the "sclp_facilities_detect" function to set the "has_ibs" flag based on the value of "sccb->fac117 & 0x20". This ensures that the presence of the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility is correctly detected.

3. The patch also includes the necessary "Reviewed-by" and "Signed-off-by" tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers.

4. The change is specific to the s390 architecture, which suggests that it is not a generic change that could potentially impact other architectures negatively.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid addition to the Linux kernel and should be accepted in -stable releases.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` which checks the readiness of the device. It reads a register value and returns whether the device is ready or not.

2. In the `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_init` function, the `dev_ready` function is assigned to the `dev_ready` field of the `nand_chip` structure. This means that the newly added `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` function will be used to check the device readiness.

3. Additionally, the `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure is set to 50. This value represents the delay in microseconds between chip operations.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's why:

- The patch adds a necessary function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` to check the device readiness, which is important for proper operation.

- The `dev_ready` function is correctly assigned to the `dev_ready` field of the `nand_chip` structure, ensuring that the device readiness check is used.

- The `chip_delay` value of 50 is set, which provides an appropriate delay between chip operations.

Overall, this patch adds necessary functionality and improves the stability of the Linux kernel for devices using the bcm47xxnflash driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure in the qce_crypto_driver. The "owner" field is used to specify the module that owns the driver. However, in this case, it is not necessary to explicitly set the "owner" field because the driver core will automatically populate it.

Removing the assignment of the "owner" field does not affect the functionality of the driver. It simplifies the code by removing unnecessary lines and reduces the risk of potential bugs related to the "owner" field.

Therefore, considering that the patch improves code simplicity and does not impact the functionality of the driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "[media] tm6000: Use a 16 scancode bitmask for IR". This suggests that the patch aims to modify the IR functionality of the tm6000 driver in the media subsystem.

2. The patch description states that using a 16 scancode bitmask for IR will allow the use of 24 or 32 bits NEC IR decoding tables with the tm6000 devices. This implies that the current implementation does not support these decoding tables.

3. The patch author is Mauro Carvalho Chehab, a well-known and respected contributor to the Linux kernel.

4. The patch modifies the "tm6000-input.c" file in the "drivers/media/video/tm6000" directory.

5. The specific change made in the patch is adding the line "rc->scanmask = 0xffff;" to set the scanmask to a 16-bit bitmask. This change is necessary to support NEC remotes with 24 or 32 bits.

6. The patch does not introduce any new code or functionality but rather modifies an existing code snippet.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary modification to support NEC remotes with 24 or 32 bits. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the firmware image filename for the xc4000 tuner driver. Renaming the filename to something that makes more sense for public release is a good practice as it improves clarity and maintainability.

2. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the authors. This adds credibility to the patch.

3. The change in the firmware filename is well-documented in a comment. The comment explains that the last version digit is an internal build number, allowing for firmware revision even if the core Xceive firmware remains unchanged. This provides useful information about the change and its purpose.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. It is a relatively simple change that improves the naming of the firmware image file.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe modification that improves the clarity and maintainability of the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch is titled "tty: serial: Fix termios/port flags mismatch." This suggests that it addresses a bug or inconsistency related to termios and port flags in the serial driver.

2. The patch is signed-off by Peter Hurley and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The patch modifies the `uart_change_speed` function in `serial_core.c`. This function is responsible for changing the speed of the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) device.

4. The patch adds a call to `uport->ops->set_termios` before setting the flags based on the termios cflag. This ensures that the port driver's `.set_termios` method is called before modifying the flags.

5. The patch also adds a line to reload the cflag from termios after calling `uart_change_speed`. This is necessary because the port driver may have overridden the flags.

6. The changes made by the patch appear to address a potential mismatch between the termios settings and the port flags, ensuring that they are properly synchronized.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to fix a bug and improve the synchronization between termios settings and port flags in the serial driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the `qos_request` field from the `saa7134_fh` structure to the `saa7134_dev` structure. This change makes sense because `qos_request` is a global field and not specific to a file handle.

2. In the `saa7134_streamon` function, the `pm_qos_add_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is added to the correct `qos_request` field.

3. Similarly, in the `saa7134_streamoff` function, the `pm_qos_remove_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is removed from the correct `qos_request` field.

4. In the `saa7134_fh` structure, the `qos_request` field is removed since it is no longer needed.

5. In the `saa7134_dev` structure, the `qos_request` field is added to replace the one removed from `saa7134_fh`. This change ensures that the `qos_request` field is available at the device level.

Overall, the patch improves the organization and clarity of the code by moving the `qos_request` field to the appropriate structure. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the `scan_read_raw_oob()` function in the `nand_bbt.c` file.
2. The patch introduces a check for ECC errors when scanning for simple bad block markers.
3. Previously, ECC errors would cause the function to return an error code, but with this patch, ECC errors are ignored when checking for bad block markers.
4. The patch checks the return value of `mtd->read_oob()` and returns 0 if the error code is -EUCLEAN or -EBADMSG, indicating an ECC error.
5. Similarly, the patch modifies the `scan_block_fast()` function to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers.
6. The patch ensures that ECC errors are not treated as errors when scanning for bad block markers, as it assumes that the relevant markers are still non-0xFF for true bad blocks.

Overall, this patch improves the handling of ECC errors during the scanning process for bad block markers. It does not introduce any new issues and is a reasonable enhancement to the existing code. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is specific to the MIPS architecture, specifically the Sibyte platform.

2. The patch moves the bus watcher initialization from the deprecated __initcall to device_initcall.

3. The __initcall macro is used to mark functions that are only called during the initialization phase and are not needed afterwards. However, it has been deprecated in favor of device_initcall.

4. The device_initcall macro is used to register functions that need to be called during device initialization. It ensures that the function is called after all devices have been registered.

5. The change from __initcall to device_initcall suggests that the bus watcher function may have dependencies on device initialization or may need to be called after all devices have been registered.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug. It is a code refactoring to improve the initialization process.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe change that improves the initialization process for the Sibyte platform. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch enables setting the minimum inline header mode for Virtual Functions (VFs) in the mlx5 driver.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to modify the minimum inline header mode for a specific VF.
   - The function sets the `min_inline` field in the `modify_nic_vport_context_in` structure and calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` to modify the VF's context.
   - The patch also adds the declaration of the new function in `vport.h`.

3. Impact and Justification:
   - This patch provides a new feature to set the minimum inline header mode for VFs, which can improve network performance.
   - The patch does not introduce any new dependencies or affect existing functionality.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a useful feature without any known negative impact.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes a problem where the auto defragmentation process continues to run even when the file system is frozen.

2. The patch adds two new lines of code to the function `__btrfs_run_defrag_inode` in the `fs/btrfs/file.c` file.

3. The `sb_start_write` function is called to acquire a write lock on the superblock.

4. The `btrfs_defrag_file` function is called to perform the defragmentation on the given inode.

5. The `sb_end_write` function is called to release the write lock on the superblock.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific issue where the auto defragmentation process continues to run even when the file system is frozen. By acquiring a write lock on the superblock before performing the defragmentation and releasing it afterward, the patch ensures that the auto defragmentation process is halted during a freeze operation, as intended.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and further testing and review may be necessary before applying the patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to simplify the ternary operators in the mwifiex_config_scan function in the mwifiex/scan.c file. It replaces the ternary operators with the GNU extension "x ?: y" syntax, which simplifies the code.

The patch has been reviewed by Julian Calaby and signed-off by Andreas Fenkart and Kalle Valo, indicating that it has undergone a review process and received approval from other developers.

The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of the code. It only simplifies the existing code, making it more concise and easier to read.

Considering the simplicity and non-intrusive nature of the patch, along with the positive review and sign-off, it is reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to clean up manual bias level transitions in the ASoC adau17x1 CODEC driver. This indicates a code improvement and can lead to better maintainability.

2. The patch replaces the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the suspend function and SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in the resume function with the suspend_bias_off flag. This change makes the code shorter and cleaner.

3. The patch modifies the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures to set the suspend_bias_off flag to true. This ensures that the CODEC driver's suspend_bias_off flag is set correctly.

4. The patch removes the adau17x1_suspend function, which was previously used to set the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF during suspend. This function is no longer needed since the suspend_bias_off flag is used instead.

5. The adau17x1_resume function remains and is used to handle the resume operation. It also includes a call to regcache_sync to synchronize the register cache.

6. The adau17x1_suspend function declaration is removed from the adau17x1.h header file since it is no longer used.

Overall, the patch improves the code by simplifying the bias level transitions and removing unnecessary functions. It also ensures that the suspend_bias_off flag is set correctly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch adjusts the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. This change is aimed at improving the encoded output using the default settings.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers from Samsung, indicating that it has gone through review and testing.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the default values of the MAX_QP and GOP size encoder parameters. The new default values are set to firmware recommended values, which suggests that they have been tested and found to provide better encoding output.

4. Impact: The changes made by the patch are limited to the default values of encoder parameters. This means that existing applications using the s5p-mfc driver will not be affected unless they explicitly rely on the previous default values.

5. Testing: The patch does not mention any specific testing performed, but since it is signed-off by multiple developers, it can be assumed that it has undergone appropriate testing.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement to the s5p-mfc driver and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward removal of the `.owner` and `.bus` fields for the `b53_spi_driver` structure in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver. The rationale for this removal is that the `module_spi_driver()` function is used, which automatically sets these fields.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of these fields seems to be a clean and appropriate change, as it aligns with the usage of `module_spi_driver()` and eliminates redundant code.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the format string specifier used in two debug print statements in the `hid-cp2112.c` file. It replaces the `%d` specifier with `%zd` for the `size_t` variables `size` and `read_length`.

Using the correct format specifier is important for maintaining code correctness and avoiding potential issues. `%zd` is the correct specifier for `size_t` variables, as it ensures proper printing of the value without any potential truncation or undefined behavior.

By making this change, the patch ensures that the debug print statements accurately display the values of `size` and `read_length` when debugging the HID CP2112 driver. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of the driver.

Since this patch is a simple fix that improves code correctness and readability without introducing any new risks or regressions, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, we need to understand its purpose and potential impact on the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The patch is related to the "drm/nva3/fb/ram" driver in the Nouveau GPU driver subsystem.

2. The changes in this patch modify the initialization of certain registers in the "nva3_ram_ctor" function.

3. The original code initializes three registers directly using the "ramfuc_reg" function.

4. The patch replaces the initialization of three registers with the "ramfuc_stride" function, which takes an additional argument, "ram->base.part_mask".

5. The "ramfuc_stride" function calculates the register value based on the given stride, which is multiplied by the "ram->base.part_mask" value.

6. The patch also modifies the initialization of one more register, "ram->fuc.r_0x1110e0", using the "ramfuc_stride" function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's why:

- The patch appears to be a bug fix or an improvement to the existing code. It replaces direct register initialization with a more flexible and dynamic approach using the "ramfuc_stride" function.

- The changes seem to be specific to the "nva3/fb/ram" driver and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

- The patch does not introduce any obvious risks or potential regressions. It seems to be a straightforward and safe modification.

However, it's important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch code. A more comprehensive review, including testing and consideration of the broader context, would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event`. This change is made because the name `pga_event` was misleading. Renaming the function to `out_drv_event` provides a more accurate description of its purpose.

2. The `out_drv_event` function is an event handler used with the OUT_DRV widgets. It is responsible for handling events related to the output drivers.

3. The patch updates the usage of the renamed function `out_drv_event` in the DAPM widgets. It replaces the previous usage of `pga_event` with `out_drv_event` for the HF Left Driver, HF Right Driver, HS Left Driver, HS Right Driver, and Earphone Driver widgets.

4. The patch removes the `mute` variable from the `struct twl6040_output`. However, this change does not seem to be related to the renaming of the function and widgets.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward renaming of the function and updating its usage in the relevant widgets. It does not introduce any significant changes or potential issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by other developers, which adds to its credibility.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch is titled "drivers:tty:fix up ENOIOCTLCMD error handling." This suggests that it addresses an issue related to error handling in the tty driver.

2. The commit message mentions that Linus pointed out that ENOIOCTLCMD should be translated as ENOTTY to user mode. This indicates that there was an incorrect translation of the error code, and the patch aims to fix it.

3. The patch includes a code snippet that demonstrates the issue. It shows that when an invalid ioctl command is passed to the tty driver, the errno should be ENOTTY instead of EINVAL.

4. The patch modifies the code in the tty_ioctl function by changing the return value from -EINVAL to -ENOTTY when retval is -ENOIOCTLCMD. This aligns the error handling with the correct translation.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a correct fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward removal of the __devexit_p macro usage. The __devexit_p macro is used to annotate functions that are only used during device initialization and can be discarded after that. However, with the removal of CONFIG_HOTPLUG, the __devexit_p macro is no longer necessary.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the __devexit_p macro is a clean-up change that aligns with the removal of CONFIG_HOTPLUG and does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch sets the led_classdev max_brightness to the maximum level supported by the hardware. This eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in brightness_set(), resulting in improved efficiency.

2. The patch removes the bright_max variable, which is no longer needed since the max_brightness value is now directly set from the template.

3. The netxbig_led_set() function is modified to directly set the brightness value without performing any conversion calculations. This simplifies the code and improves performance.

4. The create_netxbig_led() function is updated to set the max_brightness value from the template, ensuring that the correct maximum brightness level is used.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency and simplifies the code by eliminating unnecessary calculations and variables. It also ensures that the maximum brightness level is correctly set. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This prefix indicates that the function is only called from functions annotated with __init, which are executed during the kernel initialization phase. This change allows the kernel to make use of this hint and potentially free up resources after its usage.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only adds the __init prefix and renames the function.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Daniel Borkmann, Hannes Frederic Sowa, and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The patch is a small and focused change that improves resource management during kernel initialization.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial change that can be included in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are resource-managed functions provided by the kernel. This conversion helps reduce code size and simplifies the code. The use of devm_kzalloc instead of kzalloc ensures that the allocated memory is automatically freed when the device is unregistered, eliminating the need for manual memory deallocation.

The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or alter the existing behavior. They only improve the code by using more efficient and recommended kernel functions.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Guenter Roeck, indicating that it has undergone some level of testing and verification.

Therefore, considering the benefits of reduced code size, simplified code, and the absence of any functional changes, it is advisable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `regmap_init_i2c()` with `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. The `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` function is device-managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup. This change improves the overall code quality.

2. The patch fixes a potential bug by adding an explicit `regmap_exit` call, which was missing in the original code. This ensures proper cleanup and avoids any resource leaks.

3. The patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Sachin Kamat and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by them.

4. The change is localized to the `wm8960.c` file, specifically in the `wm8960_i2c_probe()` function.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the rtc-imxdi.c file. The typo is corrected from "Temperatur tamper detected" to "Temperature tamper detected". 

Considering that this is a trivial fix and does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks from the `moboard_uart0_init()` and `moboard_uart0_exit()` functions in `mach-mx31moboard.c`. These callbacks were previously used to initialize and clean up the platform device.

2. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function now directly performs the initialization tasks previously done in the `init()` callback.

3. The `moboard_uart0_exit()` function is removed, and the cleanup tasks are now handled within the `moboard_uart0_init()` function.

4. The `uart0_pdata` structure in `mach-mx31moboard.c` no longer contains the `init` and `exit` fields, as they are no longer used.

5. In `mx31moboard_init()`, the `moboard_uart0_init()` function is called to perform the initialization of UART0.

6. In `serial_imx_probe()`, the `pdata->init()` callback is no longer called, as the initialization tasks are now handled within `moboard_uart0_init()`.

7. The `serial_imx_remove()` function no longer calls `pdata->exit()`, as the cleanup tasks are now handled within `moboard_uart0_init()`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch removes unnecessary platform callbacks and simplifies the initialization and cleanup process for the UART0 device. The changes do not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it simplifies the code without introducing any regressions.
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, we need to understand its purpose and the changes it introduces. 

The patch is titled "rt2800: initialize BBP_R103 on all subroutines (except 5592)" and is signed-off by Stanislaw Gruszka. It modifies the `rt2800_init_bbp` function in the `rt2800lib.c` file.

The patch adds code to initialize the `BBP_R103` register in various subroutines of the `rt2800` driver. The `BBP_R103` register controls certain behavior of the wireless device. The patch sets the value of `BBP_R103` to `0xc0` in some cases and `0x00` in others.

The patch also includes Acked-by tags from Helmut Schaa and Gertjan van Wingerde, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on this information, we can proceed with the analysis.

1. The patch initializes the `BBP_R103` register in multiple subroutines of the `rt2800` driver. This suggests that the register needs to be properly initialized for correct operation.

2. The patch sets the value of `BBP_R103` to `0xc0` in some cases and `0x00` in others. The specific conditions for choosing the value are based on the wireless device's revision number (`rt2x00_rt_rev_gte`) and the device type (`rt2x00_rt`).

3. The patch includes Acked-by tags from two individuals, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses the initialization of the `BBP_R103` register in various subroutines, ensuring proper behavior of the wireless device. The approval from the reviewers further supports its inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the VIDIOC_TRY_FMT function in the coda.c file of the media subsystem. The issue is related to the calculation of the sizeimage field in the v4l2_format structure.

2. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the sizeimage field as the product of height and bytesperline, instead of width, height, and the YUV420 factor (3/2).

3. The patch corrects the calculation by setting the sizeimage field as the product of width, height, and the YUV420 factor (3/2).

4. The patch also updates the vidioc_s_fmt function to use the sizeimage field directly from the v4l2_format structure, instead of calculating it separately based on the format.

5. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the respective contributors.

6. The changes made by the patch are localized to the coda.c file and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC. This change allows for better parameter handling and documentation.

2. The patch introduces a new module parameter named "tx_buffers" to set the number of transmit USB buffers. This parameter is defined as an integer and has a default value of TX_DESC_DEF0 (64).

3. The patch also adds a MODULE_PARM_DESC for the "tx_buffers" parameter, providing a description for users.

4. In the device_set_options function, the patch modifies the setting of the "cbTD" variable, which represents the number of transmit USB buffers. Instead of using the TX_DESC_DEF0 value directly, it checks if the user-set "tx_buffers" value is within the defined limits (CB_MIN_TX_DESC and CB_MAX_TX_DESC). If the value is within the limits, it sets "cbTD" to the user-set value; otherwise, it falls back to the default value (TX_DESC_DEF0).

5. The patch does not introduce any new potential issues or regressions. It improves the parameter handling and allows users to set the number of transmit USB buffers within defined limits.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using devm_* APIs, which are device managed and simplify the code. This is generally a good practice as it helps with resource management and reduces the chances of resource leaks.

2. The patch replaces the allocation of the iio device with devm_iio_device_alloc, which is a device-managed allocation. This ensures that the memory is automatically freed when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

3. The patch replaces the usage of regulator_get with devm_regulator_get, which is a device-managed regulator acquisition. This ensures that the regulator is automatically released when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

4. The patch replaces the usage of request_threaded_irq with devm_request_threaded_irq, which is a device-managed IRQ request. This ensures that the IRQ is automatically freed when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

5. The patch removes unnecessary error handling code related to freeing the IRQ and putting the regulator. Since the devm_* APIs handle the resource management automatically, there is no need for explicit cleanup.

Overall, the patch improves resource management and simplifies the code. It follows best practices for device management in the Linux kernel. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations. This change improves code organization and makes it consistent with other subsystems like `fsl_msi`.

2. The patch iterates over all controllers and populates them with the MSI operations. This ensures that the MSI operations are correctly set up for each controller.

3. The patch assigns the `u3msi_setup_msi_irqs` and `u3msi_teardown_msi_irqs` functions to the `setup_msi_irqs` and `teardown_msi_irqs` fields of the `controller_ops` structure for each PCI controller. This ensures that the correct MSI setup and teardown functions are used for each controller.

4. The patch also includes proper error handling by checking the return value of `mpic_msi_init_allocator` and returning an error code if initialization fails.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-implemented and improves the code organization and consistency. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch replaces a call to the deprecated function `devm_request_and_ioremap` with the recommended function `devm_ioremap_resource`. This change ensures that the codebase is up to date with the latest best practices and avoids using deprecated functions.

2. The patch was found using the `coccicheck` tool and a semantic patch, which indicates that it has undergone automated testing and verification.

3. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors and an `Acked-by` tag from another contributor, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals.

4. The code changes in the patch are straightforward and do not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. It simply replaces one function call with another, ensuring that the code continues to function correctly.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to avoid an unnecessary register read in the i40e_virtchnl_pf.c file of the i40e driver.

2. The current code reads the I40E_PF_VT_PFALLOC register to obtain the base VF id and then calculates the absolute VF id by adding the VF id to the value obtained from the register.

3. The patch replaces the register read with a direct access to the base VF id stored in the hw->func_caps.vf_base_id field.

4. By using the stored base VF id directly, the patch eliminates the need for an unnecessary register read, improving performance and reducing overhead.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple Intel developers and has also been tested.

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid optimization that improves the code and does not introduce any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary. This optimization is beneficial when there are no starved devices, as there is no need to iterate over them.

2. The patch splits the scsi_run_queue function into two separate functions: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue. This improves code clarity and makes the functions more focused on their specific tasks.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Christoph Hellwig, Hannes Reinecke, and James Bottomley. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

4. The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or alter existing behavior. They only optimize the code by avoiding unnecessary lock acquisition.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a reasonable optimization that improves performance without introducing any risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code cleanup and renaming of a function in the staging/comedi/drivers/ni_at_ao.c file. The patch renames the function `atao_ao_rinsn` to `atao_ao_insn_read` for better grep compatibility and follows the normal format for analog output read back functions.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be categorized as a clean-up or maintenance patch. Such patches are generally accepted in stable releases to improve code readability and maintainability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` field from the `sl811h_driver` structure in the `sl811-hcd.c` file. The patch claims that there is no need to set the `.owner` field explicitly because the core will handle it automatically.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. The purpose of the `.owner` field: The `.owner` field is used to keep track of the module that "owns" the driver structure. It is typically set to `THIS_MODULE` to ensure that the module is not unloaded while the driver is still in use.

2. The impact of removing the `.owner` field: If the `.owner` field is removed, it means that the ownership tracking mechanism will not be in place. This could potentially lead to issues if the module is unloaded while the driver is still being used.

3. The rationale provided in the patch: The patch claims that there is no need to set the `.owner` field explicitly because the core will handle it automatically. However, it does not provide any specific details or references to support this claim.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend a NAK (not accepting) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. Removing the `.owner` field without providing a clear rationale or evidence that the core will handle it automatically could introduce potential issues and instability. It would be safer to keep the `.owner` field in place to ensure proper ownership tracking of the driver structure.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch is modifying the ARM AMBA driver for the NetX platform in the Linux kernel.

2. The change is removing the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field of the amba_device structure.

3. The NO_IRQ initializer is typically used when a device does not have an associated interrupt line. However, in this case, the NETX_IRQ_LCD value is already specified as the interrupt.

4. Removing the NO_IRQ initializer simplifies the code and makes it more consistent with other device initializations in the same file.

5. The change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only removes an unnecessary initializer.

6. The patch has been signed-off by Russell King, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a straightforward and safe improvement to the code. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes the unnecessary platform data related to SPI bus clocks in the ARM Samsung platform. 

The patch removes the spi_src_clks array and the src_clk_name field from the s3c64xx_spi_info structure in the s3c64xx-spi.h header file. It also removes similar arrays and fields from other spi.c files in different ARM Samsung platforms.

Since the patch removes unnecessary code and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be considered a cleanup patch. Cleanup patches are generally safe to include in stable releases as they improve code readability and maintainability without introducing any risks.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function called `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function takes two parameters: `struct net *net` and `int ifindex`.

3. Inside the function, it first checks if the `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0.

4. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device associated with the given `ifindex`.

5. If the device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the l3mdev master index associated with the device.

6. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the l3mdev master index.

7. Additionally, the patch also adds a duplicate function `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` with an empty implementation that always returns 0. This duplicate function is present in the original code and is not modified by the patch.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) in Linux -stable releases. The patch adds a useful helper function that allows for efficient lookup of the l3mdev master index given a device index. The implementation appears to be correct and does not introduce any regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an uninitialized variable warning in the tca6507 LED driver.
2. The patch adds a check for the return value of the choose_times() function, which indicates whether "c1" and "c2" have been initialized.
3. If choose_times() returns -EINVAL, indicating that "c1" and "c2" haven't been initialized, the patch returns without further execution.
4. The dev_dbg() statement is not affected by this change and remains intact.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue related to uninitialized variables and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a function called "ced_transfer_flags()" in the staging driver "ced1401". The purpose of the function is to set transfer flags for a specific device.

2. The patch renames the variable "iReturn" to "ret" for better readability and adherence to coding conventions.

3. The patch also adds comments to explain the purpose of the flags being set in the "ret" variable.

4. The patch replaces the bitwise OR assignment operator "|=" with a simple assignment operator "=" since the flags are being set individually.

5. The patch ensures that the "U14TF_USB2" flag is set if the device is USB2.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the function. It only improves code readability and adherence to coding conventions.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary improvement to the code. It does not introduce any potential regressions or issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow warning in the btrfs file system's send functionality.
2. The expression "sizeof(*arg->clone_sources) * arg->clone_sources_count" is checked for potential overflow.
3. If the multiplication of "sizeof(*arg->clone_sources)" and "arg->clone_sources_count" exceeds the maximum value of ULLONG_MAX, an error (-EINVAL) is returned.
4. This check ensures that the allocation size for "arg->clone_sources" does not overflow and avoids potential memory corruption or security vulnerabilities.
5. The patch also includes appropriate sign-offs and review acknowledgments.

Considering the patch's purpose of silencing a non-serious warning and preventing potential issues, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch moves the DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk for alc255 from the SND_PCI_QUIRK section to the SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK section.
2. The SND_PCI_QUIRK entries for the DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk are removed.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's why:

1. The patch moves the quirk from the SND_PCI_QUIRK section to the SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK section. This suggests that the quirk is more related to pin configuration rather than PCI-specific behavior. Moving it to the correct section improves code organization and maintainability.
2. The removal of the SND_PCI_QUIRK entries for the DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk indicates that the quirk is no longer needed in the PCI quirk section. This removal aligns with the change made in the SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK section.

Overall, the patch improves code organization and removes unnecessary entries, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds support for using PCI MSIs (Message Signaled Interrupts) in the rt2x00pci driver. MSIs are a more efficient way of handling interrupts compared to traditional interrupt mechanisms.

2. The patch enables MSI support by calling `pci_enable_msi(pci_dev)` in the `rt2x00pci_probe` function. This ensures that MSIs are used whenever possible.

3. In case of a failure to allocate hardware resources (`ieee80211_alloc_hw`), the patch includes an error handling path. It disables MSI support by calling `pci_disable_msi(pci_dev)` before releasing resources and returning an error.

4. In the `rt2x00pci_remove` function, the patch also disables MSI support by calling `pci_disable_msi(pci_dev)` before freeing resources.

Overall, the patch adds support for using PCI MSIs in the rt2x00pci driver and properly handles error cases. Since MSIs are a more efficient interrupt mechanism, this patch improves the performance of the driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a type mismatch issue in the `capi20_manufacturer` function. The function is declared with an `unsigned int` argument, but it is called with an `unsigned long` argument. The patch corrects the function prototype to match the actual argument type used in the user-visible API.

2. The patch is signed-off by the original author, Tilman Schmidt, and also by David S. Miller, who is a well-known Linux kernel developer.

3. The issue was spotted with Coverity, which is a widely used static analysis tool for finding defects in code.

4. The patch modifies the `capi20_manufacturer` function to use `unsigned long` instead of `unsigned int` for the `cmd` argument.

5. The patch also updates the error message in the `default` case of the `capi20_manufacturer` function to print the correct value of `cmd` using `%lu` format specifier.

4. In the kbtab_probe function, the intf parameter is assigned to kbtab->intf, ensuring that the USB interface is properly stored in the kbtab structure.

Overall, the patch appears to fix the dev_* messages to use the correct USB interface device instead of the input device. This change improves the accuracy and clarity of the log messages and error reporting. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch removes the usage of BUG_ON macro from the mmc_ext_csd_open function in debugfs.c. The BUG_ON macro is used to trigger a kernel panic if a condition is not met. In this case, it checks if the value of 'n' is equal to EXT_CSD_STR_LEN.

2. Instead of triggering a kernel panic, the patch introduces an error handling mechanism. If 'n' is not equal to EXT_CSD_STR_LEN, it sets the 'err' variable to -EINVAL (invalid argument) and jumps to the 'out_free' label to free allocated resources.

3. The patch propagates the error value (-EINVAL) to the caller, indicating that there was an invalid argument.

4. The patch also maintains the existing functionality of allocating and assigning the 'buf' pointer to filp->private_data.

Based on this analysis, the patch improves the error handling mechanism by returning an error value instead of triggering a kernel panic. It also maintains the existing functionality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch modifies the `sirfsoc_uart_set_termios` function to recalculate the `clk_div_reg` when `ioclk` is not 150MHz. This ensures that the baud rate is set correctly for platforms with different `ioclk` frequencies.

2. The patch adds code to get the `clk` in the `sirfsoc_uart_probe` function and store it in the `sirfport` structure. It also enables and retrieves the `uartclk` rate from the `clk`.

3. The patch adds code to disable and put the `clk` in the `sirfsoc_uart_remove` function.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's why:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue where the fast lookup table to set the baud rate is only accurate when `ioclk` is 150MHz. By recalculating the `clk_div_reg` when `ioclk` is not 150MHz, the patch ensures correct baud rate settings for platforms with different `ioclk` frequencies.

2. The patch adds necessary code to handle the `clk` in the probe and remove functions. This ensures proper handling of the `clk` resource, enabling and disabling it as required.

3. The changes made by the patch are specific to the `sirfsoc_uart` driver and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the variable "num_drc_entries" from an unsigned int to an atomic_t. This change allows for atomic operations on the variable, eliminating the need for spinlocking around it.

2. The patch updates the decrement operation "--num_drc_entries" to "atomic_dec(&num_drc_entries)" and the increment operation "++num_drc_entries" to "atomic_inc(&num_drc_entries)". These atomic operations ensure that the variable is modified atomically, preventing race conditions.

3. The patch also updates the initialization of "num_drc_entries" from "num_drc_entries = 0" to "atomic_set(&num_drc_entries, 0)". This initializes the atomic variable correctly.

4. The patch modifies the code that checks the number of cache entries and the maximum cache size to use atomic_read(&num_drc_entries) instead of directly accessing "num_drc_entries". This ensures that the value is read atomically.

5. The patch updates the cache statistics printing to use atomic_read(&num_drc_entries) instead of directly accessing "num_drc_entries". This ensures that the value is read atomically.

Overall, the patch improves the thread-safety of the "num_drc_entries" variable by converting it to an atomic type and using atomic operations. This change eliminates the need for spinlocking and ensures correct behavior in a multi-threaded environment. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The reason for exporting `confirm_error_lock` is to allow the use of `eeh_serialize_lock()` and `eeh_serialize_unlock()` functions to freeze the affected PE (PCIe Endpoint) in the PCI surprise hot remove path. This suggests that the patch is introducing a necessary functionality to handle error reporting and locking in the powerpc/eeh subsystem.

3. The patch has been signed-off by two developers, Gavin Shan and Michael Ellerman, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

4. The change itself is relatively small and localized to the `eeh.c` file, which reduces the risk of introducing unintended side effects.

2. The `media_graph_walk_iter()` function handles the iteration logic of the graph walk, while `media_graph_walk_next()` serves as a wrapper function to call `media_graph_walk_iter()`.

3. The code changes in `media_graph_walk_iter()` are straightforward and do not introduce any new complexity or potential issues. It iterates through the links of the current entity, checks if the link is enabled, retrieves the entity at the other end of the link, checks if it has already been visited, and pushes it onto the stack if not.

4. The modified `media_graph_walk_next()` function now simply calls `media_graph_walk_iter()` in a loop until there are no more entities on the current level. This simplifies the logic and improves code readability.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs and review tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and beneficial improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through the changes made and the rationale provided:

1. The patch adds a check for `sp->role.invalid` in `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page` before calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`. This check is suggested by Gleb Natapov in an email.

2. The patch also suggests adding a check for `is_obsolete_sp()` in `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page` since `kvm_mmu_invalidate_all_pages()` already calls `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` after incrementing `mmu_valid_gen`.

3. The patch includes comments explaining that obsolete pages cannot be used on any vCPUs, referring to the comments in `kvm_mmu_invalidate_zap_all_pages()`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to optimize the `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page` function by avoiding unnecessary calls to `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` when the root page is zapped and is either invalid or obsolete.

Considering the rationale and the changes made, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It appears to improve the efficiency of the code without introducing any potential issues. However, it is always advisable to thoroughly test the patch before applying it to ensure its compatibility and stability with the existing codebase.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` with `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` in multiple places within the `lrw.c` file.

3. The `setkey()` function now uses `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` to determine the block size of the cipher.

4. The `crypt()` function also uses `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` to determine the block size of the cipher.

5. The `init_tfm()` function checks if the block size of the cipher is equal to `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` (16) instead of a hardcoded value of 16.

Overall, this patch improves code readability and maintainability by using a constant for the fixed block size of the LRW algorithm instead of relying on the `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` function. It ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors related to block size calculations.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch renames the argument "virq" to "irq" in the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map`. This change clarifies that the IRQ is not any more "virtual" than any other Linux IRQ number.

2. The patch updates the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map` to use the new argument name "irq" instead of "virq". This ensures consistency and removes the misleading "virtual" reference.

3. The patch also updates the calls to `irq_set_chip_data` and `irq_set_chip_and_handler` to use the new "irq" argument instead of "virq". This ensures that the correct IRQ data is set for the given hardware.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity and removes unnecessary references to "virtual" IRQs. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch introduces a condition to set the `MNT_LOCKED` flag on the newly cloned mount if the `CL_UNPRIVILEGED` flag is set and either the `CL_EXPIRE` flag is not set or the `old->mnt_expire` list is empty.

3. The purpose of setting the `MNT_LOCKED` flag is to prevent unprivileged users from revealing what is under a mount.

4. By checking the `CL_EXPIRE` flag and the `old->mnt_expire` list, the patch ensures that the `old->mnt_expiry` value is only considered if the `CL_EXPIRE` flag is set.

5. This change ensures that the `old->mnt_expiry` value is ignored when not explicitly requested, preventing any unintended behavior.

6. The patch is signed-off by "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

2. The patch replaces the "int" type with "unsigned int" for loop variables in three functions: pt_regs_to_gdb_regs, gdb_regs_to_pt_regs, and sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs. This change ensures that the loop variables are of the same type as the values they are being compared to, eliminating the sign-compare warnings.

3. The patch also includes the Signed-off-by line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch is a straightforward fix that resolves compiler warnings without introducing any new functionality or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a warning generated during the kernel build with W=1. This warning indicates that there is no previous prototype for the 'ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg' function in the ql4_nx.c file.

2. The function 'ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg' is only used within the file in which it is declared and does not require a declaration. Therefore, it can be made static.

3. The patch marks the 'ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg' function as static, which limits its visibility to only the file in which it is declared.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Nilesh Javali <nilesh.javali@qlogic.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a relevant expert.

The patch modifies the "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6" in "include/net/netns/ipv6.h" to include the new knobs "idgen_retries" and "idgen_delay." It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c" and adds them to the sysctl table in "net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c."

In "net/ipv6/addrconf.c," the patch modifies the "addrconf_dad_failure" function to use the new knobs when calling "addrconf_mod_dad_work."

In "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c," the patch modifies the initialization of the "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6" to set the default values for the new knobs.

Overall, this patch introduces new knobs to control the behavior of stable address generation in the IPv6 subsystem. It aligns with RFC 7217 and provides more flexibility in configuring the generation of stable addresses.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` to the `filter.h` file. This is a good practice as it aligns with the location of other core code declarations, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.

2. The patch also adds an `extern` declaration for `bpf_jit_enable` in the `filter.h` file. This ensures that the variable is properly declared and accessible throughout the codebase.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing code logic. It only moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` and adds an `extern` declaration. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs or regressions.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to avoid auto-mute or auto-mic of retasked jacks. This is important because when a jack is retasked as a different direction (e.g., a mic jack used as a CLFE output), it shouldn't be counted as the target for automatic jack switching.

2. The patch introduces a check to skip the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed. This ensures that retasked jacks are not affected by automatic jack switching.

3. The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` function to skip pins that have been retasked as inputs. This prevents these pins from being detected as present during the jack detection process.

4. The patch also modifies the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function to skip pins that have been retasked as outputs. This prevents these pins from triggering the autoswitch behavior.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of retasked jacks being incorrectly detected and affected by automatic jack switching. It introduces necessary checks to ensure that retasked pins are correctly handled. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is specific to the m68k architecture, which means it won't affect other architectures.
2. The patch addresses a compilation error in the `drivers/block/blockconsole.c` file, specifically in the `bcon_advance_console_bytes` function.
3. The error is caused by an implicit declaration of the `cmpxchg64` function, which is missing when `CONFIG_RMW_INSNS` is enabled.
4. The patch adds the missing `cmpxchg64` function by mapping it to `cmpxchg64_local`, which is already mapped to `__cmpxchg64_local_generic`.
5. The patch includes the necessary changes in the `arch/m68k/include/asm/cmpxchg.h` file.
6. The patch is signed-off by Geert Uytterhoeven, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a compilation error specific to the m68k architecture. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses the issue of calculating the address of query 8 based on the presence of query registers. This is important because if a touchpad does not report relative data, query 6 will not be present, and the address of query 8 will be one less.

2. The patch removes the hardcoded offset for query 8 and introduces a calculation to determine its location dynamically.

3. The patch is signed-off by Andrew Duggan and Jiri Kosina, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

4. The code changes are within the hid-rmi.c file, specifically in the rmi_populate_f11() function.

5. The patch checks if gestures are present and then reads query 8 to determine if query 10 exists. This ensures that the correct query offset is calculated.

6. The patch handles error cases by returning the appropriate error code and displaying an error message.

Overall, the patch improves the accuracy of calculating the address of query 8 based on the presence of query registers. It is a targeted fix that addresses a specific issue and does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch moves the 64-bit feature fixup earlier in the code, specifically to the `early_setup()` function. This is done to ensure that the feature fixups are applied before turning on the MMU, as they can impact the assembly paths related to MMU management and interrupts.

2. The patch aligns the behavior of 64-bit with what is already done for 32-bit.

3. The `apply_feature_fixups()` function is called in `early_setup()` to apply all the dynamic patching.

4. The `setup_system()` function, which is called later in the code, no longer calls `apply_feature_fixups()` since it has already been called in `early_setup()`.

Overall, this patch ensures that the feature fixups are applied at the appropriate time and aligns the behavior of 64-bit with 32-bit. It does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially cause instability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the zl10353_read_snr() function in the zl10353.c file under the drivers/media/dvb/frontends directory.

2. The purpose of the patch is to change the way SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is reported. Instead of using raw hardware register values, the patch suggests reporting SNR in a 0.1 dB scale.

3. The patch achieves this by modifying the calculation of the SNR value. It replaces the line "*snr = (_snr << 8) | _snr;" with "*snr = 10 * _snr / 8;". This new calculation converts the raw SNR value to a 0.1 dB scale.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have tested and approved the changes.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues. It is a relatively small and straightforward modification.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe change that improves the reporting of SNR values. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds more register documentation to the renesas-irqc driver, which improves the clarity and understanding of the code.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

3. The patch also includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list, providing additional context and transparency.

4. The changes made in the patch are related to defining and documenting register addresses and constants used in the driver. These changes do not introduce any functional modifications or potential issues.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward documentation improvement, which is generally considered safe for inclusion in stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is a fix for a "line over 80" issue in the comedi driver for the adv_pci1710 device. The fix involves removing a comment that was causing the issue.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a straightforward and low-risk change. It does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. Instead, it addresses a coding style issue by removing a comment that exceeds the recommended line length.

Given that this patch is a simple fix and does not have any potential negative impact on the stability or functionality of the Linux kernel, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. This indicates that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the spi-rspi driver.

2. The error message in the build log indicates that the 'rspi_of_match' symbol is undeclared, causing the build to fail. The patch resolves this issue by defining 'rspi_of_match' as NULL when CONFIG_OF is not set.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to the 'rspi_parse_dt' function, which is responsible for parsing device tree information. When CONFIG_OF is not set, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid argument.

4. The patch is signed-off by two individuals, Yoshihiro Shimoda and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a build error and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the "toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store" function in the "toshiba-apci.c" file. The change is in the if condition that checks the value of the "mode" variable.

Before the patch, the condition was:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 && (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

After the patch, the condition becomes:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1  || (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

The change replaces the logical AND operator (`&&`) with the logical OR operator (`||`). This means that the condition will now return true if either the sscanf function fails to read an integer from the "buf" string or if the "mode" variable is not equal to 2 or 1.

The original condition was incorrect because it would always evaluate to true. If the "mode" variable is not equal to 2, it will be equal to 1, and vice versa. Therefore, the condition would never be false.

The modified condition fixes this issue by using the logical OR operator, which allows the condition to be true if either part of the condition is true. This change ensures that the condition will be false only if the sscanf function fails to read an integer from the "buf" string.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a possible bug in the original code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the use of the SPI_BPW_MASK macro at appropriate places in two different files: spi-bfin-v3.c and spi-ti-qspi.c. This macro is used to set the bits_per_word_mask field of the spi_master structure.

2. In both files, the bits_per_word_mask field is currently set using individual BIT macros for 32, 16, and 8 bits. The patch replaces these individual macros with the SPI_BPW_MASK macro, which is a more concise and readable way of setting the bits_per_word_mask field.

3. The SPI_BPW_MASK macro is a standard macro defined in the Linux kernel's spi.h header file. It takes the number of bits as an argument and returns the corresponding bitmask. This ensures that the bits_per_word_mask field is set correctly for the supported number of bits.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the code. It only improves the code readability and maintainability by using the SPI_BPW_MASK macro.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

4. The patch improves code readability and maintainability by using the `file_inode()` helper function.

5. The change does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug. It is a clean-up and improvement to the existing code.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial change that improves code quality without introducing any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch constifies the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops. This means that these structures are not modified by the driver and can be made const.

2. The struct regmap_config is used as an argument to regmap_init(), which accepts a pointer to const. Therefore, making it const is appropriate.

3. The struct regulator_ops is used for the tps65023_dcdc_ops and tps65023_ldo_ops variables. These variables define the operations permitted on VDCDCx and LDOx regulators. Since these operations are not modified by the driver, making the struct const is reasonable.

4. The tps65023_regmap_config variable is of type struct regmap_config and is also not modified by the driver. Making it const is appropriate.

Overall, the patch constifies the necessary structures and does not introduce any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch adds a check to the ath_chanctx_adjust_tbtt_delta() function in the ath9k driver's channel.c file.
2. The added check verifies if the previous channel's switch_after_beacon flag is not set, and if so, it returns without adjusting the TBTT (Target Beacon Transmission Time) delta.
3. If the switch_after_beacon flag is set, it proceeds to adjust the TBTT delta based on the current and previous channel's TSF (Time Synchronization Function) values.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's why:

1. The patch introduces a necessary check to ensure that the TBTT delta is adjusted only when the previous channel is in GO/AP (Group Owner/Access Point) mode in MCC (Multi-Channel Concurrency) mode.
2. By skipping the adjustment when the switch_after_beacon flag is not set, the patch avoids unnecessary TBTT delta adjustments in scenarios where it is not required.
3. This change improves the accuracy and efficiency of the TBTT delta adjustment process in the ath9k driver.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid and beneficial improvement to the ath9k driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The patch modifies the omap_32k_read_sched_clock() function to return a 64-bit value instead of a 32-bit value. This change aligns with the updated sched_clock interface.

4. The patch replaces the setup_sched_clock() function call with sched_clock_register(). This ensures that the updated omap_32k_read_sched_clock() function is registered as the scheduler clock source.

5. The patch also registers the persistent clock and provides an informational message.

Overall, the patch appears to be a necessary update to support the 64-bit sched_clock interface on the ARM OMAP platform. It follows the proper conventions and does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed by the kernel's resource management framework. This helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

2. The devm_kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the thermal_data structure. This function automatically handles memory deallocation when the device is unregistered, eliminating the need for manual memory freeing.

3. The error handling in the probe function has been simplified. Instead of using goto statements, the patch directly returns the error code when necessary. This improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch removes the manual freeing of memory in the error handling paths of the probe and remove functions. This is because the devm_ functions automatically handle memory deallocation, so there is no need for explicit freeing.

Overall, the patch improves code size, simplifies error handling, and utilizes the devm_ functions for better resource management. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch removes the extra call to the function `i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()` in the `do_cmd` function of the `adl_pci9111` driver.

2. The `do_cmdtest` function already calls `i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()` to validate the `cmd->convert_arg` value. This call sets the `dev_private` 'div1' and 'div2' values needed to program the 8254 timer.

3. Since the `do_cmdtest` function already sets the required values, there is no need to call `i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()` again in the `do_cmd` function.

4. By removing the redundant call, the patch simplifies the code and improves its efficiency.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by H Hartley Sweeten and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone proper review and testing.

Based on these considerations, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward removal of redundant code in the ASoC wm8904 driver. The patch removes the duplicate addition of routes for the core_intercon in the wm8904_add_widgets() function.

Considering that the patch only removes redundant code and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be considered a clean-up or maintenance patch. Such patches are generally accepted in stable releases to improve code quality and reduce unnecessary complexity.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a lockdep_assert_held() call to the fence_signal_locked() function in the dma-buf/fence.c file. This function is responsible for signaling a fence, and the lockdep_assert_held() call ensures that the lock associated with the fence is held when this function is called.

2. The lockdep_assert_held() call is a debugging aid that checks if the specified lock is held by the current thread. It helps catch potential lock-related issues during development and testing.

3. The patch also includes the necessary error handling by returning -EINVAL if the fence pointer is NULL, which is a valid check to ensure the function is used correctly.

4. The patch has been reviewed by Chris Wilson and signed-off by Rob Clark and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone peer review and received approval from experienced developers.

5. The patch is hosted on the patchwork.freedesktop.org website, which is a reputable platform for submitting and reviewing patches related to the Linux kernel.

Considering all these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the dma-buf/fence.c file, adding a necessary lockdep_assert_held() call and proper error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch renames the camellia module to camellia_generic. This renaming allows optimized assembler implementations to autoload with module-alias. Renaming the module indicates that there might be changes or improvements in the implementation.

2. The patch modifies the Makefile to reflect the renaming. It replaces the previous camellia module with camellia_generic.o. This ensures that the new module is built and included in the kernel when the CONFIG_CRYPTO_CAMELLIA configuration option is enabled.

3. The patch adds a module alias for camellia. This alias allows the module to be autoloaded when a user requests the camellia algorithm. This is a useful addition for ease of use.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward renaming and configuration update, which should not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to distribute the default RSS (Receive Side Scaling) table uniformly over the rings of the close NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node, instead of all available channels. This change enforces a preference for close rings over far ones.

The patch modifies the function `mlx5e_build_default_indir_rqt` in the `en.h` file and adds an additional parameter `struct mlx5_core_dev *mdev` to the function. This parameter is then used to determine the NUMA node and the number of cores associated with it.

The patch also modifies the function `mlx5e_set_channels` in the `en_ethtool.c` file and adds the `priv->mdev` parameter to the `mlx5e_build_default_indir_rqt` function call.

Additionally, the patch modifies the function `mlx5e_build_netdev_priv` in the `en_main.c` file and adds the `mdev` parameter to the `mlx5e_build_default_indir_rqt` function call.

Based on the analysis of the patch, it appears to be a reasonable change that improves the distribution of the default RSS table over the rings of the close NUMA node. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch updates the declaration of `raid_table`, `raid_dir_table`, and `raid_root_table` to use the correct struct type `struct ctl_table`. This ensures type safety and consistency.

3. The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only removes unnecessary code and updates the struct type. Therefore, it is a safe and straightforward change.

4. The patch has been signed-off by Joe Perches and NeilBrown, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a relatively small update to the radeon ACPI header in the AMDGPU driver. The patch adds new definitions for ATPX, including ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

Therefore, the initial analysis suggests that this patch should be considered for acceptance in Linux -stable releases (ACK), pending a more detailed review by the Linux kernel maintainers.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `check_flush_dependency` which is responsible for checking the sanity of flush dependencies.
2. The `check_flush_dependency` function is called in two places: `flush_workqueue` and `start_flush_work`.
3. The purpose of the `check_flush_dependency` function is to verify that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items.
4. If the target workqueue does not have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set, the function triggers a warning using `WARN_ONCE`.
5. The warning messages provide information about the task or work item that is trying to flush the non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue, as well as the name and function of the target workqueue or work item.
6. The patch ensures that memory reclaim or workqueues without WQ_MEM_RECLAIM do not break the forward-progress guarantee, which can lead to a deadlock.

Overall, this patch adds a necessary check to prevent potential deadlocks caused by memory reclaim trying to flush non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueues. It improves the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel, making it suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `dump_cnt` function in the `turbostat.c` file of the `tools/power/x86/turbostat` directory. The purpose of the patch is to make the debugging output of `turbostat` less verbose by only printing the counters that are active.

The changes made in the patch introduce a series of `if` statements to check if each counter is active before printing its value. If a counter is not active (i.e., its value is zero), it will not be printed. This reduces the verbosity of the debugging output.

The patch also adds a check at the beginning of the `dump_cnt` function to handle the case where the `cnt` pointer is `NULL`. If `cnt` is `NULL`, the function simply returns without performing any further operations.

Overall, the patch improves the readability of the debugging output by reducing unnecessary information and handling the case of a `NULL` pointer. It does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the existing code.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose and the changes it introduces, it seems appropriate to include it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the firmware UCODE_ID_STORAGE in the Tonga's virtualization environment.

6. The patch does not introduce any obvious regressions or potential issues.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is well-tested, addresses a specific issue, and has been reviewed by relevant experts. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc in the ftgmac100 driver. This separation is necessary because the ftgmac100 hardware revision in certain devices, like the Aspeed AST2500, no longer reserves all bits in RXDES#2 but instead uses the bottom 16 bits to store MAC frame metadata. This change helps avoid corruption.

2. The patch introduces a new member, `rx_pages`, in the `struct ftgmac100` to store the struct page pointers separately.

3. The `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page` function is modified to take an additional argument, `struct ftgmac100 *priv`, to access the `rx_pages` member.

4. The `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` function is also modified to take the `struct ftgmac100 *priv` argument to access the `rx_pages` member.

5. The `ftgmac100_rx_packet` function is updated to pass the `priv` argument to `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` when retrieving the page pointer.

6. The `ftgmac100_alloc_rx_page` and `ftgmac100_free_buffers` functions are modified to pass the `priv` argument to `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page` and `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` respectively.

Overall, the patch addresses the hardware-specific changes in the ftgmac100 driver and ensures proper separation of rx page storage from rxdesc. It also maintains backward compatibility with older hardware revisions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of the return value of seq_printf and converts it to check seq_has_overflowed instead. This change is in line with the upcoming modification of seq_printf to return void.

2. In the smi_ipmb_proc_show function, the return statement is replaced with seq_putc(m, '\n') and then followed by return seq_has_overflowed(m). This ensures that the overflow status of the sequence is checked before returning.

3. Similarly, in the smi_version_proc_show function, the return statement is replaced with seq_printf and then followed by return seq_has_overflowed(m). Again, this ensures that the overflow status is checked before returning.

4. The same pattern is followed in the smi_type_proc_show and smi_params_proc_show functions, where seq_printf is used followed by return seq_has_overflowed(m).

5. In the smi_type_proc_show function in the ipmi_ssif.c file, seq_puts is used instead of seq_printf, and then return seq_has_overflowed(m) is called. This maintains consistency with the other changes made in the patch.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable modification that aligns with the upcoming changes in seq_printf. It ensures that the overflow status is properly checked before returning, which is a good practice. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix for a debug log issue in the Bluetooth management code. The patch corrects the mixed-up values in the debug logs, ensuring that the expected and actual key counts are reported correctly.

4. The patch also has the Signed-off-by tags from Axel Lin and Mark Brown, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

5. The code changes are minimal and focused on improving the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection, which is a specific functionality of the tas5086 codec driver.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the tas5086 codec driver without introducing any significant risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch removes the configuration option "option[2]" which was used to enable/disable DMA (Direct Memory Access) in the addi-data drivers.
2. Instead of using the configuration option, the patch enables DMA if it is supported by the driver.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's why:

1. The patch removes a configuration option that is preventing the conversion of the addi-data drivers to the comedi auto attach mechanism. This suggests that the removal of the option is necessary for the progress of the driver.
2. Enabling DMA if it is supported by the driver is a more streamlined approach and aligns with the default behavior of enabling DMA when supported. This simplifies the code and removes the need for the configuration option.

Overall, the patch seems to improve the code by removing unnecessary configuration options and aligning with the default behavior. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch modifies the `comedi_driver_unregister()` function in the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers.c` file.

2. The change replaces the call to `comedi_dev_from_minor()` with `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver.

3. The purpose of this change is to increment the reference count of the device to prevent it from being removed while it is being checked if it is attached to the driver.

4. After the check is performed, the patch adds a call to `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change ensures that the reference count of the device is properly managed, preventing it from being removed while it is being checked for attachment to the driver. This improves the stability and reliability of the comedi driver.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a generic compatible string for the "hix5hd2" SoC name, which is the System-on-Chip name. This allows for the addition of a generic ethernet driver name.

5. The patch handles different cases for pressure and temperature readings, ensuring that the appropriate data is read and returned.

6. Error handling is improved by properly handling failures during device initialization and data reading. Instead of returning immediately, the patch breaks out of the switch statement and continues execution, allowing for proper cleanup and error reporting.

7. The patch includes proper locking using mutexes to ensure thread safety during device access.

8. The patch also includes error handling for invalid channel types, returning -EINVAL when an unsupported channel type is encountered.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-written and addresses a specific issue in the MPL3115 pressure sensor driver. It improves the reliability and accuracy of raw reads by properly handling direct mode and error conditions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch is titled "Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup error codes in hv.c". This suggests that it aims to improve error handling in the vmbus driver code.

2. The patch includes changes to the `hv_post_message` function in `hv.c`. This function is responsible for posting a message to the Hyper-V host.

3. In the original code, if the payload size exceeds the maximum allowed size (`HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT`), the function returns -1. This is not a descriptive error code and does not provide any information about the specific error.

4. The patch replaces the return value of -1 with the `EMSGSIZE` error code. `EMSGSIZE` is defined in `<errno.h>` and indicates that the message size is too large. This change provides a more meaningful error code, making it easier to understand and handle the error.

5. Additionally, the patch also handles the case where memory allocation fails (`kmalloc` returns NULL). In the original code, it also returns -1, which is not a specific error code. The patch changes the return value to `ENOMEM`, which indicates an out-of-memory error.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves error handling by using more descriptive error codes.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to error handling in the vmbus driver code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the potential problem of characters being dropped at close due to the missing implementation of chars_in_buffer in the sierra USB serial driver.

2. The patch adds the implementation of the sierra_chars_in_buffer function, which calculates the number of characters in the output buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBS (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

3. The implementation of sierra_chars_in_buffer is protected by a spin lock, ensuring thread safety.

4. The dev_dbg statement is added to provide debug information about the number of characters in the buffer.

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and the maintainer of the driver, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, this patch addresses a specific issue and provides a necessary implementation to prevent dropped characters at close. It also includes proper locking and debugging information. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

3. The `INTERVALS` macro is defined as `(1UL << INTERVAL_SHIFT)`, which calculates the number of intervals based on the shift value.
4. The `avg` and `stddev` variables are divided by the `divisor` to calculate the average and standard deviation, respectively.
5. The patch optimizes the division operation by using shifts instead of `do_div` when the `divisor` is equal to `INTERVALS`.
6. By using shifts instead of `do_div`, the patch takes advantage of the fact that the `divisor` is usually a power-of-two, resulting in faster calculations.
7. The patch also improves readability by using shifts explicitly instead of relying on `do_div` for power-of-two divisors.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of calculating averages in the cpuidle menu governor by using shifts where possible. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the uprobes/x86 code.

2. The current implementation of arch_uprobe_pre_xol() assumes that the ->pre_xol() hook cannot fail. However, the patch acknowledges that this assumption is incorrect and that arch_uprobe_pre_xol() needs to be fixed.

3. The patch introduces a check for the presence of the ->pre_xol() hook. If it exists, the patch calls it and checks for any error. If an error occurs, the patch returns the error to allow for a proper restart.

4. After the ->pre_xol() hook is called (if it exists), the patch sets the instruction pointer (ip) to the xol_vaddr value in the uprobe_task structure.

5. The patch also saves the current thread's trap_nr value and sets it to UPROBE_TRAP_NR.

6. Additionally, the patch checks if the TIF_BLOCKSTEP flag is set for the current task and clears it if necessary.

7. Finally, the patch removes the redundant call to ->pre_xol() that was present before the check for its existence.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a known issue and improves the functionality of the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function by correctly handling the failure case of the ->pre_xol() hook.

1. The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver.

2. Instead of using 'ai_continuous', the patch suggests determining the value of 'ai_continuous' from the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure.

3. The patch updates the 'usbduxfast_ai_interrupt' function to use the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure to check if the acquisition is continuous or not.

4. The patch also removes the assignment of 'ai_continuous' in the 'usbduxfast_ai_cmd' function.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch simplifies the code by removing the 'ai_continuous' member and using the 'stop_src' member to determine the acquisition mode. This change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior, but rather improves the code by removing redundant variables.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drm/radeon/dpm` directory. This function allows forcing a performance level via sysfs.

2. The function takes two parameters: `rdev` (a pointer to the `radeon_device` structure) and `level` (an enum representing the desired forced performance level).

3. The function first retrieves the current power state and performance level of the device.

4. Depending on the `level` parameter, the function sends specific messages to the SMC (System Management Controller) to set the forced and enabled performance levels accordingly.

5. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_HIGH`, the function sets the enabled levels to 0 and the forced levels to 1.

6. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_LOW`, the function sets the forced levels to 0 and the enabled levels to the maximum performance level count minus 1.

7. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_AUTO`, the function sets both the forced and enabled levels to 0.

8. After setting the levels, the function updates the `forced_level` field in the `radeon_device` structure.

9. The function returns 0 on success and -EINVAL on failure.

10. The patch also adds a declaration of the `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` function in the `radeon_asic.h` file and assigns it to the `force_performance_level` field of the `cayman_asic` structure in the `radeon_asic.c` file.

11. The patch does not introduce any new dependencies or modify existing code in an unsafe manner.

1. The patch aims to enhance the jack connection decision logic for the nau8825 codec in the ASoC subsystem.

2. The patch introduces additional conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic.

3. The function `nau8825_is_jack_inserted` is modified to read the `NAU8825_REG_JACK_DET_CTRL` register and determine the jack polarity (active high or active low).

4. The variable `active_high` is set based on the jack polarity read from the register.

5. The variable `is_high` is set based on the status of the `NAU8825_GPIO2JD1` bit in the `NAU8825_REG_I2C_DEVICE_ID` register.

6. The patch then compares `active_high` with `is_high` to determine the jack connection status according to the jack insertion logic.

2. The patch is signed-off by Tero Kristo <t-kristo@ti.com> and Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers.

3. The code changes in the patch modify the _add_clkdev() function in omap_device.c.

4. The patch introduces a conditional check using the function of_have_populated_dt() to determine if the DT has been populated. This ensures that the code only executes when the DT data is available.

5. The patch retrieves the clock using clk_get_sys() and checks if it returns an error using IS_ERR(). If an error occurs and the DT has been populated, the patch uses of_clk_get_from_provider() to retrieve the clock.

6. If the clock retrieval is successful, the patch registers the clock using clk_register_clkdev() with the provided clock alias and device name.

7. If the clock retrieval fails or the DT has not been populated, the patch falls back to the existing behavior of using clk_add_alias() to add the clock alias.

8. The patch handles error cases by checking the return value of clk_add_alias() and provides appropriate error messages.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement that simplifies the clock alias creation process for OMAP2+ ARM devices. It introduces a conditional check to handle different scenarios and falls back to the existing behavior when necessary. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The percpu_ref_tryget() and percpu_ref_tryget_live() functions should return "true" only if they acquire a reference. However, the return value from atomic_long_inc_not_zero() is a long and may have high bits set, which can result in a reference leak.

2. Impact: The reference leak can occur when performing CPU hotplug during I/O, leading to hangs in blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait. This issue was observed in a specific scenario where percpu_ref_kill (blk_mq_freeze_queue_start) raced with percpu_ref_tryget (blk_mq_timeout_work).

3. Stack Trace: The provided stack trace indicates the point of failure and the potential race condition between percpu_ref_kill and percpu_ref_tryget.

4. Fix: The fix involves changing the return type of the tryget routines from int to bool, ensuring that the reference is correctly acquired and preventing the reference leak.

5. Fixes and Link: The patch references a previous commit that introduced the issue and provides a link to the bug report for further details.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to storing the status of registers in the s390/kvm code.
2. The patch explains that the current implementation may save stale versions of the ACRS/FPRS registers because the SIE state descriptor does not have fields for these registers, and they are stored in the host registers instead.
3. The patch proposes collecting the ACRS/FPRS registers before saving them to ensure that the saved values are up-to-date.
4. The patch also mentions that this fix resolves strange problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw, as the low-level machine check handler will revalidate all registers with the content of the save area.
5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and a CC to the stable mailing list, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Considering the provided information, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a clear solution. It also includes the necessary documentation and has been reviewed by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch and its description, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description:
   The patch addresses an issue where errors in `add_probe_trace_event()` are not properly handled when probing with a glob. This can lead to a segmentation fault if perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob.

2. Solution overview:
   The patch ensures that `add_probe_trace_event()` does not modify `tf->ntevs` and `tf->tevs` if the function fails. It also adds error handling to free allocated memory and clear the probe trace event in case of failure.

3. Patch details:
   - The patch modifies the `add_probe_trace_event()` function in `probe-finder.c`.
   - It adds a check for the return value of `convert_to_trace_point()` and `expand_probe_args()`.
   - If any of these functions fail, the patch clears the probe trace event, decrements `tf->ntevs`, frees the allocated memory, and returns the error code.

4. Impact assessment:
   The patch addresses a potential segmentation fault and ensures that the `tf->ntevs` and `tf->tevs` variables are not modified if `add_probe_trace_event()` fails. This improves the stability and reliability of the perf tool when probing with globs.

5. Testing:
   The patch includes a "Tested-by" tag, indicating that it has been tested by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo. However, the specific details of the testing are not provided in the patch description.

Based on the analysis above, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue described. It introduces error handling and prevents potential crashes. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function of `checkpoint.c`. This ensures that the `s_dirty` flag is checked and the checkpoint is skipped if it is not set. This is a necessary check to avoid unnecessary checkpointing.

2. The previous condition was incorrect as it did not consider the case where a checkpoint was already done and all the node pages were written back. The patch fixes this issue by introducing the correct condition.

3. The `write_checkpoint` function is responsible for performing the necessary block operations and then calling `do_checkpoint` to perform the actual checkpoint. After the checkpoint is completed, the `unblock_operations` function is called.

4. The `stat_inc_cp_count` function is called to increment the checkpoint count in the `stat_info` structure.

5. Finally, the `mutex_unlock` function is called to release the `cp_mutex` and the `trace_f2fs_write_checkpoint` function is called to trace the completion of the checkpoint.

6. In `super.c`, the patch removes the previous condition that checked `s_dirty` and `get_pages` before returning 0 in the `f2fs_sync_fs` function. This condition is no longer needed since the `write_checkpoint` function already checks `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex`.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness of the checkpointing process in the F2FS filesystem and removes unnecessary checks in the `f2fs_sync_fs` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition with hardware when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The patch adds a check after updating the hardware to ensure that the alarm time has not been surpassed. If it has, the alarm is rescheduled.

3. The patch also moves completed alarms to a separate list and executes their callbacks.

4. If there are no more pending alarms, the interrupt is shut down.

5. The patch includes a Signed-off-by line from the author and a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it has been tested and is suitable for stable releases.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a potential race condition and improve the handling of alarms in the driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

5. The patch includes relevant Cc's to Prarit Bhargava and Ingo Molnar, suggesting that it has been reviewed by other experts in the field.
6. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the LKML mailing list, providing additional context and transparency.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is well-documented, addresses a specific issue, and has undergone testing and review. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the provided information and the changes made in the code:

1. The patch addresses an issue specific to Access Points (AP) in the mwifiex driver.
2. When an AP is started with WEP security and an external station is connected, the data path works fine.
3. However, if the AP is restarted with WPA/WPA2 security, the station can connect but ping fails.
4. The driver skips the deletion of WEP keys if the interface type is AP, which is causing the issue.
5. Removing the redundant check resolves the problem.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a specific issue related to APs and improves the functionality of the mwifiex driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch: The patch aims to address the issue of a flood of "kevent may have been dropped" warnings generated by usbnet when something goes wrong. It introduces a ratelimit mechanism to control the rate of generating these warnings.

2. Mitigation of fallout: The patch acknowledges that there is an underlying problem in usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism, which can cause events to be dropped and not handled. However, this patch does not address the root cause but rather mitigates the fallout caused by the current implementation.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the `usbnet_defer_kevent` function by adding a ratelimit check before printing the warning message. If the ratelimit is not exceeded, the warning message is printed. Otherwise, it is suppressed.

4. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Steve Glendinning and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided mitigation, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the underlying problem in usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism should be addressed separately to ensure a more robust solution in the long term.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The current driver sets the request's dma addr (mReq->req.dma) to 0 to mark the DMA address as not valid. However, some gadget drivers set the request's dma addr to DMA_ADDR_INVALID to mark the address as invalid. This inconsistency leads to bogus data being sent because the ci13xxx_udc driver assumes the request has already been mapped.

2. Solution: This patch fixes the problem by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid.

3. Test: The patch has been tested by Pavankumar Kondeti and found to be working correctly.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the ci13xxx_udc.c file by adding a new define for DMA_ADDR_INVALID and updating the logic in several functions to use DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0.

Based on the analysis, the patch addresses a bug and provides a consistent approach for marking the DMA address as invalid. It has also been tested and found to be working correctly. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to reduce the memory footprint for debugging in the DRM Radeon driver.

2. The patch removes the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() function and replaces it with a kernel helper function, printk(), which can dump up to 64 bytes via printk(). In this case, the actual size is 15 bytes.

3. The hex_dump_to_buffer() function was previously used to print the contents of the 'dig_connector->dpcd' buffer. The patch replaces it with a more concise and efficient printk() statement: "DRM_DEBUG_KMS("DPCD: %*ph\n", (int)sizeof(dig_connector->dpcd), dig_connector->dpcd);". This printk() statement achieves the same result as the previous hex_dump_to_buffer() call.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the code. It only improves the memory footprint and simplifies the code by using a more appropriate kernel helper function.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch fixes unused return smatch warnings in the tcmu_netlink_event function in drivers/target/target_core_user.c.

2. The patch initializes the "ret" variable to -ENOMEM, which is the error code for out-of-memory conditions.

3. The patch checks if genlmsg_new fails to allocate a new sk_buff. If it fails, the patch returns the "ret" value (-ENOMEM) instead of -ENOMEM directly.

4. The patch checks if genlmsg_put fails to allocate space for the message header. If it fails, the patch jumps to the "free_skb" label, which frees the sk_buff and returns the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

5. The patch uses nla_put_string to add a string attribute to the sk_buff. If it fails, the patch jumps to the "free_skb" label, which frees the sk_buff and returns the "ret" value.

6. The patch uses nla_put_u32 to add a u32 attribute to the sk_buff. If it fails, the patch jumps to the "free_skb" label, which frees the sk_buff and returns the "ret" value.

7. The patch calls genlmsg_end to finalize the message and checks if it fails. If it fails, the patch jumps to the "free_skb" label, which frees the sk_buff and returns the "ret" value.

8. Finally, the patch calls genlmsg_multicast to send the message and returns the "ret" value.

The patch handles error conditions properly by freeing the sk_buff and returning the appropriate error code. It also fixes the missing semicolon mentioned in the patch description.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

4. The changes made in the patch modify the "limits->max_perf" value by using the "round_up" function with the "FRAC_BITS" parameter. This change ensures that the "limits->max_perf" value is rounded up correctly.

5. The patch also includes a comment explaining the purpose of the code change, which helps with code understanding and maintenance.

Considering all these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid and beneficial improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the S25FL127S nor flash part. It mentions that each writing to the configuration register takes a significant amount of time, during which no more accesses to the flash should be done.

2. The patch adds a wait loop after the register writing until the flash finishes its work. This ensures that no further accesses to the flash are made during this time, preventing any potential issues.

3. The patch also includes error handling in case there is a timeout while writing the configuration register. It logs an error message and returns an appropriate error code.

4. The patch performs a read-back and check of the configuration register to verify that the quad enable bit has been set correctly.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the flash part and adds necessary wait and error handling to prevent potential failures. Therefore, it seems suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue description: The patch addresses a reported issue where a sigbus error occurs when running a specific fio job file with a device dax alignment of 4KB or 2MB. The error does not occur when using a 1GB alignment.

2. Root cause analysis: The fault handling in the huge fault code fails to fallback when the fault size is larger than the device alignment or when a smaller mapping is already established.

3. Proposed solution: The patch introduces a simple change to force fallback until the fault size matches the alignment. It checks if the fault size is less than the device alignment and returns a sigbus error. If the fault size is greater than the alignment, it returns a fallback error. Additionally, it checks if the fault is outside the virtual memory area (VMA) and returns a sigbus error in that case as well.

4. Impact assessment: The proposed change ensures that the fault handling correctly handles faults that are larger than the device alignment or when a smaller mapping is already established. It provides a fix for the reported issue without introducing significant changes.

5. Testing: The patch includes a fio configuration file that can be used to reproduce the issue. The reported issue has been verified by the reporter, and the proposed solution has been tested.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch fixes an issue with the VLAN_TAG_PRESENT in the netvsc_recv_callback() function in the netvsc_drv.c file.

2. The issue is that the __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() function is being called unconditionally, which adds VLAN_TAG_PRESENT to the packet regardless of whether it comes from a VLAN or not.

3. The patch introduces a conditional check using the VLAN_TAG_PRESENT flag. If the flag is set in the packet's vlan_tci field, then __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() is called, ensuring that VLAN_TAG_PRESENT is added only when the packet comes from a VLAN.

4. The patch includes the Reported-by, Signed-off-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that the issue was reported by Olaf Hering, the patch was signed off by Haiyang Zhang and K. Y. Srinivasan, and it was reviewed by David S. Miller.

5. The patch modifies the netvsc_recv_callback() function by adding the conditional check and calling __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() only when necessary.

8. The patch also includes a call to `synchronize_net()` to ensure proper synchronization before removing the interface.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be well-tested, addresses a specific issue, and includes proper locking and cleanup mechanisms. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the analysis of the Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here are the reasons for my recommendation:

1. The patch addresses a warning raised by Dan Carpenter's static checker, indicating a potential issue with negative values for the "credits" variable.

2. The "credits" variable is currently defined as an int, but it receives a 32-bit unsigned integer value from the server. This can lead to an underflow if a large unsigned integer is planted by a malicious or broken server.

3. The patch proposes changing the data type of the "credits" variable from int to u32 (unsigned 32-bit integer), ensuring that it can store the received unsigned value without any underflow issues.

The patch modifies the 'exact_match' function by changing the comparison from 'a->dev_addr == a->dev_addr' to 'a->dev_addr == b->dev_addr'. This change ensures that the correct variables are compared.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a bug reported by cppcheck, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to clean up the init error handling in the ehv_bytechan driver for tty devices.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue where the driver registration fails due to running out of major numbers, which could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference.

3. The patch introduces proper error handling by using goto statements to jump to the appropriate error handling code paths.

4. In case the allocation of the tty driver fails, the patch jumps to the "err_free_bcs" label, which frees the allocated "bcs" memory and returns the error code.

5. If the registration of the tty driver fails, the patch jumps to the "err_put_tty_driver" label, which unregisters the driver and releases the allocated tty driver.

6. If the registration of the platform driver fails, the patch jumps to the "err_deregister_tty_driver" label, which unregisters the tty driver.

7. Finally, the patch returns the error code if any of the registration steps fail.

Overall, the patch improves the error handling in the ehv_bytechan driver, ensuring that the driver is properly deregistered and resources are freed in case of failure. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that there was a typo in the get_fmt callback, and the return value check from __find_format() was inverted by mistake.
2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the if condition was originally checking if `!format` (format is NULL), and if true, it would assign `fmt->format` with the value of `*format`. Otherwise, it would set `ret` to -EINVAL.
3. However, the patch mistakenly changes the condition to `if (format)` instead of `if (!format)`. This means that if `format` is not NULL, it will assign `fmt->format` with the value of `*format`, which is incorrect.
4. The patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the change, making it difficult to understand the intention behind the modification.
5. Considering the above points, it appears that the patch introduces a regression by incorrectly modifying the return value check, which could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

Therefore, based on the analysis, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it is clear that the patch is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. The patch author, Chris Wilson, explains that the BUG_ON checks are a crude approximation and are too late to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state. The regression was introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16, and the patch is being sent to the stable mailing list.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the useless BUG_ON statement will not introduce any new issues and will prevent unnecessary crashes in the i915 driver.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the Xen pciback driver and the behavior of pci_dev->irq after calling pci_disable_device(). It explains that commit cffe0a2b5a34c95a4dadc9ec7132690a5b0f6687 resets pci_dev->irq to zero, which causes problems for the Xen pciback driver.

2. The patch is described as a hotfix for the 3.19 kernel version to avoid resetting pci_dev->irq. It also mentions that a proper fix will be prepared for the next merging window, indicating that this patch is a temporary solution.

3. The patch has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Sander Eikelenboom, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.

4. It includes appropriate Signed-off-by tags from the patch author and the maintainer, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch includes relevant Cc tags, indicating that it has been shared with relevant individuals who may have an interest or expertise in the affected code.

6. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), providing additional context and allowing for further review if needed.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the specific issue mentioned. However, it's important to note that this patch is considered a temporary fix, and a proper fix is expected in the future.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The need_this_block() function should not be called when there are more than 2 failed devices, as it may try to index beyond the end of the failed_num[] and fdev[] arrays.

2. The patch limits the loops in need_this_block() to at most 2 iterations, ensuring that it doesn't index beyond the end of the arrays.

3. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Shaohua Li.

4. The patch is signed-off by NeilBrown, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by a reputable contributor. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: possible out-of-bounds access on non-DeviceTree (DT) platforms.
2. On non-DT platforms, the index of the serial device is incremented on each probe, even if a deferred probe occurs during the clock retrieval in s3c24xx_serial_init_port().
3. This index is used to reference elements of the statically allocated s3c24xx_serial_ports array.
4. In case of a re-probe, the index can point outside of this array, leading to memory corruption.
5. The patch fixes this issue by incrementing the index only on a successful probe.
6. The issue was reported by Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz <b.zolnierkie@samsung.com>.
7. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the patch author and the maintainer.

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a recursive locking bug introduced in the imx_console_write() function.
   - The bug occurs when the spin_lock_irqsave() function is called recursively, leading to a deadlock.
   - The issue is not easily detectable because the printks do not appear on the serial console.

2. Solution: The patch proposes a solution to avoid locking in the sysrq case and use spin_trylock_irqsave() in the oops_in_progress case.
   - This approach is already used in other drivers and helps prevent similar bugs caused by copy/paste/modify errors.

3. Additional issue: The patch identifies another issue related to the port->sysrq indicator.
   - If port->sysrq is not reset, all console writes happen unlocked, making the current writer vulnerable to operations that modify the port.
   - The patch suggests introducing a separate indicator, port->sysrq_cpu, to address this issue.

4. Scope: The proposed solution for the additional issue goes beyond the scope of this fix and should be implemented in a common function to avoid copy/paste/modify bugs.

5. Testing: The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander <tim@krieglstein.org>.

Considering the provided analysis, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the recursive locking bug and improve the handling of the port->sysrq indicator.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by commit 96d1327ac2e3, which simplified the source code but introduced a race condition. The race condition occurs when the timer expires while another CPU is in the process of reactivating the timer, leading to accessing memory that has already been freed.

2. The proposed fix replaces the use of mod_timer with mod_timer_pending. This change ensures that the timer is only reactivated if it is not already pending, avoiding the race condition.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which helps in tracking the fix.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Liping Zhang and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch provides a valid fix for a known issue and has been reviewed by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a memory leak issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver version.
2. The current implementation of the stmmac driver reallocates all resources during the resume step but fails to release them during suspend.
3. The patch proposes a change in logic to avoid freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch, as the memory data will always be preserved.
4. The patch only reinitializes the descriptors and the rx/tx pointers during resume, which is a more efficient solution.
5. The patch has been tested on STi boxes, indicating that it has undergone testing and verification.
6. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the author and relevant individuals.
7. The patch modifies the stmmac_main.c file, which is the appropriate location for the changes.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch provides a valid and efficient solution to the memory leak issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to enable the firmware to pass beacons from foreign APs in AP mode. This is necessary to set the ht protection IE properly. It addresses a specific functionality requirement.

2. The patch adds the necessary filters for Group Owner (GO) mode as well. It appears that these filters were missing previously, possibly due to an oversight.

3. The patch modifies the filter_flags field in the cmd structure to include MAC_FILTER_IN_PROBE_REQUEST and MAC_FILTER_IN_BEACON flags. This ensures that probe requests and beacons from other APs are passed, which is required for ht protection.

4. The patch also includes the appropriate sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific functionality requirement and includes the necessary modifications to enable passing beacons from foreign APs in both AP and GO modes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) probes in the TCP protocol.

2. The patch fixes a bug where F-RTO may incorrectly send more probes if the next ACK advances SND_UNA (send unacknowledged) and does not sack new packets. This bug can cause the sender to continuously send new data instead of repairing holes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

3. The patch modifies the code to check if SND_NXT (send next) is greater than HIGH_SEQ (high sequence number). If it is, the patch checks if the FLAG_DATA_SACKED or is_dupack flags are set. If either of these flags is set, it sets the F-RTO flag to 0, indicating that the loss was real. This aligns with the behavior specified in the F-RTO RFC 5682, which limits the number of probes sent.

4. Additionally, the patch handles the case where FLAG_SND_UNA_ADVANCED is set and the recovery process has not yet occurred. In this case, it updates the HIGH_SEQ to SND_NXT and pushes pending frames.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific bug related to F-RTO probes and improves the behavior of the TCP protocol. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's consider the changes it introduces:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged.
2. The original commit mentioned that this change was made to prevent waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates.
3. The patch argues that there are better ways to fix the issue mentioned in the original commit.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend (A) accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch suggests that handling the special cases in the core is not the best approach and that the driver should decide when prepare_fb and cleanup_fb are noops. This change allows for more flexibility and potentially better solutions to the issue mentioned in the original commit.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the "radeon_drv.c" file. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

The comment suggests that there is a need to revisit how to properly support kexec within the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager). This indicates that the current implementation is problematic and needs further improvement.

The patch removes the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function and its associated call in the "radeon_kms_pci_driver" structure. This implies that the problematic code is being removed to address the race condition.

Considering the race condition and the need for further improvement, reverting the commit seems like a reasonable solution. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the estimation of Round Trip Time (RTT) in Fast Open for SYNACK packets.

2. The patch fixes a scenario where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

3. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

4. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to use the synack_stamp instead of tp->lsndtime to compute the SYNACK RTT.

5. Additionally, the patch introduces a check to update the SYNACK RTT only if tp->srtt is not set, which ensures that the smooth RTT computed in tcp_ack() is used when the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the Fast Open'd data packets sent in SYN_RECV.

6. The patch also initializes the synack_stamp variable in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function based on whether a request_sock is present or not.

7. Overall, the patch improves the accuracy of SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and avoids unnecessary RTT updates.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a reject for the MPC5121 platform if an input-only pin is requested to be set as an output. This is done to comply with the reference manual (18.3.1.1). This addition ensures that input-only pins cannot be mistakenly set as output pins.

2. The patch also rewrites the machine-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which improves scalability. This change aims to make the code more efficient and maintainable.

3. The patch includes the necessary sign-offs from the authors, indicating their agreement with the changes made.

4. The patch modifies the `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function to check if the requested GPIO pin is within the valid range for the MPC5121 platform. GPIO pins 28 to 31 are input-only on MPC5121, so attempting to set them as output pins should return an error (`-EINVAL`).

5. The `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function is modified to use the new `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` function for the `direction_output` callback if the device is compatible with the "fsl,mpc5121-gpio" device tree compatible string. Otherwise, it falls back to using the `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function. Similarly, the `get` callback is set based on the device compatibility.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds necessary checks to prevent incorrect usage of input-only pins and improves code efficiency and scalability.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm (memory management) in the Nouveau DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a specific resource, and it helps avoid the need for additional checks for the mm's existence throughout the codebase.

2. The patch modifies the `nouveau_mm_init` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/core/mm.c`. It introduces a conditional check for the length of the mm. If the length is non-zero, the offset and length calculations are performed as before. Otherwise, the offset and length are not calculated, effectively creating a zero-sized mm.

3. The patch also removes the `heap_size` variable from the `struct nouveau_mm` in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/include/core/mm.h`. This variable is no longer needed since the length calculation is skipped for zero-sized mms.

Overall, the patch introduces a useful feature and makes the necessary changes to support it. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a deadlock issue that can occur when using NVMe-oF with a small queue size (<32). The issue is caused by IB completions not being sent until the queue reaches 32, which can lead to a filled send queue.

2. Solution: The patch changes the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth instead of a fixed value. It removes the magic define and introduces a new function, `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit()`, to calculate the signaling limit based on the queue size.

3. Impact: The patch modifies the `nvme_rdma_post_send()` function to use the new signaling mechanism. It ensures that completion is signaled every queue depth/2 and handles the special case of a queue depth of 1, where signaling is required for every message.

4. Code quality: The patch includes relevant comments explaining the rationale behind the changes and acknowledges the original source of the code snippet. The code appears to be well-structured and follows the existing coding style.

5. Acknowledgments: The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Sagi Grimberg, indicating that it has received approval from a recognized expert in the field.

Considering the problem description, the proposed solution, the code quality, and the acknowledgment, it seems reasonable to accept this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `(HZ / 50)` with `msecs_to_jiffies(20)`. This change makes the code more explicit about the desired behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The use of `msecs_to_jiffies(20)` ensures that the delay is calculated correctly based on the system's timer resolution. This is important for maintaining consistent behavior across different systems.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Marek Vasut and Viresh Kumar. This indicates that the change has undergone a thorough review process and has received approval from experienced individuals.

4. The change is specific to the `stmpe-ts` driver in the `drivers/input/touchscreen` directory. It does not appear to have any potential negative impact on other parts of the kernel.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a straightforward and beneficial improvement. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

5. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch are minimal and focused on fixing the existing bug, reducing the risk of introducing new problems.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue Description: The patch addresses an issue where the DSS clock domain fails to transition from idle to active state when HDMI is enabled. This leads to the clock 'dss_48mhz_clk' being disabled, causing the HDMI PHY to fail when it tries to enable.

2. Patch Explanation: The patch ensures that the DSS clock domain is enabled before calling pm_runtime_get_sync() for the HDMI platform device. It adds a call to dss_runtime_get() before pm_runtime_get_sync() and complements it with dss_runtime_put() in hdmi_runtime_put().

3. Temporary Fix: The patch includes a comment stating that the added dss_runtime_get() and dss_runtime_put() calls are temporary and should be removed later. This suggests that a more comprehensive fix is planned for the future.

4. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by two developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

2. Solution: The patch fixes the compilation error by passing the value of 'ep->ep.maxpacket' instead of its address to the 'usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit' function.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Sachin Kamat <sachin.kamat@linaro.org> and reviewed by Robert Baldyga <r.baldyga@samsung.com>. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and testing.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the 's3c2410_udc_reinit' function in the s3c2410_udc.c file. It replaces the line that caused the compilation error with the corrected code.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the compilation error and has undergone review. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and the information given, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the memory allocated for struct request_queue needs to stay around until all blk_exit_rl() calls have finished. This indicates that there is a use-after-free issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The patch fixes a specific crash that is caused by a general protection fault. The crash is described in detail, including the stack trace, which helps in understanding the problem.

3. The Fixes tag references a specific commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear indication of the problem's origin.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been Acked by Tejun Heo, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by other developers.

5. The change is specific to the cavium-octeon MMC driver and does not affect other parts of the kernel.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the hang of direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN.
2. The patch correctly identifies that the increase of i_aiodio_unwritten should be done simultaneously with setting the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag.
3. The patch ensures that i_aiodio_unwritten is not increased when setting the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag, preventing it from going negative and causing processes to wait indefinitely.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including Eric Sandeen, Tao Ma, and Theodore Ts'o.
6. The patch includes the necessary changes in both inode.c and page-io.c files to address the issue comprehensively.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is well-tested, addresses a specific issue, and has been reviewed by multiple contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, my analysis is as follows:

The patch aims to prevent a lockdep warning in the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function in the IB/ipoib driver. The warning is caused by recursive calls to __ipoib_ib_dev_flush, which results in the vlan_rwsem lock being acquired multiple times.

To address this issue, the patch suggests using the down_read_nested function instead of down_read to prevent the lockdep warning. The down_read_nested function allows nested read locks to be acquired without triggering the warning.

The patch modifies the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function by adding an additional parameter, nesting, which is used to track the depth of recursion. The down_read_nested function is then called with the vlan_rwsem lock and the nesting parameter.

Furthermore, the patch updates the calls to __ipoib_ib_dev_flush in the ipoib_ib_dev_flush_light, ipoib_ib_dev_flush_normal, and ipoib_ib_dev_flush_heavy functions to pass the nesting parameter as well.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a lockdep warning and improves the locking behavior in the IB/ipoib driver.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in the Btrfs file system when read_tree_block() fails. The patch sets the tree_root->node to NULL when the read operation fails, preventing subsequent code from triggering the error.

2. The patch specifically fixes the issue in the s390 architecture, which was missed in a previous commit. By including this patch, we ensure that the fix is applied to the affected architecture.

3. The patch uses the oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() function to handle user input. The patch checks the return value of this function and returns an error if it is less than or equal to zero. This ensures that the uninitialized memory access issue is properly handled.

4. The patch includes changes to multiple functions (hw_interval_write, hwsampler_zero_write, hwsampler_kernel_write, hwsampler_user_write, and timer_enabled_write) that use oprofilefs_ulong_from_user(). These changes ensure that the fix is applied consistently across all affected functions.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Cc tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the author and should be considered for stable releases.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a valid issue and provides a proper fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch modifies the sctp_diag.c file in the net/sctp directory.

2. The patch addresses an issue where the sctp_diag module cannot rely solely on the TCPF_LISTEN flag to determine if listening sockets are requested.

3. The patch changes the condition in the sctp_ep_dump() function from `(r->idiag_states & ~TCPF_LISTEN) && !list_empty(&ep->asocs)` to `!(r->idiag_states & TCPF_LISTEN) && !list_empty(&ep->asocs)`. This change ensures that the condition is met when the TCPF_LISTEN flag is not set and the list of endpoint associations is not empty.

4. The patch also modifies the condition in the sctp_diag_dump() function from `!(idiag_states & ~TCPF_LISTEN)` to `!(idiag_states & ~(TCPF_LISTEN | TCPF_CLOSE))`. This change ensures that the condition is met when neither the TCPF_LISTEN nor the TCPF_CLOSE flags are set.

4. Code Analysis: The code change is made in the `happy_meal_sbus_probe_one` function. The existing check compares the name of the parent node in the OF tree with "sbus" to reject PCI devices. The patch modifies this check to also reject devices with the name "sbi".

5. Rationale: By extending the filter to reject devices with the name "sbi", the patch ensures that the SBus driver for Sun Happy Meal cards will not be loaded on PCI cards or SBus systems based on SBI SBus Bridges.

6. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Kjetil Oftedal and David S. Miller.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary modification to prevent the SBus driver from being loaded on incompatible systems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch is titled "KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-v2: Clear all dirty LRs." It suggests that the patch is related to the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures, specifically the vgic-v2 (Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller version 2) component.

2. The patch description explains that when saving the state of the list registers (LRs), it is critical to reset them to zero. Failure to do so could result in unexpected EOI (End of Interrupt) interrupts pending for virtual level interrupts.

3. The patch is marked as being suitable for stable releases starting from v4.6, indicating that it has been tested and deemed appropriate for inclusion in stable kernel versions.

4. The patch is signed-off by Christoffer Dall and Marc Zyngier, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

5. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the `save_lrs` function in the `vgic-v2-sr.c` file. It iterates over the list registers and clears their state if they are marked as dirty. If a register is not dirty, it reads its value from memory and then writes zero to it.

6. The changes made in the patch ensure that all list registers are properly cleared, preventing any pending interrupts from being left behind.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a critical issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the virtio console driver. It ensures that when a port is unplugged, all subsequent read operations return -ENODEV, indicating that the device is no longer available.

2. The patch fixes a bug where subsequent read operations would return 0, which does not indicate that the device went away. This could lead to confusion for users who are not monitoring the SIGIO signal.

3. The fix is implemented by checking the "guest_connected" flag, which indicates whether the port is still connected. If it is not connected, -ENODEV is returned immediately.

4. The patch also handles the case where the port is unplugged while waiting for data during a read operation. In this case, the read operation is interrupted, and -ENODEV is returned.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and is also marked for stable release.

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue Description:
   The patch addresses a deadlock issue between the chcp and thaw ioctls in the nilfs2 file system. The deadlock occurs when the thaw ioctl is called while the chcp command is waiting at nilfs_transaction_begin(). This deadlock is 100% reproducible.

2. Root Cause:
   The deadlock is caused by conflicting locks on sb->s_umount. The nilfs_ioctl_change_cpmode() function first locks sb->s_umount in read mode and then waits for unfreezing in nilfs_transaction_begin(). However, thaw_super() locks sb->s_umount in write mode, leading to the deadlock.

3. Solution:
   The patch replaces the usage of sb->s_umount in nilfs_ioctl_change_cpmode() with a dedicated mutex (ns_snapshot_mount_mutex) to protect snapshot mounts. This ensures exclusive access to snapshot mounts and resolves the deadlock issue.

4. Patch Details:
   - The patch modifies the nilfs_ioctl_change_cpmode() function in fs/nilfs2/ioctl.c and adds mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() calls instead of down_read() and up_read() calls on sb->s_umount.
   - It also modifies the nilfs_attach_snapshot() function in fs/nilfs2/super.c to acquire and release the ns_snapshot_mount_mutex.
   - Additionally, it initializes the ns_snapshot_mount_mutex in the_alloc_nilfs() function in fs/nilfs2/the_nilfs.c.

5. Sign-offs and Testing:
   The patch has been signed-off by the author and tested by the same person. It also includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags.

Considering the patch's purpose is to enable proper recognition and functionality of the Philips/NXP wireless adapter, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of BUG_ON() statements in the btrfs_map_block function. BUG_ON() statements are typically used to indicate a critical error condition that should never occur. However, in this case, the patch suggests that btrfs_map_block can encounter issues in the face of file system corruption. Therefore, removing the BUG_ON() statements seems reasonable.

2. The patch replaces the BUG_ON() statements with error handling code. If the offset is less than the stripe_offset, the patch logs an error message and returns -EINVAL. Similarly, if the stripe_index is greater than or equal to map->num_stripes, another error message is logged, and the function returns -EINVAL.

3. The error handling code added by the patch provides more informative error messages and gracefully handles the error conditions instead of causing a panic or crash.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch improves the error handling in btrfs_map_block and avoids unnecessary panics or crashes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch adds a check for a NULL pointer before accessing the smp pointer in the smp_conn_security() function. This check ensures that if the pointer is NULL, a proper error message is logged, and the function returns with an appropriate error code.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch also includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

5. The change is relatively small and isolated to the smp_conn_security() function, which reduces the risk of introducing new issues.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a potential bug and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the correct analysis for this Linux kernel patch is as follows:

The patch is fixing an obvious bug in the ALSA ctxfi driver related to the check of the dma_set_mask() call in cthw20k1.c. The original commit was incorrect, but it still worked for most machines by setting the DMA mask to 32-bit in the end. The severity of the bug is considered low.

Looking at the patch itself, it correctly fixes the bug by adding the missing "!" in the dma_set_mask() call check. This ensures that the DMA mask is set correctly.

Considering the nature of the bug and the correctness of the patch, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to handle invalid IPv4 and IPv6 packets consistently in the netfilter module. This is a desirable goal as it ensures uniform behavior across different IP versions.

2. The patch addresses the inconsistency between IPv4 and IPv6 conntrack modules. Previously, IPv6 conntrack marked invalid packets as INVALID and allowed the user to drop them explicitly, while IPv4 conntrack dropped such packets itself. The patch modifies the IPv4 conntrack module to mark invalid packets as INVALID and let the user drop them explicitly, aligning it with the IPv6 conntrack behavior.

3. The patch is signed-off by Jozsef Kadlecsik and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers.

4. The code changes in the patch are minimal and focused on handling invalid packets consistently. It modifies the return values in two places, returning -NF_ACCEPT instead of -NF_DROP when encountering certain conditions. This change ensures that the packet is not dropped automatically but is instead marked as invalid and left for the user to handle.

Overall, the patch addresses an inconsistency in the netfilter module and ensures consistent handling of invalid packets in both IPv4 and IPv6 conntrack modules. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: "While the driver is in the middle of a mailbox (MB) completion processing and it receives a spurious MB interrupt, it is mistaken as a good MB completion interrupt leading to premature completion of the next MB request." This issue can cause incorrect completion of MB requests.

2. The patch fixes the issue by adding a check to guard against spurious interrupts during MB processing. It checks the current state of MB processing and ignores the spurious interrupt. Additionally, it adds a stats counter to record this condition.

3. The patch is signed-off by the original author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the qlcnic driver in the drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlcnic directory.

5. The changes include modifications to the qlcnic_83xx_handle_aen() function, which handles asynchronous events, and the qlcnic_83xx_mailbox_worker() function, which processes mailbox commands.

6. The patch also adds a new stats counter, "mbx_spurious_intr," to the qlcnic_adapter_stats structure and updates the qlcnic_gstrings_stats array in qlcnic_ethtool.c to include this new counter.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue, provides a fix, and includes necessary updates. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the devfreq_add_device() function, which is responsible for adding a devfreq device to the system.
2. The bug occurs when the devfreq device does not have a default governor. If find_devfreq_governor() returns an error, devfreq_add_device() fails to add the devfreq instance.
3. The patch addresses this issue by checking if the governor returned by find_devfreq_governor() is an error. If it is, an error message is logged, and the function jumps to the error handling section.
4. If the governor is not an error, it is assigned to the devfreq device, and the event_handler() function of the governor is called to start the governor for the device.
5. If the event_handler() function returns an error, an error message is logged.

Overall, the patch fixes a bug that could prevent the addition of a devfreq device when a default governor is not found. It adds proper error handling and improves the reliability of the devfreq subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to buffer allocation size in the gpio-74x164 driver. This indicates that there was a bug or inefficiency in the previous implementation.

2. The patch correctly identifies that the current allocation size is 8 bytes per register, while only one byte per register is necessary. This suggests that the previous allocation was excessive and could potentially lead to wasted memory.

3. The patch modifies the allocation line to allocate memory based on the number of registers (chip->registers) instead of the number of GPIOs (chip->gpio_chip.ngpio). This change ensures that the buffer is allocated with the correct size.

4. The patch uses the devm_kzalloc() function, which is a managed memory allocation function that automatically frees the memory when the device is removed. This is a good practice for kernel drivers.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a more efficient memory allocation in the gpio-74x164 driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug related to the use of TID (Traffic Identifier) in the iwlagn driver. The current implementation incorrectly uses a max TID count of 9, while it should be 8. The patch corrects this by setting the correct value of 8.

2. The patch author suggests that the use of 9 was an off-by-one confusion, and the correct value should be 8 since only TIDs 0-7 are valid. This reasoning seems logical and aligns with the intended behavior of the driver.

3. The patch also mentions that fixing this bug resolves a specific issue related to Open BA (Block Acknowledgment) session request for a specific MAC address and TID 8. This bug is reported by Nikolay Martynov and triggers a kernel BUG at a specific location in the code.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The handling of bypass_val_on in regulator_get_bypass_regmap is done unconditionally, causing drivers without a defined value for bypass_val_on to report bypass being enabled incorrectly.

2. The patch fixes the issue by adding similar handling in regulator_get_bypass_regmap. It introduces a new variable, val_on, which is assigned the value of rdev->desc->bypass_val_on. If val_on is zero, it is set to rdev->desc->bypass_mask.

3. The *enable variable is then set based on the comparison of (val & rdev->desc->bypass_mask) with val_on.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit (dd1a571daee7).

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author (Charles Keepax) and the maintainer (Mark Brown).

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and is well-documented. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch simplifies the netlink message length assignment in the connector documentation. It replaces the obfuscated calculation of the message length with a precalculated size. Previously, the patch subtracted the netlink header length from the size and then used the NLMSG_LENGTH() macro to add it back again. This approach can be confusing and error-prone.

The new approach directly assigns the precalculated size to the nlmsg_len field of the netlink header. This simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch improves the clarity and maintainability of the code without introducing any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the at91_adc_read_raw() function in the at91_adc.c file.
2. The patch addresses a potential issue where the last converted data register may contain touchscreen relative values if a conversion is requested on another channel while touchscreen mode is enabled.
3. To remove this temporal constraint, the patch suggests taking the conversion value from the channel data register instead of the last converted data register.
4. The patch also adds a new variable "chnb" to the at91_adc_state structure to store the channel number.
5. In the handle_adc_eoc_trigger() function, the patch updates the line that reads the last converted data register to use the channel data register instead.
6. In the at91_adc_rl_interrupt() and at91_adc_9x5_interrupt() functions, the patch updates the condition that checks for the data ready interrupt to use the GENMASK macro with the number of channels.
7. In the at91_adc_read_raw() function, the patch sets the "chnb" variable to the channel number and updates the lines that enable and disable the data ready interrupt to use the BIT macro with the channel number.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue with the last converted data register and improves the handling of conversions on different channels. The changes are localized and do not introduce any significant risks or regressions. Additionally, the patch has received Acked-by tags from multiple contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch addresses an issue in the backref code of the Btrfs filesystem. It explains that the code was incorrectly looking at nodes instead of just leaves when populating extent item entries. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the find_parent_nodes() function in the backref.c file. Specifically, it adds a condition to check if the reference is an extent item and if it has a level of 0 (leaf level). If these conditions are met, it proceeds to read the corresponding tree block.

3. Rationale: The patch fixes the problem by ensuring that only extent items at the leaf level are considered for further processing. This prevents potential crashes that could occur when random memory matches with disk_bytenr. The change appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality or significant code changes.

4. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Josef Bacik and Chris Mason, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on the analysis, the patch seems to address a specific issue and has been reviewed by relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the call to `nfs4_ds_disconnect(clp)` in the `filelayout_async_handle_error` function. The reason for this change is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and a potential Oops.

2. Instead of relying on `nfs4_ds_disconnect`, the patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid any issues related to the device ID.

3. The `nfs4_ds_disconnect` function is also removed from `nfs4filelayout.h` and `nfs4filelayoutdev.c` as it is no longer needed.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or changes to the existing code logic. It only removes a potentially problematic function call.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe change that addresses a potential issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to running the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver.
2. The current behavior of calling dev_close() in the offline self-test causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes interface routes and addresses. This behavior is inconsistent and not what the user intended.
3. The patch suggests calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(), which avoids touching IFF_UP altogether.
4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the ixgbe_open() and ixgbe_close() functions to call the appropriate functions directly.
5. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been tested by another individual.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

   - The bug is reported and confirmed by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki.
   - The patch fixes the issue by checking sc->memcg instead of memcg_kmem_enabled().

2. Fix: The patch correctly checks sc->memcg, which ensures that only memcg-aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs when memcg_kmem_enabled is true.

3. Acknowledgements: The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh.

4. Link: The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML).

2. The patch highlights that SCTP_SNDRCV is a part of the user API (uapi) and is set in stone forever. Therefore, there is no need for a deprecation warning.

3. The patch mentions that SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support to run on older and newer kernels. This indicates that the warning is causing unnecessary complexity for application developers.

4. The patch acknowledges that some users may not have the opportunity to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. The warning would only hinder their experience without providing any real benefit.

5. The patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and has received Acked-by from the same person, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted source.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch and revert the deprecation warning for SCTP_SNDRCV support.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The dma_mmap() function in the IOMMU-based dma-mapping implementation lacks a check for a valid range of mmap parameters (offset and buffer size). This can potentially lead to access beyond the allocated buffer.

2. The patch adds a missing range check: The patch introduces a check to ensure that the offset and buffer size are within the valid range. If the offset is greater than or equal to the number of pages or the buffer size exceeds the available pages, the function returns -ENXIO, indicating an error.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer: The patch is signed-off by Marek Szyprowski and Russell King, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch is marked for stable releases: The patch is marked with "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" and "v3.6+" to indicate that it should be considered for inclusion in stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the size updates for asynchronous I/O (AIO) writes in the NFS (Network File System) code.

2. The patch correctly identifies the problem: In the AIO case, the return value of nfs_direct_wait is turned into -EIOCBQUEUED, causing the size update to be skipped.

3. The patch introduces a new function: nfs_direct_complete, which is called to update the inode size after completing the AIO write operation.

4. The patch includes a hacky implementation: Since there is no obvious way to determine if nfs_direct_complete is called for a write, the patch uses a boolean parameter, "write," to indicate whether it is a write operation or not.

5. The patch ensures the correct size update: If it is a write operation and the current inode size is less than the new position, the patch updates the inode size to the new position.

6. The patch also handles the completion of AIO requests: It calls aio_complete to signal the completion of the AIO request and completes the associated completion queue.

7. The patch is signed-off by two developers: Christoph Hellwig and Trond Myklebust, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the identified issue in the NFS code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses an issue where WRITE_SAME commands are not allowed with the SG_IO ioctl when executed by unprivileged users, resulting in a -EPERM error.

2. Reproduction: The problem can be reproduced using the sg_write_same command, which fails with "Operation not permitted" when executed without CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

3. Comparison: The WRITE_VERIFY command does not encounter this problem because it is already included in the blk_default_cmd_filter write_ok list.

4. Patch solution: The patch adds the WRITE_SAME commands to the write_ok list, allowing the SG_IO ioctl to execute successfully even without CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

5. Use case: The patch is particularly relevant for QEMU KVM guests with 'scsi-block' devices, where the SG_IO ioctl is used by unprivileged users. This scenario can lead to SCSI I/O errors in the guest when performing zero-out calls.

6. Sign-offs and reviews: The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors and reviewed by Christoph Hellwig.

Considering the problem description, the provided reproduction steps, the comparison with WRITE_VERIFY, the patch solution, and the relevant use case, it appears that this patch addresses a valid issue and provides a suitable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. Issue: The patch addresses the incorrect re-injection of STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) packets, which were causing problems with the kernel's STP functionality.

2. Solution: The patch modifies the br_handle_local_finish() function to learn the packet's source MAC address and inject it back into the Rx path for further processing by the packet handlers. This ensures that STP packets appear to originate from their actual source rather than the bridge device itself.

3. Consistency: The patch also ensures consistent behavior for packets destined to the Bridge Group Address, regardless of whether STP is enabled or not. This aligns with netfilter's behavior, where no hook registered at LOCAL_IN will be called for these packets.

4. Fixes: The patch references the commit (8626c56c8279) that introduced the issue and fixes the potential use-after-free problem when the hook returns QUEUE or STOLEN verdict.

5. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, including Jiri Pirko, Ido Schimmel, and David S. Miller.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to address a specific issue, provides a clear solution, and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch includes the necessary fix: The missing register write to restore the UCB1x00 gpio output data is added in the ucb1x00_resume() function.

3. The patch is signed-off by a recognized developer: The patch is signed-off by Russell King, who is a known developer in the Linux kernel community.

4. The patch is focused and does not introduce any unrelated changes: The patch only addresses the specific issue mentioned and does not modify any other unrelated code.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch is necessary to fix a bug and does not introduce any potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, even though the SDM (Software Developer's Manual) states that it is invalid. However, the code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).

2. The patch ensures that the vCPU can get back to real mode to prepare a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER. If the vCPU supports long mode, additional steps are taken.

3. If the vCPU supports long mode, CR4.PCIDE is cleared before CR0.PG. This is necessary because CR4.PCIDE is a 64-bit mode-only feature.

4. A 32-bit code segment is required to clear EFER.LMA. The patch sets up a 32-bit code segment with the necessary attributes.

5. For the 64-bit case, the patch clears EFER.LMA by clearing CR0.PG and CR0.PE.

6. CR4.PAE is cleared before clearing EFER.LME.

7. Finally, the patch sets MSR_EFER to 0 to go back to 32-bit mode.

8. The patch also includes a fix for the opcode table.

Overall, the patch appears to address the necessary steps to allow RSM from 64-bit mode and ensures a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER. It also includes a fix for the opcode table. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and its description, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential lost wakeup scenario in the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl function of the staging driver quatech_usb2. Currently, when the usermode app calls TIOCMIWAIT, the code sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and waits for the qt2_process_modem_status function to wake it up on URB completion.

However, there is a race condition between the qt2_ioctl loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status. This race condition can result in a lost wakeup scenario, where the usermode app's task continues to sleep despite a change in the modem status.

The patch resolves this issue by adding a barrier to ensure memory ordering, setting the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and setting it back to TASK_RUNNING when returning from the loop. This ensures that the task is properly woken up and prevents the lost wakeup scenario.

The patch also includes proper sign-offs and is CC'd to the stable mailing list, indicating that it has been tested and deemed suitable for stable releases.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called get_random_long() to the random.c file in the drivers/char directory. This function is similar to get_random_int() but returns an unsigned long instead of an unsigned int. The purpose of this function is to provide more randomness for generating the random offset to the mmap_base address.

2. The patch also fixes the shifting constant in mmap_rnd() to be an unsigned long. This ensures that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is important for x86 systems as its shift instruction uses a 5-bit mask for the shift operand.

3. The patch replaces calls to get_random_int() with get_random_long() where appropriate. This ensures that the new function is used consistently throughout the codebase.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Kees Cook and signed-off by multiple maintainers and contributors, including Linus Torvalds.

Overall, the patch addresses the need for increased randomness in generating the mmap_base address and fixes a potential issue with shifting on x86 systems. It has received positive reviews and has been signed-off by relevant parties. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to calling xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice on a V4 superblock, which leads to setting both pquotino and gquotino to NULLFSINO. This behavior is not desirable and can cause issues.

2. The patch fixes the issue by making it safe to call xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice and removes the extra calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk.

3. The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the sb_from_disk change occurred after V5 became the default. Therefore, this issue is specific to V4 superblocks.

4. The patch has been reported by Eryu Guan and reviewed by Carlos Maiolino, providing additional validation.

5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Sandeen and Dave Chinner, indicating their agreement with the fix.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue, has been reviewed and validated, and is signed-off by relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch fixes a check in the `irq_domain_add()` function in `irqdomain.c`. The original check was `desc->irq_data != NULL || irq_data->domain != NULL`, which prevented adding an `irq_domain` to an `irq` descriptor when `irq_data` exists. This check is split into two separate checks in the patch.

2. The first check `if (!d)` is added to handle the case when `irq_data` is NULL. If `irq_data` is NULL, it means that the `irq_desc` does not exist, and a warning is printed. This check ensures that a domain is not assigned to a non-existent `irq_desc`.

3. The second check `if (d->domain)` is kept to handle the case when `irq_data->domain` is not NULL. If `irq_data->domain` is not NULL, it means that the `irq_desc` is already assigned to a domain, and a warning is printed.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and relevant individuals who have reviewed the patch.

5. The patch also includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and improves the error handling in the `irq_domain_add()` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch introduces a temporary solution by registering the Exynos DRM device object only for Exynos SoC. This prevents the infinite loop issue from occurring.

3. The patch includes a comment stating that this temporary solution will be replaced with a more generic approach in the future. This indicates that the patch is not a final solution but a step towards resolving the issue.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the infinite loop issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses two audio bugs: 
   a. The first bug is related to changing the audio encoding, which inadvertently changes the input as well. This bug has always been present.
   b. The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and affects the handling of the default_audio_input module option. It prevents the audio encoding from switching to AC3 if default_audio_input is set to 2 (SPDIF input).

2. The first bug now always occurs when the driver is loaded since audio encoding is always set at the start. Previously, it would only surface if the user changed the audio encoding after the driver was loaded.

3. The patch also fixes a small typo in the code.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been reported by a user.

5. The patch is also marked for stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org) for kernel version 3.10 and above.

2. The patch introduces a new variable `tr` of type `struct trace_array` to hold the instance's buffer.

3. The `buffer` variable is updated to use the instance's buffer (`tr->trace_buffer.buffer`) instead of the global trace buffer (`global_trace.trace_buffer.buffer`).

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested by the author and other contributors.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the author and relevant contributors.

6. The patch is also marked for inclusion in the stable release (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 3.10), indicating that it has been deemed suitable for stable releases.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a bug and has been reviewed and tested, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made and their implications:

1. The patch removes the duplicate call to `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` within the functions `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. This is because the call is already being made once during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation. Removing the duplicate call avoids unnecessary overhead.

2. The patch also removes the assignment and increment of `conn->stat_sn` within the same functions. This suggests that the `stat_sn` value should be handled by the `iscsi_target_mode` code instead.

3. The third parameter of `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` is changed to `true` in the `isert_put_datain()` function. This indicates that the `iscsi_target_mode` code should handle the increment of `stat_sn`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to optimize the code by removing duplicate calls and shifting the responsibility of handling `stat_sn` to the `iscsi_target_mode` code. The patch has also been tested and has a Tested-by tag.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is always important to consider the opinions of other experts and maintainers before making a final decision.

4. The patch releases and reacquires the spin lock: To properly release the controller's lock during the gadget resume process, the patch includes spin_unlock(&dwc->lock) before calling the resume function and spin_lock(&dwc->lock) afterward. This ensures that the lock is properly managed and avoids potential deadlocks.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward fix for a known bug and includes necessary checks and lock management. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with devm_kzalloc in the devfreq subsystem. Currently, devm_kzalloc is using the parent device as the dev pointer for allocating memory. However, if the device's devfreq is disabled at runtime, the allocated memory won't be freed, leading to a potential memory leak.

The patch fixes this issue by designating the devfreq device pointer more precisely when using devm_kzalloc. This ensures that the allocated memory will be freed correctly even if the devfreq is disabled.

The changes in the patch involve modifying the devfreq_add_device function. The previous code allocated memory using the parent device pointer, but the patch changes it to use the devfreq device pointer instead. This change is made for both devfreq->trans_table and devfreq->time_in_state allocations.

Overall, the patch seems to address a potential memory leak issue and improves the memory management in the devfreq subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

4. The patch also adds support for eSwitch-enabled adapters by including additional statistics length if the QLCNIC_ESWITCH_ENABLED flag is set.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior of the driver. It only fixes a calculation issue.

6. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. In the file `mmcif-sh7372.c`, line 82:
   - The patch changes the logic of disabling the clock to the MMC hardware block.
   - The original code used a bitwise AND operation (`&`) to disable the clock, but the patch changes it to a bitwise OR operation (`|`).
   - This change seems to correct a logic error in the original implementation.

2. In the file `sdhi-sh7372.c`, line 85:
   - The patch makes a similar change to the previous one but for the SDHI1 hardware block.
   - The original code used a bitwise AND operation (`&`) to disable the clock, but the patch changes it to a bitwise OR operation (`|`).
   - This change also seems to correct a logic error in the original implementation.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch corrects a logic error in the original implementation by changing the bitwise operation from AND (`&`) to OR (`|`) for disabling the clock to the MMC and SDHI1 hardware blocks.

Considering the nature of the changes and the fact that the patch fixes a logic error, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue in the rtnl_calcit() function in the RT netlink code. The function is responsible for calculating the minimal size for a netlink dump message.

2. The problem with the current implementation is that it doesn't account for the size of the header of the netlink message.

3. The patch modifies the return statement of the rtnl_calcit() function to use the nlmsg_total_size() function, which calculates the total size of the netlink message including the header.

4. By using nlmsg_total_size(), the patch ensures that the dump message for every network device can be stored correctly.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue in the RT netlink code and provides a fix that ensures the correct calculation of the minimal dump size for netlink messages.
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes it introduces:

1. The patch adds a check to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports in the `handle_port_status()` function of the xHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) driver.

2. Currently, the PLC is cleared by usbcore for USB3 root hub ports, but not for USB2 ports because they do not report `USB_PORT_STAT_C_LINK_STATE` in `wPortChange`.

3. The patch checks if the speed of the host controller driver (`hcd->speed`) is not equal to `HCD_USB3` (indicating a USB2 root hub port) and then clears the PLC bit using the `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's why:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue where the PLC bit is not cleared for USB2 root hub ports.

2. By clearing the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports, the patch ensures consistent behavior across USB2 and USB3 root hub ports.

3. The change is contained within the xHCI driver and does not impact other parts of the kernel.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

Therefore, considering the nature of the change and the positive impact it has on the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference issue introduced in commit 219580e. This indicates that there is a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.

2. The issue occurs when the function `wait_event_interruptible` is called before `functionfs_bind()`. At this point, `epfile->ffs->gadget` is still NULL, and the `gadget` variable is initialized with NULL.

3. Later on, the `gadget` variable is used as a parameter in the `usb_ep_align_maybe` function, which dereferences it. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

4. The patch fixes the issue by moving the assignment of the `gadget` variable after the waiting has completed. This ensures that `epfile->ffs->gadget` is not NULL when `gadget` is assigned.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Considering all these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: When detecting a non-link packet, the function h5_reset_rx() frees the Rx skb (socket buffer). However, not returning after that can cause the upcoming h5_rx_payload() call to dereference a now NULL Rx skb and trigger a kernel oops.

2. The patch adds a return statement after calling h5_reset_rx(h5), which prevents the subsequent h5_rx_payload() call from being executed when a non-link packet is received in a non-active state.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from Loic Poulain and Marcel Holtmann, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch also includes the appropriate Cc (carbon copy) to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list and specifies the affected file (drivers/bluetooth/hci_h5.c).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made in the patch:

1. The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`.
2. Previously, the condition checked if the hardware reported pointer was smaller than expected and if the time from the last update time (hdelta) was over half a buffer time.
3. The patch addresses a scenario where the hardware reported pointer is only a few bytes smaller than expected and when hdelta is just a little larger than half a buffer time, leading to a wrong treatment of the IRQ as double acknowledged.
4. The patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2` to account for jiffies inaccuracy.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific scenario where the current condition wrongly treats an IRQ as double acknowledged.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a bug where fs_info->pending_changes is never cleared.
   - Explanation: The original code uses cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0), which only clears pending_changes if it is already 0.
   - Impact: This bug causes problems when mounting btrfs with the inode_cache mount option, as pending_changes will always be 1, even when the filesystem is frozen.

2. Solution: The patch replaces cmpxchg with xchg to ensure that fs_info->pending_changes is always cleared.
   - Explanation: The xchg function sets fs_info->pending_changes to 0 unconditionally.
   - Impact: This fix ensures that pending_changes is correctly cleared, resolving the issue described above.

3. Sign-offs: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.
   - Qu Wenruo <quwenruo@cn.fujitsu.com>

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may not match the panel's preferred mode due to incomplete initialization. It replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if the resolutions don't match.

2. Patch implementation:
   The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the `radeon_connectors.c` file. It introduces a loop to iterate through the probed modes of the connector and checks if any mode has the `DRM_MODE_TYPE_PREFERRED` flag set. If a preferred mode is found and its resolution doesn't match the native mode, the native mode is replaced with the preferred mode.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to recalculating the software remain-on-channel (ROC) work timeout in the mac80211 module.

2. The current code unnecessarily recalculates the work timeout for software ROC whenever any item starts, even though it is only necessary when a new item is added to the list.

3. The patch identifies two callers of ieee80211_handle_roc_started() that are for hardware and will skip the recalculation entirely. Therefore, the recalculation is pointless in these cases.

4. The patch also highlights a problematic scenario where if an item on the list expires during the recalculation, the list iteration outside becomes corrupted and crashes.

5. To fix these issues, the patch moves the recalculation to the only place where it is required, which is in the ieee80211_start_roc_work() function.

6. By making this change, the patch ensures that the recalculation is performed only when necessary and avoids potential crashes caused by list corruption.

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a race condition between CLOSE and OPEN calls in NFSv4. If the reply to a successful CLOSE call races with an OPEN call to the same file, it can lead to overwriting the stateid that represents the new open state.

2. Solution: The patch introduces a fix by examining the argument of the CLOSE call and checking for a match with the current stateid "other" field. If the two do not match, it indicates the race condition occurred, and the CLOSE call should be ignored.

3. Patch details: The patch modifies two files: fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h and fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c.

   - In fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h, a new inline function `nfs4_state_match_open_stateid_other` is added to check if the current state matches the open stateid "other" field.
   
   - In fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c, the `nfs_clear_open_stateid_locked` function is modified to ignore the CLOSE call if the argument stateid doesn't match the current stateid. This prevents overwriting the stateid in case of a race condition.

4. Justification: The patch addresses a race condition that can lead to incorrect stateid handling in NFSv4. By checking the argument stateid against the current stateid, the patch ensures that the CLOSE call is only processed if it matches the expected state, preventing any potential corruption.

5. Acknowledgment: The patch has been reported by Benjamin Coddington and signed-off by Trond Myklebust and Anna Schumaker.

Based on the analysis, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it resolves a race condition and improves the stability of NFSv4 in the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the qeth (QDIO Ethernet) driver in the Linux kernel.
2. The problem is that changes to the blkt (block size) default values are reset during online setting due to a second invocation of the qeth_determine_capabilities() function.
3. The patch ensures that blkt default values are configured only during the first run of qeth_determine_capabilities(), thus preserving blkt changes during online setting.
4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and the reported-by tag from the person who reported the issue.
5. The code change is made in the qeth_core_main.c file, specifically in the qeth_determine_capabilities() function.
6. The change checks if the device is offline before configuring the blkt default values, ensuring that the configuration is only done during the initial setup.
7. The patch also frees allocated memory and performs other necessary operations before returning.
8. The change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior, but rather fixes a specific issue related to blkt default values.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported issue and does not introduce any potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: false-positive warnings in dev_pm_domain_set() when attempting to clear the pm_domain pointer after invoking the driver's ->remove() callback.

2. The patch proposes a fix by modifying the dev_pm_domain_set() function to check if the pointer passed to it is NULL and skip the warning in that case.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which indicates that it resolves a specific commit (989561de9b51) that introduced the issue.

4. The patch has been tested by multiple individuals, as indicated by the "Tested-by" tags, which adds confidence in its effectiveness.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch is described as a hardening fix, which suggests that it addresses a security vulnerability or improves the overall security of the system. Hardening fixes are generally important for stable releases.

2. The patch adds a check to prevent processes with write-only access to a terminal from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. This is done by checking if the file mode includes read access (FMODE_READ) before allowing the process to set the terminal as the controlling terminal.

3. The patch also adds a similar check in the tiocsctty() function, which is called when setting the controlling terminal. It checks if the file mode does not include read access and the process does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, in which case it returns an error (-EPERM).

4. The comments in the patch explain the rationale behind these checks, mentioning that many distributions set the group of all ttys to "tty" and grant write-only access to all terminals for setgid tty binaries. This should not imply full privileges on all ttys, so the patch ensures that only processes with read access can obtain the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and is also marked for stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), indicating that it has been reviewed and tested for stability.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid hardening fix that improves the security of the system. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue introduced by commit c702418f8a2f, which removed zone watermark checks from the compaction code in kswapd but left in the zone congestion clearing unconditionally on higher order reclaim.

2. The issue with the current code is that it messes up the reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages. The congestion status of zones should only be cleared when their watermarks have been restored.

3. The proposed solution is to remove the clearing of congestion from the zone compaction section entirely. The preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd will clear it if the zone is considered balanced.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Johannes Weiner and Rik van Riel, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

5. The patch is also signed-off by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, further validating its credibility.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the usage of the IS_ERR() macro and PTR_ERR() function for error handling in the smd_pkt_init() function in drivers/char/msm_smd_pkt.c.

2. Instead of checking if the return value of kzalloc() is an error pointer using IS_ERR(), the patch changes the condition to check if the return value is NULL.

3. The patch also removes the printing of the error code using PTR_ERR() and replaces it with a generic error message.

4. The change simplifies the error handling logic by directly checking for NULL return values, which is the expected behavior for basic memory allocation functions.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only improves the error handling code.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to the code and does not introduce any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch fixes an issue related to tiled monitor configurations in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem of the Intel i915 graphics driver.

2. The patch introduces a new variable `conn_seq` to keep track of the configured connectors.

3. The patch modifies the loop that iterates over the connectors to check if they are already configured. If a connector is already configured, it is skipped.

4. The patch also checks if the connector has tile support. If it doesn't, the connector is skipped.

5. The patch updates the `conn_configured` bitmask to mark the configured connectors.

6. The patch adds a check to see if all connectors have been configured. If not, it retries the configuration.

7. Finally, if the BIOS did not enable all possible connectors, the patch falls back to having the BIOS enable them.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to tiled monitor configurations and improves the configuration process. It does not introduce any new functionality or significant changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a known issue and improves the stability of the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to IRQ allocation for PCI devices when there are conflicting IRQs occupied by ISA devices. This issue can cause interrupt storms due to incompatible pin attributes.

2. The issue was triggered on a KVM virtual machine that uses IRQ9 for SCI in high-level mode and defines a PCI interrupt link device (LNKS) with IRQ9 as the only possible IRQ. This setup causes an interrupt storm when enabling the PCI device because PCI IRQ works in low-level mode.

3. The patch modifies the acpi_isa_register_gsi() function in drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c to avoid allocating IRQs occupied by ISA IRQs for PCI link devices. It checks if the IRQ is available and within the allowed range before allocating it.

4. The patch also modifies the acpi_pci_link_allocate() function in drivers/acpi/pci_link.c to handle the case where no IRQ is available for the PCI link device. It prints an error message and returns -ENODEV if the IRQ penalty for the selected IRQ is higher than or equal to PIRQ_PENALTY_ISA_ALWAYS.

5. The patch introduces a new function, acpi_isa_irq_available(), in include/linux/acpi.h to check if an IRQ is available for ISA devices. This function returns true if the IRQ is within the allowed range and the IRQ penalty is lower than PIRQ_PENALTY_ISA_ALWAYS.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to IRQ allocation for PCI devices and provides a solution to avoid interrupt storms caused by incompatible pin attributes. It introduces necessary checks and error handling to ensure proper IRQ allocation. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made and the reasoning provided:

1. The patch fixes the calculation of transmitted bytes on tx complete in the c_can driver for CAN (Controller Area Network) messages.
2. Previously, if multiple CAN messages with different lengths were transmitted together, the number of transmitted bytes was not updated correctly.
3. This resulted in incorrect transmit byte counts being displayed by programs like 'ifconfig'.
4. The reason for the issue was that the message object whose Data Length Code (DLC) is to be read was not necessarily the active one at the time of execution.
5. The patch adds a call to the function `c_can_object_get()` to ensure that the correct message object is active before reading the DLC.
6. After applying the patch, the transmitted bytes are correctly updated in the `stats->tx_bytes` variable.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a bug that leads to incorrect transmit byte counts and ensures that the correct message object is used for DLC calculation.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the CPU hotplug code for the powernv platform.
2. Currently, offline CPUs are only put into nap mode if the powersave_nap variable is set. However, HV-style KVM on this platform requires secondary CPU threads to be offline and in nap mode.
3. The patch modifies the code to always put offline CPUs into nap mode, regardless of powersave_nap. This change is justified because nap mode works fine on all POWER7 machines, which are the only machines that support the powernv platform.
4. The powersave_nap variable still controls whether or not CPUs go into nap mode when idle, as before.
5. The patch has been signed-off by two developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
6. The changes are made in three different files: arch/powerpc/include/asm/processor.h, arch/powerpc/kernel/idle_power7.S, and arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/smp.c. These changes are specific to the powerpc/powernv platform.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the powernv platform. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

Considering the above points, it seems reasonable to accept this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a situation where association restarts do not consider the state of the socket. This can lead to a condition where a remote system creates a local association that is not reachable by the user.

2. Solution: The patch modifies the behavior by moving the newly established association into the SHUTDOWN-SENT state and bundling a SHUTDOWN after the COOKIE-ACK chunk. This ensures that the restarted association immediately enters the shutdown procedure and terminates the unreachable association.

3. Reported-by and Signed-off-by: The patch includes the information of the person who reported the issue and the individuals who have signed off on the patch, indicating their approval.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the `SCTP_MAX_NUM_COMMANDS` macro in `include/net/sctp/command.h` to increase the maximum number of commands from 14 to 20. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any obvious issues.

5. Code modifications: The patch modifies the `sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a` function in `net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c`. It adds a condition to check if the association is in the SHUTDOWN_PENDING state and if the socket has been closed by the user. If so, it triggers a SHUTDOWN bundled with COOKIE_ACK instead of transitioning to the ESTABLISHED state. Otherwise, it proceeds with the normal transition to the ESTABLISHED state.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a solution that seems reasonable. It also includes the necessary information and has been reviewed by relevant individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the checking of the return value of `blk_mq_init_queue` function in three different drivers: `null_blk.c`, `nvme-core.c`, and `virtio_blk.c`.

2. The current code checks if `nullb->q`, `dev->admin_q`, and `q` are NULL to determine if `blk_mq_init_queue` failed. However, the patch changes this check to use `IS_ERR` macro instead, which is a more appropriate way to handle error conditions.

3. The patch also includes a comment stating that NULL is never returned by `blk_mq_init_queue`, so the check for NULL is unnecessary.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Ming Lei, Jens Axboe, and the author of the respective drivers.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for correctly handling the return value of `blk_mq_init_queue` and has been reviewed by relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It locks the i_mmap_mutex for accessing the VMA prio list to prevent concurrent access. This ensures proper synchronization and avoids potential race conditions.

5. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Stanislaw Gruszka <sgruszka@redhat.com> and John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>, which adds credibility to its validity.

6. Code changes: The patch modifies the brcms_c_wait_for_tx_completion() function by adding a timeout mechanism to break the loop after a certain number of iterations.

7. Analysis: The patch introduces a timeout mechanism to prevent the infinite loop, which helps avoid system lockup. The addition of the WARN_ON_ONCE statement ensures that if the timeout is reached, a warning message will be displayed.

Considering the severity of the issue and the provided workaround, it is reasonable to include this patch in the Linux -stable releases to prevent system lockup. However, it is important to note that a proper fix for the root cause should be pursued in the future.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: Commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, which assumed that the interrupt trigger was already properly configured. However, this assumption may not be safe, as some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot.

2. To fix this issue, the patch forces the IRQ to trigger on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. This ensures that the IRQ trigger is properly configured, even on boards where all interrupt triggers are disabled.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to set the IRQ trigger type to IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING if it is not already set. This ensures that the IRQ trigger is correctly configured before requesting the IRQ.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a solution that ensures the IRQ trigger is properly configured. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() function called from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() may cause global P-state limits to change, which is confusing and unnecessary.

2. The patch explains that in passive mode, the global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor and are not taken into account by governors when making decisions. Therefore, making the global limits follow the per-policy limits serves no purpose and may go against user expectations.

3. The patch removes the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(), reducing the code size by a few lines.

4. The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. It removes the only piece of code updating the per-CPU limits in that mode, ensuring that the per-policy settings are the only ones taken into account, as expected.

5. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.

6. The patch is signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue with enum control accesses in the wm8994 codec driver. The DRC Mode and EQ Mode are enum controls, but the current driver incorrectly accesses them using value.integer.value[]. The patch corrects this by using value.enumerated.item[] instead.

2. The patch is signed-off by both Takashi Iwai and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The patch includes the appropriate Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org and sound/soc/codecs/wm8994.c mailing lists, ensuring that it is properly tracked and reviewed by the relevant maintainers.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to specific functions (wm8994_put_drc_enum and wm8994_put_retune_mobile_enum) within the wm8994.c file, minimizing the risk of introducing unintended side effects.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant maintainers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the logic in the netxen_nic_poll() function.
2. The NAPI poll logic now enforces that a poller returns exactly the budget when it wants to be called again.
3. If a driver limits TX completion, it should return the budget when the limit is hit, not the number of received packets.
4. The patch has been reported and tested by Mike Galbraith and signed-off by Eric Dumazet.
5. It also fixes an issue introduced by the commit "d75b1ade567f" in the net module.
6. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Manish Chopra.
7. Finally, it has been signed-off by David S. Miller.

Considering the above points, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue, has been tested, reviewed, and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in the IB/mlx4 driver. It aims to prevent misbehavior and corruption of the join/leave database caused by clients re-registering events.

2. Currently, the cleanup of MCGs is performed in a work queue, which can lead to a race condition. If a ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) leaves and re-joins groups before the cleanup occurs, the cleanup process may prune the newly joined MCGs, leaving the ULP without the actual MCGs while believing it has joined them.

3. The patch fixes this issue by setting a flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clearing it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup process is synchronized and prevents the race condition described above.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the _mlx4_ib_mcg_port_cleanup() and mlx4_ib_mcg_port_cleanup() functions to implement the flushing flag mechanism.

5. The patch is signed-off by Eli Cohen and reviewed by Jack Morgenstein, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the race condition in the MCG cleanup process. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch includes "Tested-by" tags from two individuals, Eric Griffith and Kent Baxley, indicating that they have tested the patch and found it to be effective.

4. Code Changes:
The patch introduces a new quirk, QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE, which is set for Dell XPS 13 models. It also adds a new function, quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable(), which applies the quirk by setting the QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE flag in the dev_priv->quirks variable.

5. Quirk Usage:
The quirk is then used in the intel_panel_enable_backlight() function to conditionally enable BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE based on the presence of the QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE flag. This ensures that the backlight controls work correctly on affected Dell XPS 13 models.

6. Intel Quirks:
The patch adds Dell XPS 13 models to the list of devices with quirks in the intel_quirks[] array. This ensures that the quirk is applied specifically to these models.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be well-documented, tested, and addresses a known issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the need for the shark_led_work function to take the v4l2 lock. This change simplifies the code and eliminates the need for locking and unlocking the mutex in shark_led_work.

2. The shark_led_work function is modified to remove the mutex lock and unlock operations. This change is possible because the video_is_registered check is removed from the function.

3. In the usb_shark_disconnect function, the cancel_work_sync function is called to cancel any pending work in shark->led_work. This ensures that the work is properly canceled before the device is disconnected.

4. The usb_shark_release function no longer calls cancel_work_sync for shark->led_work since it is already called in usb_shark_disconnect. This change avoids redundant cancellation of work.

5. In the radio-shark2.c file, similar changes are made to the shark_led_work function and the usb_shark_disconnect function.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary locking and unlocking operations and ensures proper cancellation of work before device disconnection. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. Issue Description:
   The patch addresses a race condition in the dm cache module that can cause dirty blocks to be incorrectly marked as clean. This can lead to writeback not occurring or the policy incorrectly assuming that the block is clean.

2. Proposed Fix:
   The patch proposes a fix by reordering the sequence of operations. It suggests calling clear_dirty() before cell_defer() to ensure that incoming bios for the block are detained in the cell and released only after clear_dirty() has completed.

true || Based on the provided information, I will analyze the patch to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to fix an issue where using certain commands in konsole, such as emacs or cat, with recent kernels can cause konsole to freeze when pressing CTRL-C. The issue is similar to a bug reported in Solaris, but it is now observed in Linux as well.

The patch modifies the pty_flush_buffer function in drivers/tty/pty.c. It removes the code that flushes the ldisc (line discipline) buffer and instead directly flushes the write buffer of the receiving side. The reasoning behind this change is that the data in the ldisc belongs to the application on the other side, and clearing it when flushing the write buffer of this side is unnecessary.

The patch includes the Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the problematic behavior, and it is also marked for stable releases starting from version 4.0.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue reported by users and provides a targeted fix without introducing any known regressions. Additionally, the patch includes proper documentation and references to the relevant bug report and commit.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch aims to disallow a read-write remount on a filesystem with unknown ro-compat features.
   - It addresses the issue where a kernel that refuses to mount a filesystem read-write due to unknown ro-compat features can still transition to read-write via the remount path.
   - Writing to the filesystem in this scenario may corrupt metadata related to the new feature, causing problems when moving to a newer kernel that understands the feature.

2. Justification for inclusion:
   - The patch ensures that if anyone is using newer mkfs (which enables the finobt feature) with older kernel releases, they will be protected.
   - It prevents potential metadata corruption and compatibility issues when transitioning to a newer kernel that understands the feature.

3. Code analysis:
   - The patch adds a check in the xfs_fs_remount function in xfs_super.c.
   - If the filesystem has an unknown ro-compat feature and the remount is attempted from read-only to read-write, an error is returned (-EINVAL).
   - The patch also logs a warning message indicating the prohibition of the ro->rw transition on an unknown ro-compat filesystem.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary fix to prevent potential issues with metadata corruption and compatibility. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my decision:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current implementation of fib_netdev_event in the Linux kernel mistakenly removes local routes when the NETDEV_DOWN event is triggered, even if the local address is still present. This patch fixes this behavior by introducing the 'force' variable and using it to determine whether the local routes should be deleted or not.

2. The patch includes a clear explanation of the problem and the solution, making it easier for other developers to understand and review.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the issue, providing additional context and traceability.

4. The patch has been signed-off by the original author and the maintainer, indicating that it has gone through the necessary review process.

5. The changes in the patch are localized to specific functions and files, minimizing the risk of introducing unintended side effects.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-structured, addresses a specific issue, and has undergone the necessary review process. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to support only IPv4 TCP/UDP checksum offload for the smsc95xx driver. This means that when TX checksum offload is used, the LAN95xx device will not alter the checksum to 0xffff if the computed checksum is 0. This behavior is specific to IPv4 packets.

2. The patch includes a comment explaining the rationale behind disabling checksum offload for IPv6 packets. According to RFC 2460, when calculating the UDP checksum for IPv6 packets, a result of zero must be changed to 0xffff. Therefore, checksum offload is disabled for IPv6 packets.

3. The patch modifies the `smsc95xx_set_features` function to enable checksum offload only for IPv4 packets (`features & NETIF_F_IP_CSUM`). This ensures that checksum offload is only enabled for the appropriate packet types.

4. The `smsc95xx_bind` function is also modified to set the hardware features of the network device. The `NETIF_F_IP_CSUM` flag is added to enable checksum offload for IPv4 packets, while `NETIF_F_RXCSUM` is used to enable receive checksum offload.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change existing behavior. It simply restricts checksum offload to IPv4 packets, which aligns with the intended behavior of the LAN95xx device.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and targeted fix for the smsc95xx driver. It ensures that checksum offload is handled correctly for IPv4 packets while disabling it for IPv6 packets, as per the relevant RFCs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The MC (Memory Controller) is not hung but busy, so there is no need to perform an MC reset. This is a more efficient approach as MC reset is tricky and not reliable.

2. The patch includes changes in multiple files (evergreen.c, ni.c, r600.c, and si.c) within the drivers/gpu/drm/radeon directory. This indicates that the fix is applicable to different GPU architectures.

3. The reported issue is a hang in certain cases, and the patch claims to fix it. The reported-by field indicates that the issue was identified by Josh Boyer and signed-off by Alex Deucher, who is an AMD employee and a maintainer of the Radeon DRM driver.

4. The patch modifies the respective GPU check_soft_reset functions in each file to skip the MC reset if the reset_mask indicates that the MC is busy. This change is accompanied by a debug message to indicate the MC's busy status.

Overall, the patch seems to provide a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

2. Solution: The patch forces the AHB1 clock to use PLL6 as its parent. This ensures that the DMA engine and hstimer work correctly.

3. Justification: The previous method of setting the AHB1 clock parent in the device tree is no longer applicable due to the use of a monolithic driver. The clocks critical to the system are not exported through the device tree. Therefore, it is necessary to force this setting in the driver before the clocks are registered.

4. Reported-by: The issue has been reported by Hans de Goede and Maxime Ripard, indicating that it is a known problem.

5. Fixes: The patch references a commit that introduced the A31/A31s clocks, indicating that it is addressing a specific issue related to those clocks.

6. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Chen-Yu Tsai and Maxime Ripard, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

7. Code changes: The patch modifies the sun6i-a31.c file to add the necessary code for forcing the AHB1 clock to use PLL6 as its parent.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The extent buffer bitmap test fails on big-endian systems such as ppc64 due to incorrect bit comparison.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It states that the issue arises because extent_buffer_test_bit() reads in byte granularity while test_bit() reads in unsigned long granularity. The patch fixes the problem by reading the bitmap in byte granularity.

3. The patch includes proper review and sign-off by relevant developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by experts in the field.

4. The changes in the patch are localized to the fs/btrfs/tests/extent-io-tests.c file, which suggests that it is specific to the Btrfs filesystem self-tests.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition in the firmware loader. Multiple loading requests can be pending on the same firmware buffer, and this patch ensures that all requests see the mapped 'buf->data' once the loading is completed.

2. The patch introduces a new function called `fw_map_pages_buf()` that is responsible for mapping the pages buffer. It checks if `buf->data` is already mapped and unmaps it before mapping the pages using `vmap()`. If the mapping is successful, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns -ENOMEM.

3. In the `firmware_loading_store()` function, after completing the loading of firmware, the patch calls `fw_map_pages_buf()` to ensure that all pending requests can see the mapped 'buf->data'. This ensures that the requests can access the firmware data once the loading is completed.

4. The patch also removes the previous call to `fw_map_pages_buf()` in the `_request_firmware_load()` function. This is because the mapping is now done after completing the loading in `firmware_loading_store()`.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the dmi_scan function in the firmware/dmi_scan.c file. The problem is that the "End of Table" entry, which should be created as type 127, is not being handled properly after adding initial SMBIOS v3 support. This results in the entry not being created in the dmi sysfs.

The patch resolves this issue by moving the end-of-table check after it is handled by the dmi_table function. This ensures that the "End of Table" entry is properly created in the dmi sysfs.

The patch has been reviewed by Ard Biesheuvel and signed-off by Ivan Khoronzhuk and Matt Fleming. It also includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for stable releases.

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch aims to relax the MTU constraints for vxlan devices without an underlying device.
   - It allows setting the MTU of such devices to larger values, up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead.
   - The previous limitation of a maximum MTU of 1500, which is arbitrary in the context of vxlan, is removed.

2. Impact of the patch:
   - The patch enables vxlan devices to take advantage of jumbo frames and other larger MTU sizes.
   - The default MTU remains 1500 for compatibility.

3. Patch details:
   - The patch modifies the `vxlan_change_mtu` function in the `vxlan.c` file.
   - It introduces the `__vxlan_change_mtu` function, which handles the actual MTU change logic.
   - The `__vxlan_change_mtu` function calculates the maximum MTU based on the lower device's MTU and adjusts it for vxlan overhead.
   - If the new MTU is within the valid range, it updates the device's MTU accordingly.
   - If the new MTU exceeds the maximum allowed, it either returns an error or adjusts the new MTU to the maximum, depending on the `strict` flag.

4. Overall assessment:
   - The patch addresses a limitation in vxlan devices by allowing larger MTU sizes.
   - It provides flexibility for network configurations that can benefit from jumbo frames and larger MTUs.
   - The patch does not introduce any significant risks or regressions.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the default value of "ret" in the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function. This issue can cause a driver to return -EOPNOTSUPP during the commit phase of a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev.

2. The issue was reported by Andrew Lunn and has been acknowledged by him as well.

3. The patch modifies the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function to properly handle the STP state update. It introduces a new variable "p" to store the dsa_slave_priv structure and "ds" to store the dsa_switch structure. It also modifies the logic to check if the switchdev transaction is in the prepare phase and returns 0 if the driver supports port_stp_update, or -EOPNOTSUPP if it doesn't. Otherwise, it calls the driver's port_stp_update function.

4. The patch is signed-off by Vivien Didelot and David S. Miller, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.

Considering the reported issue and the provided fix, the patch appears to be a valid solution. It addresses a specific problem and has been reviewed and acknowledged by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through the changes made and the rationale provided:

1. The patch aims to fix a potential issue where the hardware (HW) could try to access host buffers that have been freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the firmware (FW). This could lead to a host crash.

2. The patch adds a call to "bnxt_qplib_free_mrw" to deregister the MR in the firmware before freeing the fast_reg_page_list.

3. If there are non-zero "npages" and "pages" in the MR, the patch calls "bnxt_qplib_free_fast_reg_page_list" to free the fast_reg_page_list and then frees the "pages" using "kfree".

4. The patch also releases the "ib_umem" if it is not NULL.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue by ensuring that the MR is deregistered in the firmware before freeing the associated resources. The changes appear to be logically correct and aim to prevent a host crash.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to traversing the EEH devices list safely. The current implementation using `list_for_each_entry()` is not safe enough because the EEH devices might be removed from its parent PE while iterating. The patch replaces it with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe list traversal.

2. The patch includes changes in multiple files: `arch/powerpc/include/asm/eeh.h`, `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c`, and `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_pe.c`. These changes are necessary to implement the safe list traversal in the EEH subsystem.

3. The patch introduces a new macro `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` that uses `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to iterate over the EEH devices in a given PE. This macro is used in multiple places within the EEH subsystem to ensure safe iteration.

4. The changes in `eeh_slot_error_detail()` function and `__eeh_pe_state_mark()` function correctly use the new macro `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` to iterate over the EEH devices in a PE. This ensures that the list traversal is safe and avoids potential issues when devices are removed during iteration.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a safer way to traverse the EEH devices list. It introduces necessary changes in multiple files and uses a new macro to ensure safe iteration. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a comment explaining the scenario where an RPC client's dentries may not be held by anyone except the notification callback, and when the client is released, its dentries need to be destroyed, requiring the per-net PipeFS superblock to be set.

2. The patch sets the per-net PipeFS superblock (sn->pipefs_sb) before sending the MOUNT notification for the RPC client.

3. If the MOUNT notification fails (err != 0), the patch jumps to the "err_depopulate" label, which calls the RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification and performs cleanup operations.

4. After the cleanup, the patch sets sn->pipefs_sb to NULL.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses a specific scenario where the per-net PipeFS superblock needs to be set before sending the MOUNT notification for an RPC client.

1. The patch addresses an issue where Rx data sometimes drops during non-DMA transfer mode.

2. The cause of the issue is identified as the read complete condition not being true.

3. The patch modifies the code in the pch_spi_handler_sub function.

4. The if condition is changed to check if tx_index is equal to bpw_len and if rx_index is equal to tx_index.

5. If the condition is true, interrupts are disabled, and the transfer is considered complete. The pch_spi_process_messages function is informed, and the necessary flags are updated.

6. If the condition is false, an error message is logged, but no other action is taken.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to dropped Rx data and fixes the read complete condition. The changes appear to be focused and do not introduce any new potential issues.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning reported by Linus Torvalds, indicating a potential undefined behavior in the code.
2. The warning is caused by a loop that iterates from 0 to 3, but the array `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` only has two members.
3. Although the bug seems benign because the overwritten values are not used, it is still a valid issue that needs to be fixed.
4. Linus Torvalds has pulled the patch and mentioned that it doesn't seem to affect the build or functionality, but requests for it to be fixed.
5. The proposed fix changes the size of the array `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct approach.
6. The patch includes the necessary changes to fix the issue.

Therefore, considering the importance of maintaining code correctness and addressing potential issues, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a fix for preventing screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers from Intel.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific issue and has been reviewed and tested by the relevant developers, indicating its reliability and effectiveness. Additionally, the references provided further support the need for this patch.

However, it is important to note that a thorough analysis of the patch code and its impact on the overall system would be necessary before finalizing the decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to stack overflow with CONFIG_KASAN and gcc-5. The use of ACCESS_ONCE() is causing a detrimental effect on builds with gcc-5 and CONFIG_KASAN=y, leading to kernel stack overflow errors.

The patch removes the use of ACCESS_ONCE() and directly uses the base address for read and write operations. The author has verified that the object code generated by gcc-5.3.1 is better without ACCESS_ONCE() and practically identical to the object code generated by gcc-7.0.0.

Considering that the patch fixes a specific issue and has been tested with different versions of gcc, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up in the MediaTek Ethernet driver. The patch adds a loop to stop all devices and properly shut down the DMA before removing the module.

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses a specific issue and ensures that the DMA resources are freed and the state is restored correctly during driver removal.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to replace the usage of `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `truncate_pagecache()` in the `ext4_collapse_range()` function in `fs/ext4/extents.c`.

2. The reason for this change is explained in the patch description. The patch states that `truncate_pagecache()` should be used instead of `truncate_pagecache_range()` because the intention is to truncate the page cache from the specified offset to the end of the file. Additionally, `truncate_pagecache()` also removes private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range, which is necessary since the end of the file is being shifted.

3. The patch is signed-off by Lukas Czerner and Theodore Ts'o, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code change itself replaces the call to `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `truncate_pagecache(inode, offset)`, which aligns with the intention described in the patch.

5. The patch also includes a comment indicating that it waits for existing direct I/O (dio) operations to complete before proceeding.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the `ext4_collapse_range()` function in the ext4 filesystem. It addresses a specific issue and provides a more appropriate function call for truncating the page cache. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue where the s3c_hsotg_phy_disable function is called multiple times during driver removal, leading to a decrease in the phy reference counter below zero. This can cause consecutive module inserts to fail.

2. The patch removes the calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from both s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions.

3. The s3c_hsotg_udc_stop function is called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Therefore, there is no need to disable the phy again in s3c_hsotg_udc_stop.

4. The s3c_hsotg_remove function should only be called after udc_stop, so there is no point in disabling the phy once again there.

5. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Samsung, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by them.

6. The patch is also marked for stable releases, indicating that it is a fix for a stable kernel version (3.16).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM. This is necessary to allow dynamic reconfiguration of trapping on a per-vCPU basis.

2. The patch mimics what KVM/arm64 already does, which is to have a per-vCPU HCR field initialized at setup time. This ensures consistency across different architectures.

3. The patch modifies the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_arm.h file by removing the HCR_VIRT_EXCP_MASK definition. This is no longer needed since the HCR is now per-vCPU.

4. The patch adds the HYP trapping configuration field (hcr) to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch in the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_host.h file. This field will hold the per-vCPU HCR value.

5. The patch also adds the irq_lines field to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch. This field will store the IRQ and FIQ levels.

6. The patch updates the arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.c file to include the offset of the new VCPU_HCR field.

7. The patch initializes the vcpu->arch.hcr field with the HCR_GUEST_MASK value in the kvm_arch_vcpu_setup function in the arch/arm/kvm/guest.c file. This ensures that the per-vCPU HCR is properly initialized.

8. The patch modifies the configure_hyp_role macro in the arch/arm/kvm/interrupts_head.S file to use the per-vCPU HCR value instead of the HCR_GUEST_MASK and VCPU_IRQ_LINES values.

Overall, the patch introduces necessary changes to support per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register in KVM/ARM. It follows the existing implementation in KVM/arm64 and ensures consistency across architectures. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The removal of the "is_task_frozen_enough" function in a previous commit caused freezing groups with stopped tasks to remain in the CGROUP_FREEZING state and never reach the CGROUP_FROZEN state.

2. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it at the original locations where freezing is checked (update_if_frozen and try_to_freeze_cgroup). This ensures that both frozen tasks and stopped tasks are considered as "frozen enough" for the freezing process.

3. The patch includes a testcase that verifies the fix by creating a freezer cgroup, stopping a task within it, and checking if the freezer state transitions to "FROZEN" correctly.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by multiple individuals, including Li Zefan, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue with the DMA debug API and how it handles multiple mappings of the same buffer. This indicates that it is fixing a bug or improving the functionality of the API.

2. The patch modifies the search algorithm in the debug_dma_mapping_error function to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address. This ensures that the map_err_type field is correctly set even when multiple addresses exist.

3. The patch also mentions a secondary side effect where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type in the case of multiple buffers using the same address. However, it suggests that this behavior may be preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Shuah Khan and Joerg Roedel, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.

5. The patch has been signed-off by several developers, including Alexander Duyck, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds, indicating their approval and agreement with the changes.

true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

The patch modifies the `pl031_remove` function in the `rtc-pl031.c` file. It replaces the argument `ldata->rtc` with `ldata` in the `free_irq` function call.

The patch addresses an issue where the wrong pointer was being passed to the `free_irq` function. The `free_irq` function expects the same pointer that was passed to the `request_irq` function in order to properly free the IRQ.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes an incorrect configuration in the Pre-Scalar of FLL for the nau8825 codec, ensuring that the clk_ref_div value is assigned correctly.
true || Based on the provided patch and analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. The patch aims to fix the last shadow judgment in the `memory_is_poisoned_16()` function in `mm/kasan/kasan.c`.

2. The patch addresses the issue where the shadow corresponding to 16 bytes of memory may span 2 or 3 bytes. If the memory is aligned on 8 bytes, the shadow only takes 2 bytes. Therefore, it checks if `shadow_first_bytes` is enough and avoids calling `memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15)` unnecessarily.

3. The patch identifies a wrong judgment in the code where `if (likely(!last_byte))` is used. It provides an example where `addr=0` and `last_byte = 15 & KASAN_SHADOW_MASK = 7`, causing the code to call `memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15)` incorrectly.

4. The patch modifies the code to use `if (likely(IS_ALIGNED(addr, 8)))` instead of the incorrect judgment, ensuring that the function returns the correct result.

5. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Andrey Ryabinin <aryabinin@virtuozzo.com>.

1. The patch addresses an issue where the driver does not generate an alarm interrupt even though a time for an alarm is set. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch ensures that the driver maintains its enabled state for rtc_clk until the alarm interrupt occurs. This is achieved by introducing the function `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable` which enables or disables the rtc_clk based on the `enable` parameter.

3. The patch also makes the `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_lock` variable local to the `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable` function, which improves code encapsulation and reduces potential conflicts with other parts of the codebase.

4. The patch modifies the `s3c_rtc_alarmirq` function to call `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable(false)` before returning from the interrupt handler. This ensures that the rtc_clk is disabled when the alarm interrupt occurs.

5. The patch modifies the `s3c_rtc_setaie` function to call `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable(enabled)` before returning. This ensures that the rtc_clk is enabled or disabled based on the `enabled` parameter.

5. The patch has been reported by Maria Guseva and signed-off by Andrey Ryabinin, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

6. The patch is also CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, suggesting that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these points, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a deadlock issue between rmmod and set_mode in the IB/ipoib driver. The deadlock occurs due to a conflicting order of locking between sys/fs and rtnl_lock.

The patch modifies the set_mode function to check if ipoib_set_mode returned -EBUSY, indicating that the rtnl_lock is still held. If so, it does not unlock rtnl_lock. Additionally, the patch modifies ipoib_set_mode to use rtnl_trylock instead of rtnl_lock, returning -EBUSY if the lock acquisition fails.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, further analysis and testing are necessary to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or side effects. It is recommended to involve the relevant maintainers and submit the patch for review and testing before including it in the stable release.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference crash in memset on POWER7 while trying to allocate an HPT in the case where no HPTs were preallocated.
   - Explanation: The current implementation of kvm_alloc_linear in the Linux kernel is using and dereferencing ri after the list_for_each_entry loop has reached the end of the list. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference crash if the free_linears list is empty.
   - Solution: The patch fixes this issue by using a separate variable (ret) for the return value from the loop iterator and assigning it to ri before breaking out of the loop. This ensures that ri is properly defined and avoids the NULL pointer dereference crash.

2. Code Improvement: The patch also improves the code by moving the memset call before returning the allocated linear info.
   - Explanation: The memset call is moved before returning the allocated linear info (ret) to ensure that the memory is properly initialized.
   - Benefit: This change ensures that the allocated memory is correctly zeroed out before being used, improving the reliability and stability of the code.

3. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Paul Mackerras and Alexander Graf, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on the analysis above, the patch appears to address a specific issue and improves the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Description of the issue:
   The bnx2x driver uses an incorrect PF identifier to configure the interrupt scheme for VF (Virtual Function) in hardware. This results in incorrect configuration for PFs with a high index (4+), causing a single ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) scheme to be configured for its VFs. Consequently, if a VF uses multiple queues, interrupt generation will stop after receiving an Rx packet or sending a Tx packet on a queue other than queue[0].

2. Patch solution:
   The patch fixes the issue by correctly calculating the PF identifier for configuring the VF interrupt scheme. It uses the BP_ABS_FUNC(bp) value, which is shifted and masked to obtain the correct PF identifier. The patch also includes a debug print statement to display the value in IGU_REG_VF_CONFIGURATION after the write operation.

3. Sign-offs:
   The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, including Yuval Mintz, Ariel Elior, and David S. Miller.

3. The "ctrl" variable is initialized with the values of "first_eor" (End of Ring), "first_len" (Length), and the control flags "FirstFrag" and "DescOwn".

4. If the "mss" (Maximum Segment Size) is non-zero, the "LargeSend" flag is set in the "ctrl" variable, along with the "mss" value shifted by "MSSShift" bits.

5. If the "skb->ip_summed" is "CHECKSUM_PARTIAL", the patch checks the IP protocol. If it is TCP, the "IPCS" (IP Checksum) and "TCPCS" (TCP Checksum) flags are set in the "ctrl" variable. If it is UDP, the "IPCS" and "UDPCS" flags are set. Otherwise, it is considered a bug.

6. Finally, the "opts1" field of the descriptor is set with the value of the "ctrl" variable.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the call to `cpsw_ale_stop()` function from the `cpsw_ale_destroy()` function in the `cpsw_ale.c` file. The reason for this change is to avoid a deadlock that occurs when the `ti_cpsw` module is inserted and removed.

The deadlock is caused by a delete timer that is created and destroyed in the `cpsw_ale_start()` and `cpsw_ale_stop()` functions, which are called during device open and close operations. The deadlock is triggered when the `ti_cpsw` module is removed using `modprobe -r ti_cpsw`.

The patch removes the call to `cpsw_ale_stop()` from `cpsw_ale_destroy()` to prevent the deadlock. Instead, it only sets the ALE control to disable and frees the memory allocated for the `ale` structure.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a deadlock issue and improves the stability of the `ti_cpsw` module when inserted and removed.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the request_region() and release_region() calls for the VMMOUSE_PROTO_PORT. This port is reserved by the ACPI module during system startup, making it unavailable for other drivers to reserve. The patch suggests that VMMOUSE should not try to reserve this port on its own.

2. The patch checks if the VMMOUSE device is present by sending a command and checking the response. If the device is not present, it returns -ENXIO.

3. If the device is present, the patch sets the vendor, name, and model properties of the psmouse structure.

4. The patch removes the release_region() call in the vmmouse_disconnect() function, as it is no longer necessary.

5. The patch removes the request_region() and release_region() calls in the vmmouse_init() function, as they are no longer needed.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a problem with the interrupt flags on Rx LL2.
   - The patch description explains that the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

2. Fix: The patch modifies the qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() function to pass the lock_flags as a pointer (unsigned long *p_lock_flags) instead of a value (unsigned long lock_flags). This allows the function to update the flags with the most recent irqsave() flags.

3. Impact: The patch ensures that the interrupt status is correctly handled at the end of the processing, preventing any potential issues caused by incorrect interrupt flags.

4. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear link to the problem it addresses.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue described. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit b0d0d915, which removed the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) in the ipx module. The regression causes a deadlock scenario when a recvmsg syscall blocks waiting for new data, preventing data from being sent on the same socket with sendmsg.

2. The patch explains that the previous implementation with BKL unlocked while sleeping, allowing concurrent sendmsg operations. However, after the removal of BKL, a blocking recvmsg would block a concurrent sendmsg.

3. The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while working with the socket data and releases it before calling skb_recv_datagram().

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs and review acknowledgments.

Overall, the patch addresses a regression and fixes a locking issue in the ipx module. It is a targeted fix that improves the stability and functionality of the module. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The patch fixes a problem where the DEAD flag may contaminate the percpu pointer if __ref_is_percpu() races with percpu_ref_kill(). This contamination can occur because the __ref_is_percpu() function only tests the ATOMIC flag to determine if the ref is in percpu mode or not.

2. The proposed fix: The patch updates __ref_is_percpu() to test both the ATOMIC and DEAD flags before returning the percpu pointer. This ensures that the pointer is not contaminated with the DEAD flag.

3. Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by: The patch has been signed-off-by Tejun Heo and reviewed by Shaohua Li, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

4. Fixes tag: The patch includes a "Fixes" tag that references the commit (f47ad4578461) it fixes, indicating that it addresses a specific issue.

5. Link to discussion: The patch includes a link to the discussion thread on the LKML mailing list, providing additional context and discussion around the patch.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is well-documented, addresses a specific issue, and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes a check that restricts the minimum length of GETLAYOUT requests in the nfsd/blocklayout module.
2. The patch justifies the removal by referring to RFC 5661 section 18.43.3, which states that servers should not impose restrictions on layouts.
3. The patch also mentions that some clients experience indefinite hangs on fsx runs due to this restriction.
4. The patch is signed-off by two reputable contributors, Christoph Hellwig and J. Bruce Fields.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch modifies the `loop_clr_fd` function in `drivers/block/loop.c`.
2. Previously, the code issued a `BLKRRPART` ioctl to clean up partitions if `LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN` was set, which meant that the partitions were auto-scanned on attach.
3. The patch replaces the `BLKRRPART` ioctl with code that unconditionally cleans up partitions on detach.
4. Additionally, the patch removes all partitions explicitly, as `BLKRRPART` won't remove user-added partitions when `max_part=0`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a bug where partitions added by user space to the loop device were not being cleaned up after detaching the loop device. The new code ensures that partitions are always cleaned up on detach, regardless of the `LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN` flag. This fix improves the stability and reliability of the loop device functionality.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to reading a maximally sized remote attribute when CRCs are enabled. The verification error occurs because the length of the buffer being read is determined incorrectly, leading to a too short mapped length.

2. The patch proposes two changes to fix the issue. First, it suggests calculating the buffer length directly from the value length, taking into account CRC headers. Second, it suggests calculating the data space in the buffer before determining the actual byte count of data, considering that the buffer might be longer due to headers.

3. The patch is signed-off by Dave Chinner and reviewed by Ben Myers, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

4. The patch is cherry-picked from commit 913e96bc292e1bb248854686c79d6545ef3ee720, which suggests that it has already been tested and proven to be effective.

5. The changes made in the patch are specific to the "fs/xfs/xfs_attr_remote.c" file, indicating that it targets a specific area of the codebase.

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue it addresses. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in multiple files under the `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon` directory. It adjusts the thermal protection requirements for certain GPU models (rv770 and newer) in the Radeon driver.

The change removes the dependency on clock gating for thermal protection and instead checks if the GPU has a thermal sensor (`rdev->pm.int_thermal_type != THERMAL_TYPE_NONE`). If a thermal sensor is present, the `pi->thermal_protection` flag is set to true; otherwise, it is set to false.

This change simplifies the thermal protection logic by removing the unnecessary dependency on clock gating. It ensures that thermal protection is enabled as long as a thermal sensor is present, regardless of clock gating.

Since this change improves the thermal protection mechanism and does not introduce any new issues, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 4e752f0ab0e8, which moved the function ceph_get_snap_context() from rbd_img_request_create() to rbd_queue_workfn(). This change resulted in an extra put operation on snapc, which is unnecessary.

To fix this, the patch sets snapc to NULL after assigning it to img_request->rq, indicating that img_request consumes a reference to snapc. This ensures that ceph_put_snap_context() is not called unnecessarily.

The patch also includes the necessary metadata, such as the Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org tag, indicating that it should be considered for stable releases. It is also signed-off by the author and reviewed by relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a straightforward fix without introducing any new concerns. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes a double-free bug that occurs when the next beacon is sent in the ath9k driver.

2. The bug is described as follows: When a new beacon is generated, the ath_buf from the previous run is reused. If getting a new beacon from mac80211 fails, the bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, but the skb (socket buffer) is freed. This leads to a double-free on the next beacon transmission attempt, resulting in a system crash.

3. The patch fixes the bug by explicitly setting bf->bf_mpdu to NULL after freeing the skb. This ensures that the double-free issue does not occur.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

5. The patch is also marked for stable release, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific bug and has the necessary approvals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: data corruption observed during a read/write stress test in the ti-qspi driver.
2. The patch explains that writing an invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG terminates the current transfer and de-asserts the chip select. This needs to be done before calling spi_finalize_current_message() to avoid data corruption.
3. The patch mentions that __spi_pump_message() can be called from either a kthread worker context or directly from the calling process's context, and there is a possibility of a race condition between these two calls.
4. The race condition is serialized by checking whether master->cur_msg == NULL, which indicates the message being handled by transfer_one() at present. spi_finalize_current_message() sets master->cur_msg to NULL when called on that message, allowing __spi_sync() to pump the next message in the calling process's context.
5. However, if spi-ti-qspi calls spi_finalize_current_message() before terminating the transfer at the hardware side, and if __spi_pump_message() is called from the process context, the successive transactions can overlap, leading to data corruption.
6. The patch fixes this issue by moving the writing of the invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG before calling spi_finalize_current_message().

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
