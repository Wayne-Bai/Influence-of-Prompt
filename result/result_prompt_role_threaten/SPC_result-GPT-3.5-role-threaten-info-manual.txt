Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the z13 architecture in the s390 facilities. The patch modifies the facility_defs structure in the facilities_src.h file to include the load-and-zero-rightmost-byte facility and load/store-on-condition facility 2.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the provided patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses.

Without additional information, it is difficult to determine the significance of this patch. If it is addressing a critical bug, security issue, or a significant problem that affects the stability or functionality of the Linux kernel on z13 architecture, then it may be appropriate for inclusion in the -stable releases. However, if it is a trivial change or does not address any critical issues, it may not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases unless further details are provided to demonstrate its significance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to NFS remount attempts. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds two new conditions to the `nfs_compare_remount_data` function:
   - `data->version != nfss->nfs_client->rpc_ops->version`
   - `data->minorversion != nfss->nfs_client->cl_minorversion`

2. The patch also adds two assignments in the `nfs_remount` function:
   - `data->version = nfsvers`
   - `data->minorversion = nfss->nfs_client->cl_minorversion`

3. The purpose of these changes is to reject remount attempts if the NFS version or minor version has changed.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to NFS remount attempts. It ensures that version and minor version changes are rejected during remount, which could potentially prevent compatibility issues or unexpected behavior.

Considering that this patch fixes a specific issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a sparse error by accessing __iomem directly.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an obsoleted check in the ext4 file system code. The patch removes a condition that checks if a buffer head (bh) is NULL or if the current directory entry (de) is beyond the buffer head's data. The patch also includes a comment stating that the necessary checks have already been done.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple conditional modification in the ath9k_hw_reset() function in the hw.c file of the ath9k driver. The patch checks if the MCI (Memory Controller Interface) is disabled before programming the OBS (Outbound Stream) register.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided patch, it does not seem to fix any of the mentioned critical issues. It is a conditional modification that skips programming the OBS register if MCI is enabled. This change does not address any known critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a small inline wrapper for the `device_tx_status` callback of a DMA device. This change aims to make the code more compact and legible for users of this function.

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only improves code readability and does not fix any substantial issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/i915/vlv: check port in infoframe_enabled v2" and it suggests checking the port in the infoframe_enabled function for the VLV (Valleyview) platform. It also mentions that this change is similar to the IBX (Ibex Peak) and G4x platforms.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by three individuals: Jesse Barnes, Rodrigo Vivi, and Daniel Vetter. This indicates that these individuals have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the vlv_infoframe_enabled function in the intel_hdmi.c file. It adds a check for the port using the intel_dig_port structure and compares it with the port value obtained from the VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK. If the port matches, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between val and VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE. Otherwise, it returns false.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the bug being fixed by this patch. The patch seems to be adding a necessary check for the port in the infoframe_enabled function for the VLV platform. However, without more context or information about the bug being fixed, it is challenging to assess its criticality.

   Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. Recommendation:
   Given the limited information available, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. More information about the bug being fixed and its criticality would be required for a thorough analysis.

   Therefore, based on the available information, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, further investigation and analysis are necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the file `net/sched/sch_generic.c` in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch adds a check for the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag in two places where the `dev->tx_queue_len` is checked.

3. In the first check, the patch adds `!(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE)` as an additional condition to enter the if statement. This means that if `dev->tx_queue_len` is non-zero and the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is not set, the code inside the if statement will be executed.

4. In the second check, the patch adds `dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE` as an additional condition to enter the if statement. This means that if `dev->tx_queue_len` is zero, or the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set, the code inside the if statement will be executed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary condition to handle the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero. This change seems to address a potential issue related to the handling of network device queues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real and critical bug or issue related to network device queue handling.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that switches from using `module_init` and `module_exit` to `module_platform_driver` for the `gpio_ir_recv` driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant "break" statements after "goto" statements. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds error checking for the `dev_alloc_skb()` call in the `amsdu_to_msdu()` function. If the allocation fails, the patch breaks out of the loop, indicating a failure. This is a good practice as it ensures that the driver handles allocation failures properly.

2. The patch also adds error checking for the `skb_clone()` call in the `recvbuf2recvframe()` function. If the cloning fails, the patch returns `_FAIL`, indicating a failure. This is important to prevent potential issues with using a NULL pointer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver. It improves error handling and prevents potential crashes or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the function `hp_amp_power_on` static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the control initialization in the ASoC ak4642 codec driver to a table-based approach. The patch removes the call to `snd_soc_add_codec_controls` and instead initializes the `controls` and `num_controls` fields directly in the `soc_codec_dev_ak4642` and `soc_codec_dev_ak4648` structures.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing newline characters ("\n") to the end of dev_err messages in the s390/dasd driver. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses a cosmetic issue by adding newlines to improve the formatting of error messages.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the hns driver in the Linux kernel. The patch replaces the usage of `device_node` with `fwnode_handle` in several functions, indicating a change in the way device nodes are handled in the driver.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it seems to address a real issue related to device node handling, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check. The patch removes the check for `dst == NULL` in the `ip6t_SYNPROXY` module, as it is stated that `ip6_route_output()` will never return a NULL pointer.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch switches over to the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. This is a good practice as it ensures the use of standardized and recommended functions.

2. The patch removes the TODO item related to the TMU clocksource. This indicates that the patch addresses a long-standing issue, which is a positive sign.

3. The patch replaces the calculation of shift, mult, max_delta_ns, and min_delta_ns with a call to clockevents_config(). This simplifies the code and makes it more maintainable.

4. The patch also updates the clockevents_register_device() function call to clockevents_config_and_register(). This ensures that the clock event device is properly configured and registered.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by using the recommended clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() functions. It also removes a long-standing TODO item. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the staging iio drivers "adis16209" and "adis16240". The patch replaces the custom event handler functions "adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll" and "adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll" with the generic function "iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll". 

The generic function "iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll" is a part of the IIO (Industrial I/O) framework and is responsible for handling data ready triggers. By using this generic function, the patch ensures consistency and reduces code duplication across the drivers.

Since this patch fixes a real bug and improves code maintainability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized variable issue in the ath9k driver. The warning message suggests that the variable "npend" may be used uninitialized in the "ath9k_has_tx_pending" function.

Since this is a warning and not an error, it does not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential bugs.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fact that it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. It falls under the category of a code quality improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new function called `calibration_delay_done()` with a dummy implementation. This function is used to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and can be used by architectures to stop accepting delay timer registrations.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not address any existing issues or provide any significant improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the manual calculation of the address with a helper function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused variable 'neigh' from the 'dn_output()' function in the 'dn_route.c' file of the DECnet subsystem. The removal of this unused variable does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds support for VB2_DMABUF in the davinci vpbe driver.
   - This indicates that the patch is adding functionality to the driver.

2. The change is made in the vpbe_display_probe() function.
   - This function is responsible for initializing the display device.

3. The patch modifies the "io_modes" field of the buffer queue structure.
   - It adds VB2_DMABUF to the existing VB2_MMAP and VB2_USERPTR flags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding support for the VB2_DMABUF mode in the davinci vpbe driver. This mode allows for sharing video buffers using DMA buffers, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

However, based on the criteria for accepting patches in -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any real issues. It is adding a new feature to the driver, which is not considered a critical fix.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a manual swapping operation with the `swap()` macro defined in `kernel.h`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (replacing a few lines of code with a macro), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing superfluous address-of operators and unneeded casts. It also updates the printk format specifier to use %p for pointers.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the `ioctl` function with `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. This change is specific to the `radio-bcm2048` driver and does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the variable name `PIDVEC_SIZE` to `max_items` in the `f2fs` file system's `gang_lookup_pids` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a simple renaming of a variable, which falls under the category of a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the condition `if (oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID)` and the corresponding `LASSERT` statement.
2. The condition `if (oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLGROUP)` is kept.
3. The assignment `lsm->lsm_oi = oa->o_oi` is moved outside the removed condition.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, let's evaluate this patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? - No, the patch does not fix a bug. It removes a condition that is always true, but it does not address any specific issue.
2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? - No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.
3. Does the patch fix a real security issue? - No, the patch does not address a security issue.
4. Does the patch address an "oh, that's not good" issue? - No, the patch does not fix any problematic behavior.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would conclude that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not fix a critical bug, address a security issue, or improve any problematic behavior.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()` in the `sdev_store_delete()` function. 

The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple code improvement that makes the "delete" behavior synchronous.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial cleanup change that removes an unnecessary forward declaration. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that introduces a local variable "handle" for economy of expression. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `platform_device_put` function call in the error path of the `raumfeld_audio_init` function. This fix ensures that the platform device is properly released in case of an error during the `platform_device_add` call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for the McASPs on the ARM Davinci DM646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and are associated with specific IRQ numbers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about a bug, error, hang, data corruption, or security issue that it resolves. It seems to be adding interrupt resources for potential error recovery, but without further context, it is difficult to assess the significance of this change.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It appears to be a specific functional change related to interrupt handling.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. More context and details about the bug or issue it addresses would be necessary for a proper evaluation. Therefore, my analysis would be inconclusive, and I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) until further information is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch modifies the parsing of the DAPM routes map in the simple-card driver, making it optional based on the presence of the "simple-audio-routing" property.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to inconsistent indenting in the i915_error_state_to_str() function. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend giving it a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to add an option to skip sync on DMA map in the arch/avr32 folder. It mentions that the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC was not consistent across all DMA APIs in the arch/arm folder, and this change is meant to correct that for consistent behavior.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the avr32_dma_map_page() and avr32_dma_map_sg() functions in the arch/avr32/mm/dma-coherent.c file.

   In the avr32_dma_map_page() function:
   - The patch adds a condition to check if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set in the attrs parameter.
   - If the flag is not set, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA memory.

   In the avr32_dma_map_sg() function:
   - The patch adds a similar condition to check if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set in the attrs parameter.
   - If the flag is set, it continues to the next scatterlist entry without calling dma_cache_sync().
   - If the flag is not set, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA memory.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to ensure consistent behavior for the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC across DMA APIs in the arch/avr32 folder. It introduces an option to skip the synchronization of CPU cache with DMA memory if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set.

   Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an improvement or consistency fix rather than addressing a critical issue.

   Therefore, based on the given criteria, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a calculation with the DIV_ROUND_UP macro. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the PCTV 340eSE device to the dib0700 driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a USB ID for the PCTV 340eSE device to the dib0700_usb_id_table. This indicates that the patch is adding support for a specific hardware device.

2. The patch also adds a corresponding entry in the dvb_usb_device_properties structure, which includes the device name and the USB ID. This is necessary for the driver to recognize and handle the device correctly.

3. In the dvb-usb-ids.h file, the USB PID (Product ID) for the PCTV 340eSE is defined.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding support for a specific hardware device to the dib0700 driver. This does not seem to fix a critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch seems to be a trivial addition rather than a critical fix.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the name of a signal from "DE" to "DISP" in the rcar-du driver for the DRM subsystem. This change is made to clarify that the DISP pin outputs the DISP signal.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the IRQ handler function `bq27xxx_battery_irq_handler_thread` to the appropriate section in the code. This change resolves a warning related to the handler being defined but not used when the `CONFIG_BQ27XXX_I2C` configuration is not enabled.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes an indentation issue in the `struct amdgpu_ring` definition, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Trivial fixes, such as indentation changes, do not address real and critical bugs or issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check of the status_code in ERSP_IU.
   - This indicates that the patch is adding a validation step to ensure the status_code is properly checked.

2. The patch is signed-off by James Smart, Sagi Grimberg, and Jens Axboe.
   - The sign-off indicates that the authors have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. The patch is reviewed by Johannes Thumshirn and Christoph Hellwig.
   - The review by other experienced developers adds credibility to the patch.

4. In the code changes, a new condition is added to the if statement.
   - The condition checks if the status_code is non-zero.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is adding a necessary check for the status_code in ERSP_IU. This check is important for ensuring proper error handling and preventing potential issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the private copy of `struct net_device_stats` in `struct port_info` and instead uses the stats from `struct net_device`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not introduce any new functionality or significant improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only removes redundant code and does not address any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix rather than a trivial change. The patch modifies the `ipmmu_probe` function in the `shmobile-ipmmu.c` file. 

The patch addresses the issue of ignoring the return value of the `ipmmu_iommu_init` function. By changing the return statement to `return ipmmu_iommu_init(ipmmu)`, the patch ensures that the function's return value is not ignored.

Since the patch fixes a potential issue of ignoring an error value, it can be considered a non-trivial fix. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug and its impact would be necessary for a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new parameter "int rw" to the function "__extent_read_full_page" in "extent_io.c". This parameter is used to specify the type of IO operation (READ or WRITE). This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch also adds the "int rw" parameter to the function "extent_read_full_page" in "extent_io.c". This function calls "__extent_read_full_page" and passes the "rw" parameter as "READ". Again, this change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

3. The patch modifies the "write_one_eb" function in "extent_io.c" to set the "rw" parameter based on the value of "epd->sync_io". It also adds the "REQ_META" flag to the "rw" parameter. This change seems to be related to metadata IO and IO throttling cqroups. It does not introduce any trivial fixes.

4. The patch modifies the "extent_readpages" function in "extent_io.c" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" and add the "REQ_META" flag to the "rw" parameter. This change is consistent with the previous modifications and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

5. The patch modifies the "read_extent_buffer_pages" function in "extent_io.c" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" and add the "REQ_META" flag to the "rw" parameter. This change is consistent with the previous modifications and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a functional change related to metadata IO and IO throttling cqroups. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding initial support for the GP104 chipset in the Nouveau driver. However, the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial fix as it only adds a single line of code to assign a function pointer to the "mc" field in the nv134_chipset structure.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for distinguishing between i.MX23 and i.MX28 SoC variants in the MXS touchscreen driver. This fix is necessary to make the touchscreen work on i.MX23.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a specific fix for distinguishing between SoC variants.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix default UVD context size" and it suggests a fix for the default UVD context size in the AMDGPU driver.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the "amdgpu_uvd_cs_msg_decode" function in the "amdgpu_uvd.c" file. Specifically, it changes the initialization of the "min_ctx_size" variable from 0 to ~0 (all bits set to 1).

3. Context: The patch is related to the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) functionality in the AMDGPU driver. UVD is responsible for hardware-accelerated video decoding on AMD GPUs.

4. Analysis: The patch aims to fix the default UVD context size by setting the "min_ctx_size" variable to its maximum value (~0) instead of 0. This change suggests that context buffers should be denied by default, rather than allowed.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further investigation and additional information are required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the ARM shmobile rcar-gen2 platform. The patch adds more register documentation and includes some changes to the register definitions and initialization code.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a non-functional change aimed at improving documentation and code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch disables the centroid pixel performance optimization for BDW-A.
   - It is a workaround for BDW Bug #1899532.
   - It includes a WARN message when not using preliminary HW support.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new definition `GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS` in `i915_reg.h`.
   - It writes the value `_MASKED_BIT_ENABLE(GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS)` to the register `HALF_SLICE_CHICKEN3` in `intel_pm.c`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific bug (#1899532) related to the BDW architecture.
   - It disables the centroid pixel optimization, which suggests that the optimization may cause issues or is not functioning correctly.
   - The addition of the WARN message helps to identify when preliminary HW support is not being used.
   - The patch does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug, provides a workaround, and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new define called "DEBUG_UART_SHIFT" and removes the variable "shift" from all functions in uncompress.h. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary casting. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any functional improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary operation. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds defines for exit codes in the kselftest framework. It does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues. 

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a struct in the drm/edid module. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to the initialization of the 5/10MHz channel width on the ar9003 chipset for the ath9k driver. 

The patch moves the call to `ath9k_hw_set_rfmode()` after `ath9k_hw_process_ini()` in order to avoid overwriting the AR_PHY_MODE register with default values during the initialization process.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the channel width on the ar9003 chipset. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue, it could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or suboptimal performance of the wireless driver.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not appear to contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It seems to fix a specific issue that could impact the functionality or performance of the ath9k driver on the ar9003 chipset.
false || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a suspicious RCU usage warning in the net/sched/cls_tcindex.c file.

2. The warning indicates that there is a potential issue with RCU (Read-Copy-Update) usage in the code.

3. The patch modifies the tcindex_classify() function by changing the rcu_dereference() call to rcu_dereference_bh().

4. The change suggests that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to RCU usage in a specific context.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to RCU usage and fixes a warning that could potentially lead to problems such as data corruption or hangs.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the display of cache options in /proc/mounts and deprecates the display of other options.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The patch adds error messages to be printed when firmware fails to be requested in the case of platform data being used. This indicates that there is a potential problem with firmware retrieval.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve adding error messages to differentiate between the device tree and platform data cases.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not seem to introduce any new bugs or regressions. They simply add error messages to improve error reporting.

4. The patch is signed-off and acked: The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to address the issue of firmware retrieval failure and improve error reporting in the imx-sdma driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel panic issue caused by a recursive recovery during boot. The patch checks the state of the wl->state variable before queuing a new recovery, ensuring that the hardware is not already stopped.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to a kernel panic. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0` driver in the AMDGPU DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` status of the DCE (Display Core Engine) IP block accordingly.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue. 

From the patch, it seems that the purpose of `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` is to update the hang status of the DCE IP block based on the display's hung state. While this may be useful for internal monitoring or debugging purposes, it does not appear to fix a real and critical bug or address a significant issue that would cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. However, it does not seem to meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. This change does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the HID Wacom driver. The current code checks if the first byte of the data received from the device is 0x03 to determine if it is a tablet report. However, this check is only valid for Wacom Graphire devices, as their reports always start with 0x03. The patch modifies the code to perform the check only for Wacom Graphire Bluetooth devices and adds an error message for unknown reports.

The patch fixes a potential issue where valid reports from Intuos4 WL high-speed devices (which start with 0x04) would be filtered out. This is not a trivial fix as it addresses a specific device behavior and prevents data corruption.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Ping Cheng, a recognized contributor from Wacom. This adds credibility to the patch and suggests that it has been thoroughly reviewed by domain experts.

Therefore, considering the critical bug fix, the non-trivial nature of the fix, and the positive review, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the Lustre staging driver in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a null pointer dereference issue that could potentially lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that could cause a hang or data corruption. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, my analysis is that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the output level in the tpic2810_direction_output function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a trivial fix, I would classify it as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The changes made in the patch involve removing unnecessary calls to the `ipset_nest_end` function in the error paths of three different files (`ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`).

Since the patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only removes some unnecessary function calls, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug in the acpi_power_meter driver that causes the kernel to crash when it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. This bug can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The patch replaces the use of the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro. The BUG() macro is used to indicate a fatal error condition, while the WARN() macro is used to issue a warning message without crashing the kernel. This change ensures that the kernel does not crash unnecessarily and allows the system to continue running with degraded functionality instead.

3. The patch includes appropriate error messages in the WARN() calls, providing useful information about the unexpected attribute index or event that triggered the warning. This helps in diagnosing and troubleshooting the issue.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the critical bug and improving the stability of the system.

Considering the above points, this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause system crashes and potential data corruption.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a configuration change for the target_core_device.c file in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch changes the initialization of the `buf` variable from a fixed size array to an array initialized with the string "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1". This change suggests that the patch is modifying the configuration parameters for the virtual_lun0 device.

2. The patch then allocates a new host bus adapter (HBA) using the `core_alloc_hba` function and assigns it to the `hba` variable.

3. Next, the patch creates a new target_core_device using the `core_alloc_device` function and assigns it to the `dev` variable.

4. The patch sets the configuration parameters for the `dev` using the `hba->transport->set_configfs_dev_params` function, passing the `buf` variable and its size as arguments. However, the `buf` variable is no longer being used to store the configuration parameters, as it was initialized with a fixed string in step 1.

5. Finally, the patch calls the `target_configure_device` function to configure the `dev` and assigns the return value to the `ret` variable.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is making a configuration change for the virtual_lun0 device by setting the parameters "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1". However, there is no indication that this change fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, the patch includes a trivial fix by removing the unnecessary `memset` and `sprintf` calls.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant assignment for the "gpio->da9052" variable in the "da9052_gpio_probe" function. This redundant assignment does not seem to cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical bugs.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix, as it only removes redundant code and does not address any real or critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that staticizes some symbols in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The purpose of this change is to address warnings related to symbols not being declared and to silence those warnings.

false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite" and it includes changes to the file `drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/llite/llite_mmap.c`.

The patch adds a call to `file_update_time(vma->vm_file)` before invoking `ll_page_mkwrite0()` function. This change updates the file times if `page_mkwrite` is not set.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the following criteria:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue it addresses. It appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that makes the "pxa255_run_freqs" and "pxa255_turbo_freqs" arrays const. The patch also updates the arrays declaration, "find_freq_tables()" function, and its callsites.

The patch is suggested by Joe Perches and signed-off by Fabian Frederick and Rafael J. Wysocki. It modifies the "drivers/cpufreq/pxa2xx-cpufreq.c" file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix that makes the arrays const, which falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc."

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "staging: comedi: s626: remove I2CR and I2CW macros." It suggests removing the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros and expanding them in place.

2. Purpose of the Patch:
   The `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros are used for I2C read and write addresses in the `s626` driver of the `comedi` staging driver. The patch aims to remove these macros and expand them directly in the code.

3. Impact of the Patch:
   The patch modifies the code in the `s626` driver, specifically in the `I2Cread` function. It replaces the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros with the `devpriv->I2CAdrs` variable.

4. Analysis:
   The `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros are only used once each in the code and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion. The patch removes these macros and expands them directly in place using the `devpriv->I2CAdrs` variable.

   The change seems reasonable as it simplifies the code by removing unnecessary macros and directly using the `devpriv->I2CAdrs` variable. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bug, but it improves code readability and maintainability.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does improve code readability and maintainability by removing unnecessary macros.

   Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, specifically a whitespace cleanup, and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the kernel/sched/core.c file. The patch adds the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the enqueue_task() function calls in several places.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. However, the patch itself does not provide any context or explanation of the problem it aims to solve.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the significance of this patch. As an AI, I cannot make assumptions or speculate on the potential impact of the changes. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and clarification from the patch author or the relevant kernel maintainers to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes clock names in the driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any impact on the stability or functionality of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces the `->get_direction()` callback for the `gpio-pca953x` driver. This callback allows retrieving the direction of a GPIO pin. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a functional enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the initcall_sync variants in init.h to fix build errors. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements:
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint PCH
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint LP PCH

2. The purpose of these WARN_ON statements is to generate a warning message if the condition is not met. In this case, the condition is checking whether the detected PCH is paired with an ULT CPU.

3. The WARN_ON statements indicate that if the condition is not met, it is considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue where the PCH is not paired with the correct CPU, which can lead to unexpected behavior or instability. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause an "oh, that's not good" issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the conditional logic to check for an error code instead of a success code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err` in the `cpsw_probe_dt` function in the `cpsw.c` file. This change improves consistency in error reporting by using the appropriate function for device-specific error messages.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a checkpatch issue related to alignment in the ni_labpc.c file.
   - This is a trivial fix and does not address any real or critical bug.
   - Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering the above analysis, the Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to improve consistency by suggesting breaking lines before operators instead of after them.

2. The patch includes changes in the ni_labpc.c file, specifically in the labpc_ai_cmd() function and the labpc_common_attach() function.

3. In the labpc_ai_cmd() function, the patch modifies the assignment of the "chanspec" variable. It changes the line from:
   ```
   unsigned int chanspec = (mode == MODE_MULT_CHAN_UP)
                           ? cmd->chanlist[cmd->chanlist_len - 1]
                           : cmd->chanlist[0];
   ```
   to:
   ```
   unsigned int chanspec = (mode == MODE_MULT_CHAN_UP) ?
                           cmd->chanlist[cmd->chanlist_len - 1] :
                           cmd->chanlist[0];
   ```
   This change breaks the line before the ternary operator.

4. In the labpc_common_attach() function, the patch modifies the assignment of the "s->range_table" variable. It changes the line from:
   ```
   s->range_table = board->is_labpc1200
                    ? &range_labpc_1200_ai : &range_labpc_plus_ai;
   ```
   to:
   ```
   s->range_table = board->is_labpc1200 ?
                    &range_labpc_1200_ai : &range_labpc_plus_ai;
   ```
   This change breaks the line before the ternary operator.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only suggests a coding style change for consistency.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function in the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset. The function `s_vGetFreeContext` is renamed to `vnt_get_free_context`. 

Since this patch only involves a function name change and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash due to a null dereference and adds error handling for a failed kzalloc allocation. This patch does not seem to address any critical bugs that cause build errors, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it does not address any significant issues.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a channel mismatch issue in the ASoC ak4642 codec driver. The patch updates the minimum number of channels for both playback and capture streams from 1 to 2.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a channel mismatch issue, which can lead to incorrect audio playback or capture.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues. It is more of a functional bug related to audio channel configuration.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific functional issue.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a functional bug fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the ethtool API usage in the virtio_net driver. The patch replaces the deprecated ethtool {get|set}_settings API with the new {get|set}_link_ksettings API.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch replaces the use of smp_mb() with smp_store_mb/release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin/end() functions in the KVM/x86 code.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues either.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to document the optional print_limit argument for the '--call-graph' command line option in the perf report tool. It also suggests using strtoul() to parse the option since its type is u32.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to address a documentation issue and improve the parsing of the '--call-graph' option. These changes do not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix.

According to the given criteria, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, and documentation improvements should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue related to deleting only created queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch uses the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues. This change ensures that the controller returns an invalid queue identifier error to commands if a queue wasn't created. This approach is considered more correct.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Saar Gross.

4. The patch is signed-off by Keith Busch and reviewed by Christoph Hellwig.

5. The patch modifies the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function in the `drivers/nvme/host/pci.c` file.

6. The patch updates the `pass` variable to use the `dev->online_queues - 1` value instead of `dev->queue_count - 1`.

7. The patch updates the `i` variable to use the `queues` value instead of `dev->queue_count - 1`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue related to deleting only created queues in the NVMe driver and improves the correctness of the code.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the blackfin PTP driver. The patch converts the gettime and settime functions to use struct timespec64 instead of struct timespec, allowing the driver to handle 64-bit nanoseconds and be ready for the year 2038.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue related to time handling, it can be considered a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new macro called VA_START. This macro is intended to replace the lengthy expression (UL(0xffffffffffffffff) << VA_BITS) used in multiple places within the codebase.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the bcm-kona GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds two new functions: `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` and `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown`. These functions are responsible for locking and unlocking the hardware IRQ associated with the GPIO line.

2. The `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` function locks the hardware IRQ using the `gpio_lock_as_irq` function. If the lock is successful, the GPIO IRQ is unmasked, and the function returns 0. Otherwise, it logs an error message.

3. The `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown` function masks the GPIO IRQ and unlocks the hardware IRQ using the `gpio_unlock_as_irq` function.

4. The `bcm_gpio_irq_chip` structure is updated to include the new `irq_startup` and `irq_shutdown` function pointers, which will be used to handle the GPIO IRQ startup and shutdown operations.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a critical issue related to locking and unlocking the hardware IRQ associated with the GPIO line. This fix ensures proper synchronization and prevents potential issues such as data corruption or system instability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to system issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call initializes the "icount" structure to zero, but since the structure is allocated using kzalloc, it is already zeroed out. Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Considering that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be classified as a trivial fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the soc_camera driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds support for reading from the video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a functional enhancement and not a trivial fix.

2. It includes a debug line to print a message when the read function is called. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.

3. The patch checks if the camera bus driver supports the Video Buffer 2 (vb2) framework and if the video device is opened in read mode. If both conditions are met, it calls the vb2_read function to perform the read operation.

4. If the camera bus driver does not support reading or the video device is not opened in read mode, the patch returns an error (-EINVAL) and prints an error message.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue by adding support for reading from the video device if the camera bus driver supports it. It also includes a debug line for better debugging capabilities. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() in the rcutorture test. The purpose of this change is to test the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   No, this patch does not fix a bug. It adds a test case to the rcutorture test to verify the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, this patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a compile issue in the obd_mount.c file of the Lustre staging driver. The issue is related to the variable "index" not being initialized before it is used in the lmd_make_exclusion function.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it falls under the category of a real and critical bug. However, it does not seem to cause any oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, it may not be considered a high-priority fix for inclusion in a stable release.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch may not be suitable for inclusion in a stable release. It seems to be a relatively trivial fix that addresses a specific build issue rather than a critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check that is not doing anything useful. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the spi-armada-3700 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the removal of the ".owner" field.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add a handler function for the Periodic Inquiry command complete event in the Bluetooth subsystem. However, without further details about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine its significance or criticality.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that this patch addresses. Specifically, I would need to know if the bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix provided by this patch is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more details about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix, and any additional relevant information, so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the OVSP_LOCAL constant from a 16-bit unsigned integer (__u16) to a 32-bit unsigned integer (__u32). This change aligns the OVSP_LOCAL constant with the new 32-bit OVS ports.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless initialization of the variable 'ret'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

4. Looking at the code changes, it appears that the patch updates the plane state for the primary plane during initialization in two places: intel_find_initial_plane_obj() and intel_modeset_gem_init() functions.

5. In intel_find_initial_plane_obj(), the patch sets the crtc pointer for the primary plane's state and updates the plane_mask for the crtc.

6. In intel_modeset_gem_init(), the patch sets the crtc pointer and updates the plane_mask to remove the primary plane.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is making necessary updates to the plane state during initialization for the Intel i915 graphics driver. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if the patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would lean towards (B) not accepting the patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug or issue being addressed would be required to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch moves duplicated callback functions from the codec driver to the component driver in the ASoC subsystem for the wm9713 codec. This change improves code organization and eliminates the need for the quick-hack of copying functions from the codec side to the component side during register timing.

The patch does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves moving significant functionality from one driver to another. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other minor modifications.

Considering the patch's purpose of improving code organization and eliminating duplicated functions, it does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Based on the criteria provided, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it could be considered for inclusion in future non-stable releases or as part of a larger set of improvements.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch for the mac802154 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that only cleans up the code by changing the way the `open_count` variable is incremented and decremented.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "SRPT: Fix odd use of WARN_ON()". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the use of WARN_ON() in the SRPT driver.

2. The patch description mentions that while WARN_ON("const string") will work, its intent is not obvious. This implies that the current usage of WARN_ON() in the code is not clear and may lead to confusion.

3. The patch modifies the code at line 1374 in the file "drivers/infiniband/ulp/srpt/ib_srpt.c". It replaces the existing WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state") with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state).

4. The new WARN() statement includes the "state" value, which provides more useful information for debugging purposes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message by including the "state" value, which can aid in identifying and debugging unexpected command states in the SRPT driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the __must_check attribute to the return types of two functions in the dvb-usb driver. This attribute is used to indicate that the return value of a function must be checked by the caller.

While it is generally good practice to check return values for error handling, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a minor improvement to the code quality but does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces deprecated operations with their recommended counterparts. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix a bit toggling issue in the ixgbe driver for the 82599 network card. The current code does not toggle the correct bit to reset the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, including Don Skidmore, Phil Schmitt, Aaron Brown, and David S. Miller.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the ixgbe_reset_pipeline_82599 function in the ixgbe_82599.c file. Specifically, it updates the AUTOC register by toggling the LMS[2] bit and Restart_AN.

4. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to resetting the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion for the 82599 network card. The patch modifies the code to correctly toggle the required bit in the AUTOC register.

Considering the criticality of the bug and the fact that the patch fixes a specific issue without introducing any trivial changes, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure the patch's effectiveness and compatibility with the Linux kernel.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review by kernel maintainers and testing is necessary before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error when the PM_SLEEP is disabled. The issue is reported by Rhyland Klein and the patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Nvidia.

However, this patch seems to be a trivial fix as it only adds the "static inline" keyword to the function definition. It does not fix any critical bug, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the current task's state is set in the ipc/sem.c file. The patch replaces the direct assignment of the state with a call to the __set_current_state() function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a compile-time check for the size of the struct bt_skb_cb within the limits of skb->cb. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new module option called "nested" to the kvm_intel module. This option controls whether the guest can use VMX instructions, enabling or disabling nested virtualization.

2. The patch includes a comment explaining the purpose of the "nested" option and its default value, which is currently set to 0 (disabled).

3. The patch also adds a static variable called "nested" to store the value of the "nested" module option.

4. The patch includes a function called "nested_vmx_allowed" that checks whether a guest should be allowed to use VMX instructions and MSRs (nested VMX). It checks if the "nested" module option is enabled and if the guest's CPU supports VMX instructions.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, the patch introduces a new feature that allows controlling nested virtualization in the kvm_intel module. It does not fix any critical bugs, but it adds functionality that can be useful for certain use cases. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects some typos in the netvsc.c file. The changes involve fixing spelling errors in error messages. 

According to the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, trivial fixes such as spelling changes are not considered critical bugs. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a compatible string for the Amlogic Meson I2C controller. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves making local symbols static.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the "remain" variable from int to unsigned long. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing sanity check on the version-request payload size in the greybus driver. This is a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. 

The patch adds a check to ensure that the payload size is not smaller than the expected size. If the payload size is smaller, an error message is printed and the function returns with an error code.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential security issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "drm/nouveau/fifo/gk104" module of the Linux kernel. The patch aims to identify mmu engine ids for host faults and make changes to the gk104_fifo_fault_engine array.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to be a non-trivial fix that addresses a specific issue related to identifying mmu engine ids for host faults. It does not involve trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to review the bug report or the rationale behind the patch. Without that information, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a configuration issue in the Rockchip PCIe driver. The patch sets the Common Clock Configuration bit in the Link Control Register to indicate that Rockchip's RC is using a common clock architecture.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - No, the patch does not fix a bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It addresses a configuration issue.

2. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would conclude that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While it may be a valid fix for the Rockchip PCIe driver, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases as it does not fix a critical bug or address a significant issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the sunxi factors clock driver. The patch adds an unregister function for the factors clock, which was missing previously. This means that multiple structs were leaked whenever a factors clock was unregistered, which is a memory leak issue.

The patch also keeps pointers to the mux and gate structs so that they can be freed properly during the unregister process. This ensures that the memory allocated for these structs is released correctly.

Overall, this patch addresses a real issue and fixes a memory leak problem. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch adds a definition for the MAC_SM_RST register value, which represents the reset bit of the MAC status machine register.
2. In the `r6040_init_mac_regs` function, the patch replaces the hardcoded value of 2 with the newly defined MAC_SM_RST value when writing to the MAC_SM register. This ensures that the reset bit is correctly set.
3. Similarly, in the `r6040_mac_address` function, the patch replaces the hardcoded value of 2 with the MAC_SM_RST value when resetting the internal state machine.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the MAC status machine reset. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a critical bug or a real security issue.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). More information about the bug being fixed and its impact would be necessary for a proper analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new flag `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_1HZ` for 1 Hz resolution in the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem. This flag indicates that the tuner supports 1 Hz resolution.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial addition that does not address any critical problem.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing redundant assignments and correcting indentation. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue() function in the IB/mlx4/alias_GUID.c file. The patch replaces the deprecated function with alloc_ordered_workqueue() with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue by using a recommended replacement function, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freeing resources in the cleanup_perf_probe_events() function. The patch adds a call to clear_perf_probe_event() to properly free resources for perf probe events.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to resource leaks, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a necessary change to add the "dma_dir" parameter to the alloc memop in the vb2_queue_cancel function. This change is required for the next patch that needs to know the dma_dir for the dma-sg alloc memop.

The patch modifies the following files:
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-core.c
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-dma-contig.c
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-dma-sg.c
- drivers/media/v4l2-core/videobuf2-vmalloc.c
- include/media/videobuf2-core.h

The patch adds the "dma_dir" parameter to the vb2_buf_mem_alloc function in videobuf2-core.c and modifies the vb2_dc_alloc, vb2_dma_sg_alloc, and vb2_vmalloc_alloc functions in their respective files to include the "dma_dir" parameter.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is necessary for the proper functioning of the subsequent patch that requires the dma_dir information. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds some informational print statements to the simplefb driver. The added code does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "nice to have" addition for debugging purposes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unnecessary call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The reason for this removal is that the IRQ is allocated using `devm_request_irq`. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not fix any of the mentioned critical issues. It appears to be a cleanup or optimization change rather than addressing a specific bug or issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix, as it removes an unnecessary call to `free_irq`.

Based on the criteria provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The patch correctly addresses the issue by shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a non-trivial bug related to power state checks.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add variable resolution support to the gspca driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for variable resolution by allowing subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions. This indicates that the patch aims to enhance the functionality of the gspca driver.

2. The try_fmt function is called in the try_fmt_vid_cap function to pass the original resolution to the subdriver. This suggests that the patch intends to handle format modifications by the subdriver.

3. The vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function sets the current mode and pixfmt based on the subdriver's try_fmt function. If the subdriver does not have a try_fmt function, it falls back to the existing behavior.

4. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function calls the subdriver's enum_framesizes function if it exists, allowing the subdriver to handle frame size enumeration.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds functionality to the gspca driver without fixing any real and critical bugs or addressing any security issues. It appears to be an enhancement rather than a bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __dev* attributes in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are being removed due to the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option going away.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a checkpatch.pl warning about a line being over 80 characters. The patch adds a local variable called "scanned_queue" and uses it to simplify references in the rtw_createbss_cmd23a_callback() function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the `enum dio200_layout` to `enum dio200_layout_idx`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that involves renaming an enum and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change that improves the display of vendor information for imported USB devices.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices. The patch adds a new rate_update hook in the rate control algorithm and re-initializes the rate scaling (rs) when the hook is called. 

The patch also introduces a new parameter "init" in the rs_initialize_lq and iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init functions, which is used to control whether the rate scaling should be initialized or not. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems to address a bug related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver, which can impact the performance and stability of wireless connections. While the severity of the bug is not explicitly mentioned, rate scaling issues can cause significant problems in wireless communication.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly address any of these issues. It focuses on improving the rate scaling functionality.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a new parameter and modifies existing functions to handle rate scaling initialization.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential improvement rather than a critical bug fix. It does not directly address any of the mentioned critical issues, and the changes made are not significant enough to warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma". The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only removes redundant code. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch modifies the function `reconnect_one()` in the file `fs/exportfs/expfs.c`. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a network failure.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. This change suggests that the function should be called without acquiring the inode lock on the parent directory. Instead, it directly calls `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` to perform the lookup operation.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the check `if (tmp != dentry)`. This condition checks if the returned dentry `tmp` is different from the original dentry `dentry`. If they are different, it implies that the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. In this case, the patch simply releases the reference to the new dentry `tmp` and proceeds to the `out_reconnected` label, assuming that the dentry has already been reconnected.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific scenario where a dentry might have been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. By using `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`, the patch ensures that the correct dentry is looked up without acquiring the inode lock unnecessarily. The logic to handle the case of a renamed dentry seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the physical address information to the vm_struct for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch replaces NULL values returned by vc_vchi_audio_init(...) with error pointer values. This indicates that there was a bug causing NULL values to be returned, which could potentially lead to issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve replacing NULL values with error pointer values and updating the return values accordingly. This ensures that the patch focuses on fixing the actual bug rather than making trivial changes.

3. The patch improves error handling: By returning error pointer values (-EINVAL, -ENOMEM, -EPERM) instead of NULL, the patch provides more specific information about the cause of the error. This can help in diagnosing and resolving issues related to audio service initialization.

4. The patch includes proper error checking: The patch replaces the NULL check with IS_ERR(...) when calling vc_vchi_audio_init(...). This ensures that any error pointer values returned by vc_vchi_audio_init(...) are properly handled and appropriate actions are taken.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug, improves error handling, and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes unused code, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the way DRM_MINOR_* constants are defined. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "s390/vmur: Link parent CCW device during UR device creation." It suggests a modification in the code related to the creation of virtual unit record (UR) devices in the s390 architecture.

2. Patch Details: The patch modifies the code in the `ur_set_online` function in the `vmur.c` file. Specifically, it changes the `device_create` function call by adding the parent CCW device as the second argument (`&cdev->dev`).

3. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to address a specific issue related to the creation of UR devices in the s390 architecture. However, without further context or details about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem.

4. Criteria Evaluation: According to the criteria provided, the patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch should not contain any trivial fixes.

5. Decision: Given the limited information available, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Without understanding the specific bug or issue being addressed and its impact, it is difficult to assess the severity and criticality of the problem.

Therefore, the decision for this patch is inconclusive. Further analysis and information are required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch removes redundant code in the bnx2x_init_dev() function.
   - This indicates that the patch aims to improve code efficiency and remove unnecessary operations.

2. The redundant code being removed is related to setting the device power state to D0 and finding the power management capability.
   - The comment in the code suggests that Pci_enable_device() already sets the device power state to D0, making the redundant setting unnecessary.
   - The redundant code for finding the power management capability is also removed, as the pci core has already saved the value.

3. The patch includes Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is removing redundant code and improving code efficiency. It does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command in the Linux kernel. This option allows for explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. The patch also includes changes to the "perf" tool's documentation and related code files.

After analyzing the patch, I would classify it as a "trivial" fix. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it adds a new option to an existing command.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the dm_thin_find_block() function in the dm-thin-metadata.c file. The issue is that the ->fail_io flag is checked outside the metadata device's root_lock, which can lead to a race condition with the setting of this flag.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for the ->fail_io flag inside the root_lock section. If the flag is set, the function returns -EINVAL and releases the root_lock before returning.

This patch fixes a real issue that can potentially cause incorrect behavior or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Additionally, the patch has been signed-off by Joe Thornber and Mike Snitzer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers.

Hence, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "dp83640: Fix NOHZ local_softirq_pending 08 warning." It mentions that this fix is similar to a previous fix for the same warning. The patch replaces the usage of `netif_rx()` with `netif_rx_ni()` to be used from process/softirq context.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by Manfred Rudigier <manfred.rudigier@omicron.at> and David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net> (maintainer of drivers/net/phy/dp83640.c).

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes are made in the `rx_timestamp_work()` function. The line `netif_rx(skb);` is replaced with `netif_rx_ni(skb);`.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a warning related to NOHZ local_softirq_pending. It replaces a function call to ensure it is used from the correct context. However, without further context or information about the warning and its impact, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue being fixed.

   To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the impact of the warning and the potential consequences of not applying the patch. If the warning indicates a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if the warning is trivial or does not have a significant impact, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   Without additional information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add debug error messages to report command timeout in the liquidio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a timeout error message in the function `lio_process_ordered_list()` in the liquidio driver. This indicates that there might be a critical bug causing command timeouts, which can lead to unexpected behavior or system instability. This is a potential issue that could be considered for a stable release.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the function `if_cfg_callback()`. This provides additional information about the failure, which can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting. While it may not directly fix a critical bug, it enhances the error reporting and can be considered as an improvement.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant individuals.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential critical bug related to command timeouts and improves error reporting in the liquidio driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the redundant use of the of_match_ptr() function. This function is used to protect a data structure that is always compiled in, so it is not necessary in this case.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), and it is a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming variables and converting enums into defines. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the of_device_id arrays in three different drivers: mxc_w1.c, omap_hdq.c, and w1-gpio.c. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "drm/i915/skl: Allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP"
   - The patch aims to allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP in the i915 driver for the Skylake (SKL) platform.

2. Reviewed-by: Rodrigo Vivi <rodrigo.vivi@intel.com>
   - The patch has been reviewed by Rodrigo Vivi, an Intel employee who is likely familiar with the i915 driver and its impact.

3. Signed-off-by: Damien Lespiau <damien.lespiau@intel.com>
   - The patch has been signed off by Damien Lespiau, another Intel employee, indicating their approval and responsibility for the patch.

4. Signed-off-by: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>, drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_uncore.c
   - The patch has been signed off by Daniel Vetter, who is responsible for the i915 driver's intel_uncore.c file.

5. Code Change:
   - The patch modifies the whitelist[] array in the intel_uncore.c file.
   - Specifically, it changes the gen_bitmask value for the RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE) entry from GEN_RANGE(4, 8) to GEN_RANGE(4, 9).

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is a targeted fix for the i915 driver on the Skylake platform. It does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it seems to be a specific enhancement or adjustment related to the reg_read ioctl and the RCS_TIMESTAMP.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. As a result, my analysis suggests that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function called "nouveau_abi16" which is a locked variant of the existing "nouveau_abi16_get" function.
2. The existing "nouveau_abi16_get" function is modified to call the new "nouveau_abi16" function and return the "abi16" data if it exists.
3. The new "nouveau_abi16" function locks the client mutex, checks if the "abi16" data exists, and returns it if it does. If the "abi16" data doesn't exist, it allocates memory for it and initializes it.
4. The "nouveau_abi16_get" function is modified to lock the client mutex, call the new "nouveau_abi16" function, and return the "abi16" data if it exists. It also unlocks the mutex before returning.
5. The "nouveau_abi16_put" function is not modified in this patch.

Based on this analysis, the patch introduces a necessary locked variant of the "nouveau_abi16_get" function, which ensures proper synchronization when accessing the "abi16" data. This is important for preventing potential race conditions and ensuring data integrity. Therefore, it addresses a potential issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply replaces one function call with another, without any significant impact on the behavior or functionality of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it to be rejected for inclusion in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing helper function `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to the `crypto` module. This function returns the block size of an ahash algorithm.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the `fib_table_lookup` function in the `net/ipv4/fib_trie.c` file. It changes the calculation of the `mp` variable, which is used to determine the mismatch position in the prefix.

The patch replaces the existing calculation `int mp = KEYLENGTH - fls(pref_mismatch);` with `int mp = KEYLENGTH - __fls(pref_mismatch) - 1;`. The comment `fls(x) = __fls(x) + 1` suggests that `__fls()` is faster than `fls()` when the argument is known to be non-null.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It appears to fix a potential performance issue by using a faster function (`__fls()`) instead of `fls()` when the argument is known to be non-null. This change does not seem to be a trivial fix and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the missing `mutex_destroy()` function call when the driver is removed. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch description states that when the interface is down, the mailbox command to get context statistics fails. To address this issue, the patch restricts the driver from issuing the get statistics command when the interface is down.

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - Line 1412: Adds a line to set the linkup flag to 0 when the interface is down.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. It clears the link status when the interface is down, which prevents the driver from issuing the get statistics command and avoids potential failures.

   However, it is important to note that the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver's behavior when the interface is down.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases). While it addresses a specific issue, it does not fix a critical bug or a real security issue. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for inclusion in the next regular kernel release or for distribution-specific patches.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be necessary to make a final determination.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes socket specific code from l2cap_core.c. This change seems to be a code cleanup and does not fix any real or critical bug. Therefore, it can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be included in a stable release.

2. The patch moves the check for backlog size to l2cap_sock.c. This change seems to be a code refactoring and does not fix any real or critical bug. Similar to the previous change, it can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be included in a stable release.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch does not fix any real or critical bug and contains "trivial" fixes. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the function signature of `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change is made to prevent compiler errors when `CONFIG_REGULATOR` is not defined.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve deferring the building of the OSD request until just before submitting it in various callers. While this may improve code organization and readability, it does not address any specific bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the Gemini Lake platform to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake platform by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the intel_pstate_cpu_ids array.

2. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding support for a new platform, which is not considered a critical bug.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new advertising setting in the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch introduces a new flag, `HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE`, which allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, based on the information provided, it is difficult to ascertain the exact purpose and impact of this patch.

Without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is not possible to make an informed decision. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether this patch should be accepted or not.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch extends the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Olli Salonen and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `frequency_min` value in the `si2157_ops` structure from 110000000 to 55000000.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is extending the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. This change does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not address a critical issue. Hence, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the '0x' notation when using the %pad format. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a cosmetic change that removes an unnecessary '0x' from the printed string.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes forward declarations of the "struct super_block" in multiple files. These forward declarations are not used anywhere in the codebase, and removing them does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should be considered a trivial fix and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the patch should not be accepted (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills for the ARM64 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds missing L2 cache events for read/write accesses and misses, as well as DTLB refills. This indicates that there was a gap in the existing code, and this patch aims to fill that gap.

2. The patch is Acked-by Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com> and Signed-off-by Florian Fainelli <f.fainelli@gmail.com> and Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>. These are reputable individuals who have reviewed and approved the patch, which adds credibility to its validity.

3. The changes made in the patch are specific to the arm64 architecture, as indicated by the file path "arch/arm64/kernel/perf_event.c". This ensures that the patch only affects the relevant code for that architecture.

4. The changes made in the patch are related to performance monitoring unit (PMU) counters, which are crucial for performance analysis and optimization. Adding missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills will provide more accurate and comprehensive performance monitoring capabilities for ARM64 systems.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue by adding missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills, which are critical for accurate performance monitoring on ARM64 systems.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ext4 crypto: policies may only be set on directories". This suggests that the patch is related to the ext4 filesystem's encryption feature.

2. The patch adds a check to ensure that encryption policies can only be set on directories. This check is performed in the `ext4_process_policy` function.

3. The added check verifies if the inode is a directory (`S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode)`). If it is not a directory, the function returns `-EINVAL`, indicating an invalid argument.

4. The purpose of this check is to prevent encryption policies from being set on non-directory inodes, which would be incorrect behavior.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential issue where encryption policies could be set on non-directory inodes. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch is described as a cosmetic fix and is not actually used in practice.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the ARM mxc audmux-v2 driver. The patch adds the use of the generic clk framework API by replacing the clk_enable and clk_disable calls with clk_prepare_enable and clk_disable_unprepare calls.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a code improvement rather than fixing a critical bug.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   - The function is defined as static, suggesting it is only used within the net2280 driver.
   - The function is not called within the patch itself but is mentioned in the subsequent code block.

7. Usage of ep_clear_seqnum:
   - The function "ep_clear_seqnum" is called within the "net2280_enable" function if the device has a specific quirk (PLX_SUPERSPEED).
   - This suggests that the sequence number reset is only necessary for devices with this specific quirk.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the net2280 USB gadget driver. It introduces a new function to reset the sequence number for a specific endpoint when a certain quirk is present. The patch has been tested and signed off by multiple individuals.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply migrates the jazz driver to a new 'set-state' interface provided by the clockevents core, without providing any set-state callbacks.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and does not introduce any significant improvements or bug fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "rt2x00: rt2800pci: fix AUX_CTRL register setup for RT3090/3390/3593/5592". It aims to fix the AUX_CTRL register setup for specific chipsets (RT3090, RT3390, RT3593, RT5592) in the rt2800pci driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `rt2800pci_init_registers` function in the `rt2800pci.c` file. Specifically, it adds support for enabling PCIe wakeup for the mentioned chipsets.

   - The patch is finally signed off by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, indicating his final approval.

7. Code changes:
   - Line 295: The condition `if (i < O2CB_MAP_STABILIZE_COUNT)` is modified to `if (i < O2CB_MAP_STABILIZE_COUNT - 1)`.
   - The change ensures that the msleep() function is not called on the final loop iteration.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix an off-by-one error and avoids an unnecessary delay in the ocfs2 file system. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change seems to be a relatively trivial fix rather than addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by replacing "if (foo == false)" with "if (!foo)". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the function `freezable_schedule_timeout_killable()`. The patch correctly modifies the code to return the value from `schedule_timeout_killable()` instead of `freezer_count()`. 

The patch also mentions that all current callers ignore the return code, so the bug is considered harmless. However, it is still worth fixing.

Considering the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the ACPICA disassembler. The patch adds warnings for unresolved control methods, which can help identify cases where the disassembler is unable to determine the number of arguments to parse for method invocations.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect parsing of control methods, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for 1080p capture at 2 fps and 5 fps to webcam emulation in the vivid driver. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the driver.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Bluetooth management interface in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch description states that it fixes the return parameters for the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management interface. This indicates that it addresses a specific issue related to the command's response.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The patch also includes an "Acked-by" line from Marcel Holtmann, who is a recognized contributor to the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. This suggests that the patch has been reviewed and approved by an expert in the field.

4. Looking at the code changes, it appears that the patch modifies the "mgmt_start_discovery_failed" and "mgmt_discovering" functions in the "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" file.

5. In the "mgmt_start_discovery_failed" function, the patch adds a new variable "type" and modifies the "cmd_complete" function call to include the "type" parameter. This change ensures that the same address type passed to the Start Discovery command is returned in the response message.

6. In the "mgmt_discovering" function, the patch adds a new variable "type" and modifies the "cmd_complete" function call to include the "type" parameter. This change ensures that the same address type passed to the Start Discovery command is returned in the response message when stopping the discovery process.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management interface. It has been reviewed and approved by recognized contributors in the field. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unreachable code block. The removed code block contains a pr_debug() statement, which is a debugging statement that is typically only enabled in debug builds. 

Since the pr_debug() statement is never executed, removing it does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, this change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the code in any significant way.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. 

Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the given patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue where the "byPacketType" variable is not set at all in the vt6655 driver.
2. The patch adds a call to "CARDbyGetPktType" to set the "byPacketType" variable.
3. The patch also changes the function "CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate" to check the "basic_rates" variable instead of "wBasicRate".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue in the vt6655 driver related to the "byPacketType" variable not being set. This could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or functionality in the driver.

Considering that the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that further testing and review by the maintainers is necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch introduces a new helper function called `sk_stream_is_writeable()` which is used to replace a hardcoded condition in several call sites. The purpose of this change is to accommodate the upcoming support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will modify the condition for TCP sockets.

The patch itself does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue related to the condition check for writeability of a socket. By introducing the helper function, the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues like build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "aio: use cancel_delayed_work_sync()". This suggests that it aims to replace the usage of `cancel_delayed_work()` and `cancel_work_sync()` with `cancel_delayed_work_sync()` in the `fs/aio.c` file.

2. Looking at the code changes, the lines being modified are 211-212. The original code cancels the delayed work using `cancel_delayed_work()` and then cancels the work using `cancel_work_sync()`. The patch replaces these two calls with a single call to `cancel_delayed_work_sync()`.

3. The `cancel_delayed_work_sync()` function cancels a delayed work item and waits for it to complete before returning. This ensures that any pending work is properly canceled and avoids any potential race conditions.

4. The patch also includes a call to `aio_free_ring()` and sets `ctx->mm` to NULL after canceling the delayed work. These additional changes seem to be related to the specific implementation of the `kioctx` structure and are not directly related to the use of `cancel_delayed_work_sync()`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to canceling delayed work in the AIO (Asynchronous I/O) subsystem. While the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs or issues, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the code.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the code by using the appropriate function for canceling delayed work and ensures proper cancellation and synchronization.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the DRM/i915 driver. Additionally, there is a small refactoring for gen2 using the for_each_pipe macro. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. 

From the patch description and code changes, it does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. Instead, it appears to be adding functionality and making some minor code improvements. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch filters out no-op frontbuffer tracking flushes, which is not directly related to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Title: drm/amdgpu: prevent get_user_pages recursion
   - The patch title suggests that the patch aims to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages function in the amdgpu driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch adds a new structure `amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list` to keep track of tasks inside `get_user_pages`.
   - It adds a new member `guptasks` of type `struct list_head` to the `amdgpu_ttm_tt` structure.
   - It introduces a new spinlock `guptasklock` to protect the `guptasks` list.
   - In the `amdgpu_ttm_tt_pin_userptr` function, it adds the current task to the `guptasks` list before calling `get_user_pages`.
   - After calling `get_user_pages`, it removes the current task from the `guptasks` list.
   - In the `amdgpu_ttm_tt_affect_userptr` function, it checks if the current task is already in the `guptasks` list to prevent recursion.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific issue related to recursion in the `get_user_pages` function in the amdgpu driver.
   - It introduces a new mechanism to keep track of tasks inside `get_user_pages` and prevents recursion by checking if the current task is already in the `guptasks` list.
   - The patch does not seem to fix any critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.
   - It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than fixing a critical issue.
   - The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they introduce new data structures and modify existing functions.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While the patch may provide some benefits in terms of preventing recursion, it does not address a critical bug or issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicated "const" keyword in the pinctrl-imx.c file. This fix addresses a smatch warning about duplicate const.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply makes the functions __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() and __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_add() symmetric. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch modifies the `dw_mipi_dsi_dcs_short_write` function in the `dw-mipi-dsi.c` file of the Rockchip DRM driver.

2. The patch changes the type of `tx_buf` from `const u16*` to `const u8*`.

3. The patch introduces a new variable `data` of type `u16` and initializes it to 0.

4. The patch modifies the logic for encoding the endianness of the data in `tx_buf`. Instead of directly casting `tx_buf` to `u32`, the patch now checks the length of `tx_buf` and sets the appropriate bits in `data` accordingly.

5. The patch then uses `data` to generate the packet header value `val` by calling `GEN_HDATA` and `GEN_HTYPE` macros.

6. Finally, the patch calls the `dw_mipi_dsi_gen_pkt_hdr_write` function with the updated `val` value.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a potential out-of-bounds read issue on `tx_buf` and improves the endianness encoding. However, it does not fix any critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a Linux -stable release. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new variable `dev` of type `struct net_device *` to store the `skb->dev` value.
2. The patch replaces `skb->dev->ifindex` with `dev->ifindex` in the `__inet_lookup_established` function call.
3. The patch adds a check to ensure that the `rt->rt_iif` value matches `dev->ifindex` before setting the `skb_dst` and `err` values.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is validating the route interface in the early demux process to avoid violating reverse path filtering. It ensures that the `rt_iif` value matches the `ifindex` of the device before setting the `skb_dst` and `err` values.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to reverse path filtering, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes a static variable to 0. This is a common practice and does not fix any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses an issue related to the port offset for DMEM registers in the drm/nouveau/falcon driver. It modifies the code to fix the offset calculation for writing and reading data to/from the registers.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the original code had an incorrect offset calculation for the port. The patch corrects this by multiplying the port value by 8 instead of 16, which aligns with the stride of 8 bytes for the DMEM registers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses an issue related to register offset calculation.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a non-critical issue and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the value of GEN6_RP_DOWN_TIMEOUT from hexadecimal to decimal and reorders the register writes. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the fence number in DPFC_CTL on SNB (Sandy Bridge) architecture. The patch ensures that the fence number in DPFC_CTL is set to 0 on SNB, as explicitly stated in the documentation. This is necessary for proper GTT (Graphics Translation Table) tracking.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect behavior in the GTT tracking. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of a variable from `phys_t` to `phys_addr_t`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As per the criteria, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis would be (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to address a potential improvement in synchronization.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a NULL check for platform data in the ramoops_probe function. This check ensures that a driver does not incorrectly set up a probe request without defining the platform_data structure. This is a valid and necessary check to prevent potential issues.

2. The patch also includes an error message when the platform data is NULL, indicating that the platform data is missing. This helps in identifying and debugging any potential issues related to incorrect driver setup.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue related to missing platform data, which can lead to problems like build errors, oops, or data corruption.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior significantly. It only adds a necessary check for NULL platform data.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to missing platform data, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable in the staging driver for the wilc1000 wireless chip. The change does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is simply a renaming of a variable to adhere to naming conventions.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch switches the usage of the `iterate` field to `iterate_shared` in the `file_operations` structure for various file systems. This change eliminates the need to lock the directory in `dcache_dir_lseek()` and instead relies on per-struct file exclusion.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to directory locking, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect error message in the ext4_ext_insert_index function. This indicates that there was a bug in the code that caused the error message to display incorrect information.

2. The error message is related to the comparison between eh_entries and eh_max variables. The patch corrects the error message to display the actual values of eh_entries and eh_max, providing more accurate information to the user.

3. The error message is important for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. It helps identify situations where eh_entries exceeds eh_max, which could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or other unexpected behavior.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue that could impact the functionality and reliability of the ext4 filesystem.

Based on these points, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and correctness of the ext4 filesystem.
false || Based on the provided patch, which only adds spaces around the '>>' operator to fix a checkpatch issue, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves some deallocations from the `regulator_unregister` function to the `regulator_dev_release` function. This is done to utilize the class device lifetime management features more effectively.

2. In the `regulator_dev_release` function, the patch adds two deallocations:
   - `kfree(rdev->constraints)` frees the memory allocated for `rdev->constraints`.
   - `of_node_put(rdev->dev.of_node)` releases the reference to the device tree node.

3. In the `regulator_unregister` function, the patch removes the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and the release of the device tree node.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making changes to the deallocation process in the `regulator_dev_release` function and removing some deallocations from the `regulator_unregister` function.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for the of_device table in the palmas driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the rbd_header_from_disk() function in the rbd.c file.
2. The bug could potentially lead to an overflow if the snap_count value is too large.
3. The patch introduces a local variable "size" to store the calculated size, improving readability and shortening some lines.
4. The patch replaces the use of sizeof(type) with sizeof(object) in several places, ensuring the correct size is used.
5. The patch correctly checks for potential overflow before allocating memory for the header->snapc and header->snap_sizes variables.
6. The patch also correctly allocates memory for the header->object_prefix variable and copies the block_name value into it.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to memory corruption and improves code readability. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a warning message in the uvesafb driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros. These macros are described as "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscate the code." The patch also replaces the usage of these macros with direct access to the ndev->name field.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes section conflicts in mm/percpu.c, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue related to the organization of code sections in the percpu subsystem.

2. The patch is signed-off by Andi Kleen, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has undergone review and approval by experienced developers.

3. The change in the patch modifies the declaration of the `pcpu_fc_names` array in include/linux/percpu.h and mm/percpu.c.

4. In include/linux/percpu.h, the patch changes the declaration of `pcpu_fc_names` from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, making it a constant pointer to constant characters.

5. In mm/percpu.c, the patch changes the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata = {...};` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst = {...};`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, making it a constant pointer to constant characters, and also adds the `__initconst` attribute, indicating that the array is initialized during the initialization phase.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a trivial fix that adds the `const` qualifier and the `__initconst` attribute to the `pcpu_fc_names` array.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'driver' argument from the 'pxa27x_udc_stop' function in the 'pxa27x_udc.c' file. This change is made in preparation for future patches that will remove the 'driver' argument altogether.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the b43 N-PHY driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements reading support for radio 0x2057 and handles the different register values based on the device's PHY revision.

The patch includes a conditional statement that checks the PHY revision of the device. If the revision is greater than or equal to 7, the register value is ORed with 0x200 to enable reading support for radio 0x2057. Otherwise, for lower revisions, the register value is ORed with 0x100 to maintain compatibility with previous radios.

This patch addresses a specific issue related to radio reading support and does not contain any trivial fixes. It does not introduce any new risks or issues and is focused on improving functionality.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the format specifier used for printing a DMA address in the ti-vpe driver. The warning suggests that the format specifier '%x' expects an unsigned int argument, but the argument provided is of type 'dma_addr_t'.

The patch modifies the pr_debug statement at line 587 in the vpdma.c file to use the '%pad' format specifier instead of '%08x' for printing the start address of the vpdma_dtd structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a warning related to a format specifier mismatch.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the NFC (Near Field Communication) subsystem. The patch addresses the problem of the parent socket being freed before its children, which could lead to accessing invalid memory.

The patch unlinks the LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol) child sockets from the parent socket without trying to reach it through the parent. It first checks if the LLCP socket is the same as the one stored in the `local->sockets` array. If it is, the corresponding entry in the array is set to NULL. Otherwise, the LLCP socket is directly removed from the linked list using `list_del()`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue related to memory access and ensures the correct handling of LLCP child sockets.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the argument name of the host_int_add_ptk function declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix that addresses a potential issue with the number of reserved QPs (Queue Pairs) in the mlx4 driver. The patch adds a check to ensure that the number of reserved QPs is feasible and does not exceed the total number of QPs supported by the device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a preventative measure to avoid potential problems related to the number of reserved QPs.

Furthermore, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a new check and validation logic.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing check for the return value of sme_wait_for_reply function in the staging driver csr/sme_blocking.c. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that sets the `vblank_disable_allowed` flag to true in the `mtk_drm_kms_init` function of the `mtk_drm_drv.c` file.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific clock configuration issue on the i.MX6 Solo/DualLite platform. The patch modifies the clk-imx6q.c file to handle the different meaning of the CCM_CBCMR register between the i.MX6 Quad/Dual and the i.MX6 Solo/DualLite.

The patch adds a conditional statement to check if the CPU is i.MX6 DualLite and then redefines/reuses the multiplexer and divider of the imx6q clock gpu2d as mlb_sys_sel and mlb_sys_clk_podf for the mlb clock configuration. Otherwise, it uses the existing axi configuration.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a specific configuration adjustment for a particular platform.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the macro used in the code. The change is from using DPSIGN() to SPSIGN() in the ieee754sp_sub() function in the sp_sub.c file.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, since this patch only involves a macro change, it does not seem to fix any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a printk(KERN_ERR) statement with a dev_err() statement in the lis3l02dq_core.c file. This change is aimed at addressing checkpatch.pl issues related to the preferred usage of netdev_err(netdev, ..), dev_err(dev, ..), and pr_err(..) over printk(KERN_ERR).

Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As such, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for DCBX firmware commands in the mlx5 driver. The patch includes the addition of two functions, `mlx5_query_port_dcbx_param` and `mlx5_set_port_dcbx_param`, which allow querying and setting the DCBX parameters for a given port.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the provided patch does not provide any information about a bug or issue that it aims to fix. It seems to be adding functionality rather than addressing a specific problem.

Without further context or information about the significance of this functionality or any associated bug or issue, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based solely on the provided patch, it does not appear to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it does not fix a critical bug or address a significant issue.

Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "net/mlx5_core: Clear outbox of dealloc uar". It suggests clearing the outbox before executing the command.

2. Patch Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Majd Dibbiny, Eli Cohen, and David S. Miller.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `mlx5_cmd_free_uar` function in the `uar.c` file of the `mlx5_core` driver. Specifically, it adds a line to clear the `out` structure before executing the command.

4. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue related to deallocating the UAR (User Access Region) in the Mellanox ConnectX-4/5 Ethernet driver. By clearing the `out` structure before executing the command, it ensures that any previous data in the structure does not interfere with the deallocation process.

Considering the nature of the patch, it does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results. While this may not be a critical bug, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Given the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the reliability and correctness of the `mlx5_core` driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to enabling Tx power based on the BT status in the iwlwifi driver's BT Coex functionality. The patch modifies the condition for canceling reduced Tx power and disabling reports based on the BT status.

From the patch description and code changes, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the BT Coex functionality in the iwlwifi driver. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it could potentially lead to suboptimal behavior or performance degradation in certain scenarios.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue, it does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a non-trivial issue and improves the functionality of the iwlwifi driver's BT Coex feature.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a build issue in the brcmfmac driver when the CONFIG_BRCMDBG configuration option is not set. The build issue is caused by the undeclared BRCMF_FWS_TYPE_SEQ_LEN define.

The patch introduces the missing define in the source file, which was originally put in a conditional part of the code under #ifdef DEBUG. It also adds a comment explaining the purpose of the define.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real bug that causes a build error, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return type of the function `host_int_set_mac_chnl_num` from `s32` to `int`. The reason for this change is that `s32Error` is assigned the return value of the `wilc_mq_send` function, which has a return type of `int`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the netfilter xt_hashlimit module. The patch introduces a "_ALL" macro to validate if the set bits are within a valid range. This helps ensure that only known and supported flag bits are accepted.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an improvement or code cleanup rather than addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `addrconf_rs_timer` function in the `net/ipv6/addrconf.c` file.

2. The patch adds a new variable `dev` of type `struct net_device *` and assigns it the value of `idev->dev`.

3. The patch releases the write lock on `idev->lock` by calling `write_unlock(&idev->lock)`.

4. The patch then checks if it can retrieve the link-local address (`lladdr`) using the `ipv6_get_lladdr` function. If successful, it calls `ndisc_send_rs` with the retrieved link-local address and the `in6addr_linklocal_allrouters` address.

5. If the link-local address cannot be retrieved, the patch jumps to the `put` label, which releases the reference to `idev` by calling `in6_dev_put(idev)`.

6. Finally, the patch reacquires the write lock on `idev->lock` and updates the RS timer if necessary.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential deadlock issue caused by calling `ndisc_send_rs` with the write lock held. By releasing the write lock before calling `ndisc_send_rs`, the patch prevents the potential deadlock.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential deadlock issue, it can be classified as fixing a "real and critical bug" and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve switching the function `drbd_may_finish_epoch()` from using `mdev` to `tconn` as an argument.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro. The change itself does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces a new constant `PT_MAX_HUGEPAGE_LEVEL` in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h` and modifies several functions in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c`. 

The patch appears to be introducing a new feature related to handling different page sizes in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) MMU (Memory Management Unit). It adds support for a maximum huge page level, which is calculated based on the number of page sizes supported by KVM.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it seems to be more of an enhancement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a processor identifier for the M5150 processor in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or significant improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `uart_usp_ff_empty_mask` function in the `sirfsoc_uart.h` file.

2. The change is a correction to the calculation of the `empty_bit` variable.

3. Previously, the `empty_bit` was calculated as the base-2 logarithm of the `fifosize` variable.

4. The patch modifies the calculation by adding 1 to the result of the logarithm.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that corrects a calculation in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not address any of the mentioned issues explicitly.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes undesired spaces, lines, and tabs.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential ordering issue in the ECAM kernel implementation when using ioremap() to map the ECAM configuration space memory region. The patch suggests updating the ioremap() interface to use pci_remap_cfgspace() instead, which guarantees that non-posted write transactions are issued for memory writes within the ECAM memory mapped address region.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a potential ordering issue in the ECAM kernel implementation, which can impact software behavior.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, but it addresses a potential ordering issue that can impact software behavior. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, or data corruption, it can lead to unexpected behavior, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a significant change by replacing ioremap() with pci_remap_cfgspace().

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that can impact software behavior and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves message output by using pr_* instead of printk. This change is beneficial as it aligns with the preferred logging mechanism in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch adds a hexdump of ECC code if the test fails. This additional information can be helpful in diagnosing and debugging issues related to ECC errors.

3. The patch changes the log level for the hexdump of data from KERN_DEBUG to KERN_INFO. This change ensures that the hexdump is visible in the system logs, providing better visibility for debugging purposes.

4. The patch factors out the hexdump code into a separate function. This improves code readability and maintainability by separating the hexdump functionality into a dedicated function.

Overall, the changes introduced by the patch enhance the clarity and usefulness of the error messages and improve the debugging capabilities of the mtd_nandecctest driver. Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses real issues, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization for the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism to improve the average lookup time for memslots.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug, it does address an optimization issue that can improve performance in certain workloads. However, it does not fall under the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a return value to the function `kvmppc_core_check_requests` in the PowerPC architecture of the KVM module. The function previously had a void return type and has been changed to int return type.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is aimed at packing the `dst_cookie` field into the first cacheline hole for 64-bit hosts in the `struct sctp_transport`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a performance optimization to improve cache utilization.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release, I would recommend not accepting it. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to symbol versioning with symbol prefixes. The issue was introduced in a previous commit and caused problems with MODVERSIONS loading of modules using memcmp on x86_32 architecture. The patch suggests using __VMLINUX_SYMBOL_STR instead of VMLINUX_SYMBOL_STR to avoid unwanted expansion of the argument.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to symbol versioning, which may not fall under the category of critical bugs.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "intel_pipe_set_base" function of the "intel_display.c" file in the "drivers/gpu/drm/i915" directory. 

The patch introduces a conditional check using the "i915_fastboot" parameter. If the parameter is true, it updates the pipe size and adjusts the fitter accordingly. Specifically, if the "pch_pfit.size" is zero and the crtc has either INTEL_OUTPUT_LVDS or INTEL_OUTPUT_EDP type, it sets certain registers to zero.

Without further context or information about the purpose and impact of this change, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. As an AI, I cannot make a definitive decision without more information. 

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the rationale behind the change, the specific bug or issue it aims to address, and whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release (e.g., fixing a critical bug, addressing a security issue, etc.).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch adds better debugging for critical host errors in the xHCI (USB 3.0) host controller driver. It prints out the contents of the Transfer Request Block (TRB) and the event ring when certain error conditions occur.

2. The bug can cause issues: The patch specifically handles two error conditions - when a bad event TRB is encountered and when a transfer event is received for a disabled endpoint or incorrect stream ring. These errors can lead to data corruption or other issues in USB communication.

3. The patch provides useful information: By printing out the TRB contents and the event ring, users can get immediate information about what went wrong without having to recompile the kernel. This improves the debugging experience and helps in identifying the root cause of the issue.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The added code is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It adds significant functionality to improve debugging capabilities.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a real and critical bug, provides useful information for debugging, and does not contain trivial changes. Therefore, my recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing a pointless cast in the sha1_mb_mod_init() function in arch/x86/crypto/sha-mb/sha1_mb.c. The patch removes the unnecessary cast when allocating memory using kzalloc().

Additionally, it is important to consider whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "staging: rtl8192e: rtl8192e: rtl_core.c: Audit the return value of register_netdev()". This suggests that it aims to improve the error handling in the rtl8192e driver's probe routine.

2. The patch inspects the return value of the register_netdev() function call in the driver probe routine.

3. If the register_netdev() function call returns an error, the patch adds a check and returns -ENODEV.

4. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue in the rtl8192e driver by properly handling the return value of register_netdev(). This is not a trivial fix as it improves error handling and can prevent potential issues such as network device registration failures.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces two helper functions for accessing the ITS BASERn register. These functions, its_read_baser() and its_write_baser(), provide a convenient way to read and write the BASERn register.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds helper functions for register access, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel crash caused by a bogus dereference when the `app_id` is zero. This is a critical bug that can lead to system instability or crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward export of two functions, bdi_alloc_node() and bdi_put(), which are used by MTD (Memory Technology Devices) and need to be called directly. The patch also includes the necessary EXPORT_SYMBOL statements to make these functions available to other modules.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes the `q->bufs[vb->index]` variable correctly before calling `buf_init()`. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to resource release in the `mg_get_local_EKB` and `mg_get_ICV` functions in the `ms.c` file of the `rts5208` staging driver. The patch adds a jump to the appropriate label to ensure that resources are properly released before returning.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a resource release issue, which is not explicitly mentioned as a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes trailing commas in enum declarations. Trailing commas in enum declarations are not critical issues and do not cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the interrupt sources in the ARM mx53 platform. The patch updates the interrupt names from "RESV" to more meaningful names like "DAP", "RTC", "PTP", "MLB", "ASRC", etc. This change improves the clarity and readability of the code.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only updates the interrupt names, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only updates the version number in the dm-ioctl.h header file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch for the CIFS file system in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a warning raised by the Smatch tool regarding a cast to "int" in the min_t() function, which could potentially result in incorrect values being returned.

While this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does address a potential issue with the min_t() function. However, since this is a trivial fix related to type casting and does not address any critical issues, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, my analysis is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for loopback mode in the spi-imx driver for i.MX platforms. Loopback mode can be activated by setting the LBC (LoopBack Control) bit of the ECSPI_TESTREG register.

2. The patch defines the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG and MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC constants to be used in the code.

3. In the mx51_ecspi_config() function, the patch reads the current value of the ECSPI_TESTREG register and stores it in the 'reg' variable.

4. If the SPI_LOOP flag is set in the 'config->mode' field, the patch sets the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC bit in the 'reg' variable. Otherwise, it clears the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC bit.

5. Finally, the patch writes the modified 'reg' value back to the ECSPI_TESTREG register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds support for loopback mode in the spi-imx driver, which can be useful for testing and debugging purposes. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "nice to have" feature rather than a critical fix.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves replacing some functions with common extra gpio methods.

Additionally, the patch contains some commented-out code and a "FIXME" comment, indicating that it may not be a complete or final solution. It suggests that the functions being used should be replaced by correct gpio functions in the future.

Considering these factors, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and consolidation rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the multi-device fixup code from the `denali_init()` function to a new helper function called `denali_multidev_fixup()`. 

While this patch improves code organization and readability, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, it does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes macros and replaces them with direct register access. The changes do not fix any real and critical bugs, nor do they address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the "target_send_reply_msg" function static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple code refactoring to improve code organization.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the openvswitch module in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to use the flow hash during the flow lookup operation to detect hash collisions and avoid unnecessary flow key comparisons.

   - No, the patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style issue related to a line length exceeding 80 characters. This type of fix does not address a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes incorrect Probe Response offload support for Interworking in the ath6kl driver. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch adds a capability to flag a particular timer in the system as the system timer in the device tree source (DTS). This allows the DTS author to specify a specific timer to be used as the system timer. If the chosen node in the DTS contains a "system-timer=<&foo>" entry, then that handle will be used to determine the system timer. If no such entry exists, the first found timer will be used, which is the current behavior.

The patch modifies the `time_init()` function in the `arch/microblaze/kernel/timer.c` file. It first checks if the "system-timer" property exists in the chosen node of the device tree. If it does, it retrieves the timer node using the phandle specified in the property. If the property does not exist, it prints an informational message stating that no chosen timer was found and uses the default behavior. Finally, if no timer node is found, it falls back to using the compatible node "xlnx,xps-timer-1.00.a" as the timer.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It introduces a new capability that allows for more flexibility in specifying the system timer in the device tree. This can be useful in scenarios where a specific timer needs to be used as the system timer. The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to the system timer configuration.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve renaming functions and reorganizing the code structure for clarity. Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, without additional context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and the impact it has on the system, so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, which suggests replacing the use of `printk(KERN_ERR, ...)` with `pr_err(...)`, it appears to be a trivial fix related to logging. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock in the GFS2 file system.

2. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_data`, the patch adds a check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the gfs2_log_lock is not taken, and the function exits.

3. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_meta`, the patch also adds a check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the gfs2_log_lock is not taken, and the function exits.

4. Both functions then unlock the buffer_head.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock, which can improve performance but does not address a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the ipr driver in the Linux kernel. The patch increases the dump size in the ipr driver to 80MB, which is intended to help with debugging new SAS controllers. 

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue related to debugging new SAS controllers, it can be considered a valid fix for a potential "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch appears to be related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for Intel Skylake platforms. It introduces DMA resume capabilities to resume the DMA position when a stream is suspended or resumed.

The patch includes the following changes:
1. In the `skl_pcm_trigger` function, when the command is `SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_RESUME`, it prepares the substream and enables the DMA resume enable bit for the stream. It also sets the dpib and lpib positions to resume before starting the DMA.
2. In the `SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_SUSPEND` case, it saves the dpib and lpib positions, and then decouples the stream.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to DMA resume capabilities in the ASoC driver for Intel Skylake platforms. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the severity and impact of the bug being addressed, as well as any potential risks or regressions introduced by the patch. Additionally, it would be important to consider the feedback and review from other kernel developers and maintainers.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I cannot definitively determine whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. Further analysis and review are required.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the default value for available voltages in the mxcmmc driver during the mxcmci_probe function.

2. The issue occurs when available voltages are not provided, causing the mmc_regulator_get_supply() function to return 0.

3. If the return value is not an error code (-EPROBE_DEFER), the patch checks if mmc->ocr_avail is already set. If it is not set, it proceeds to set the default value.

4. The patch first checks if platform data (pdata) is available and if pdata->ocr_avail is set. If so, it assigns the value to mmc->ocr_avail.

5. If pdata is not available or pdata->ocr_avail is not set, the patch assigns the default value MMC_VDD_32_33 | MMC_VDD_33_34 to mmc->ocr_avail.

6. Finally, the patch continues with the rest of the mxcmci_probe function.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies a NULL comparison. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding SERDES initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 in the ath9k driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 in the ath9k driver. This suggests that it is fixing a specific issue related to the AR9462 2.1 hardware.

2. The patch modifies the `ar9003_hw_init_mode_regs` function in `ar9003_hw.c` to include the new initialization values for the `iniPcieSerdes` and `iniPcieSerdesLowPower` arrays.

3. It also adds a new header file `ar9462_2p1_initvals.h` which contains the actual initialization values for the `ar9462_2p1_pciephy_clkreq_disable_L1` array.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 hardware in the ath9k driver. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation of the patch by the Linux kernel maintainers or the relevant experts to determine if it addresses a real and critical bug, and if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

The patch modifies the i40e_acquire_nvm function in the i40e_nvm.c file of the i40e driver. The changes include adding more information to debug messages and modifying the logic for polling on the NVM semaphore.

The patch introduces additional debug messages to provide more information about the NVM acquire failure, including the type of acquisition, time left, return code, and AQ error. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

The main change in the patch is the modification of the polling logic for the NVM semaphore. Previously, the code would always poll until the current NVM owner timeouts. However, with the patch, the polling is only performed if there is time left on a previous reservation. This change aims to optimize the acquisition process by avoiding unnecessary polling when there is no time left.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses an issue related to NVM acquisition and improves the efficiency of the process. However, without further context or information about the severity of the issue and the impact it has on the system, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation and testing of the patch to assess its impact on system stability, performance, and security. Additionally, it would be beneficial to gather feedback from the community and experts in the i40e driver domain to ensure the patch is thoroughly reviewed before making a decision.

In conclusion, I would lean towards a cautious approach and suggest a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) until further evaluation and feedback are obtained.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds comments to the code and exports some clock IDs for PWM related clocks. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the "fw_func_mode" field in the lpfc_sli4_hba structure in the lpfc_sli4.h file. The patch changes the data type of the "fw_func_mode" field from uint8_t to uint32_t.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to the "fw_func_mode" field, which was defined too small to recognize dual-chute mode. This bug could potentially cause functional issues or incorrect behavior in the system.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch modifies the data type of a field, which is not considered a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to watchdog ping return errors being ignored by the watchdog core. The patch propagates the ping error code to the user space, ensuring that the watchdog daemon is informed about possible hardware errors or if the underlying device driver gets unregistered.

The patch includes changes to the `watchdog_write` and `watchdog_ioctl` functions in the `watchdog_dev.c` file. In both functions, the `watchdog_ping` function is called, and the return value is checked for errors. If an error occurs, the error code is returned.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch addresses a real issue related to error handling in the watchdog core. It ensures that errors are properly propagated to the user space, which is important for diagnosing and addressing potential hardware or driver issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to setting the number of submission and completion queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch changes the function `nvme_get_features` to `nvme_set_features` to correctly set the number of queues by calling the Set Features command instead of the Get Features command.

3. The `nvme_set_features` function is added, which sets the necessary parameters and submits an admin command to set the features.

4. In the `set_queue_count` function, the `nvme_get_features` call is replaced with `nvme_set_features` to correctly set the number of queues.

5. In the `nvme_dev_add` function, the `nvme_get_features` call is replaced with `nvme_set_features` to set the LBA range.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to setting the number of queues in the NVMe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses an issue that could potentially cause data corruption or other problems.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks certain functions as static in the `tfc_conf.c` file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only eliminates warnings related to missing prototypes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds two clocks for the mxc rtc driver on the imx35 platform. While this may be a necessary addition for the driver to function properly, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the mv88e6xxx_set_port_state function in the dsa/mv88e6xxx.c file. The patch ensures that the correct error code is returned if the _mv88e6xxx_reg_read function returns an error.

Since this patch addresses an error handling issue, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves cleaning up the usage of the hcpriv field in the octeon-usb staging driver. The changes involve using ep->hcpriv for the pipe handle and urb->hcpriv for the submit handle, instead of packing both into the same field.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the AMD IOMMU driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the function `dma_ops_free_addresses` in the `amd_iommu.c` file.

2. The change replaces the setting of `dom->need_flush` with a direct flush of the IOMMU TLB in the `dma_ops_free_addresses` function.

3. The condition `if (address + pages > range->next_bit)` checks if the address plus the number of pages exceeds the next bit in the range.

4. If the condition is true, the `domain_flush_tlb` and `domain_flush_complete` functions are called to flush the TLB of the IOMMU domain.

5. Finally, the `address` variable is updated.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to flushing the IOMMU TLB in the `dma_ops_free_addresses` function. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to consider the severity of the bug being fixed, whether it causes any critical issues like build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, without more information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker support for Asus AiO ZN270IE". It addresses an issue where the Asus AiO ZN270IE with ALC256 has no audio output for the internal speaker and headphone. The patch enables GPIO 2 as an amp and pulls it high.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by three individuals: Chris Chiu, Daniel Drake, and Takashi Iwai. This indicates that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the file "sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c" and adds a new fixup entry for the ALC256 codec on the Asus AiO ZN270IE.

4. Fixup Entry:
   The new fixup entry, ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2, is of type HDA_FIXUP_VERBS. It sets up GPIO2 for the speaker amp by sending a series of AC_VERB_SET_GPIO commands.

5. Quirk Entry:
   The patch also adds a new quirk entry, SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x1043, 0x3030, "ASUS ZN270IE", ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2), for the Asus ZN270IE model. This associates the quirk with the fixup entry defined earlier.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific hardware issue on the Asus AiO ZN270IE model by enabling and configuring GPIO2 as an amp for the speaker. Since it fixes a real and critical bug that affects audio output, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves code refactoring and consolidation. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of sscanf with kstrtoint. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch simply adds a missing call to platform_set_drvdata in the da9052_bat_probe function. This fix does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a log message if DP link training fails in the Nouveau display driver.

2. The change is made in the `nouveau_dp_train` function in the `dport.c` file.

3. The patch modifies the while loop condition from `while (link_bw[0])` to `while ((ret = -EIO) && link_bw[0])`. This change introduces a new variable `ret` and assigns the value `-EIO` to it. The loop will continue as long as `link_bw[0]` is not zero.

4. After the loop, if `ret` is less than zero, it logs an error message stating that link training failed.

5. The patch then proceeds to execute the post-train script from the vbios.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a real issue by logging an error message when DP link training fails. This can help in diagnosing and troubleshooting display-related problems. The change does not appear to be trivial and does not involve spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that checks the return value of the `nla_put_be32` function. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MC13783 RTC functionality on the MX31PDK board. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. 

In this case, the patch does not seem to address any of these critical issues. It is adding support for a specific hardware component, which is not considered a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any significant changes or fixes beyond enabling the use of the RTC.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) topology support in the Linux kernel. The patch adds support for the topology file of ABI (Application Binary Interface) version 4 and ensures backward compatibility.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is related to adding support for a specific ABI version in the ASoC topology.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a request for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) capabilities during target initialization in the ath6kl driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be adding a feature or functionality rather than addressing a critical bug.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a new variable "ret" and uses it to check the return value of a function call.

3. The patch does not explicitly mention any critical issues or problems that it aims to solve. It adds a request for P2P capabilities, but it does not provide any justification for why this request is necessary or what problem it solves.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to loading GVT in the Intel graphics driver (drm/i915). The patch updates the value of i915.enable_gvt to false if loading GVT fails, allowing userspace to easily detect the failure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new code block labeled "bail" which sets i915.enable_gvt to 0 and returns 0.
2. This code block is reached when loading GVT fails, as indicated by the "goto bail" statements in the error handling sections of the code.
3. By setting i915.enable_gvt to 0, the patch ensures that the value is updated if GVT fails to load.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue related to loading GVT and provides a clear indication to userspace when GVT fails to load.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue where regulatory events are processed before the wiphy (wireless PHY) is registered, which can cause problems.
2. The patch adds a new boolean variable "wiphy_registered" to the "struct ath6kl" in the core.h file. This variable will track whether the wiphy is registered or not.
3. In the ath6kl_cfg80211_init() function in cfg80211.c, the patch sets "ar->wiphy_registered" to true after the wiphy is registered.
4. In the ath6kl_cfg80211_cleanup() function in cfg80211.c, the patch sets "ar->wiphy_registered" to false before unregistering the wiphy.
5. In the ath6kl_wmi_regdomain_event() function in wmi.c, the patch adds a check for "wmi->parent_dev->wiphy_registered" before processing the regulatory event.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue where regulatory events are processed before the wiphy is registered. This could lead to incorrect handling of regulatory information. The patch ensures that the wiphy is registered before processing regulatory events.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds support for the vidioc_create_bufs operation in the blackfin/bfin_capture driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. 

However, the patch description does not provide any information about a bug or issue that this patch addresses. It simply states that it adds support for vidioc_create_bufs. 

Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch (B) until more information is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
The patch aims to make the saa7134 driver more V4L2 compliant by filtering audio modes that came from the tuner, keeping only MONO/STEREO in radio mode.

2. Code Changes:
The code change is made in the `radio_g_tuner` function in the `saa7134-video.c` file. Specifically, the line `t->audmode &= V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO | V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO;` filters the audio modes for the radio tuner.

3. Analysis:
The patch modifies the behavior of the saa7134 driver when handling audio modes for the radio tuner. It restricts the audio modes to only MONO and STEREO, discarding any other modes that might have been set by the tuner.

4. Impact:
The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a compliance issue related to V4L2 standards. While it may improve the driver's adherence to standards, it does not fix a critical bug or introduce any significant functional changes.

5. Triviality:
The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on modifying the behavior of the driver to comply with V4L2 standards.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization order of the hardware (HW) so that the interrupt is only requested after the HW is initialized. This can help prevent potential issues that may arise from requesting the interrupt before the HW is fully initialized. This change seems reasonable and can potentially address certain bugs or issues.

2. The patch replaces the use of `irq_of_parse_and_map` with `platform_get_irq`. This change suggests a switch to a more standardized and recommended method for obtaining the interrupt number. It is generally beneficial to use standardized functions and interfaces, as they are more likely to be maintained and supported in the long term.

3. The patch includes a reset of the SPI-HW block before registering the SPI master. This ensures that the hardware is in a known state before it is used. This is a good practice to prevent any potential issues caused by uninitialized or inconsistent hardware states.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address potential issues related to initialization order and interrupt handling. Considering that the changes are not trivial and can potentially improve the stability and reliability of the SPI driver, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization and cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch converts the usage of `wait_for(I915_READ(reg))` to `intel_wait_for_register()` in the `assert_chv_phy_status()` function.

While the patch does mention efficiency improvements and code size reduction, it does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under code optimization and cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that exports the `tegra_chip_id` variable. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the clock rates before timer initialization on the ARM-based shmobile armadillo800eva board. The patch ensures that the correct clock rate (24MHz) is used instead of the default rate (25MHz).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific configuration issue on a specific board.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a new function. The deprecated function "create_singlethread_workqueue" is replaced with "alloc_ordered_workqueue" with the flag "WQ_MEM_RECLAIM" set.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo and improves the creation of debugfs entries in the drm/sti driver. The patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function and resolves a sparse warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving a structure definition from one header file to another.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that encapsulates the boot vector code into a function for cpuidle. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it mainly involves code refactoring and does not address any critical issues. As per the given criteria, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch mainly adds a new member to the `struct intel_gmbus` and updates the usage of this member in a few places.

Since the patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, and it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `cx24123_pll_writereg()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a timeout for ramrod replies in the cnic driver for the bnx2x device.

2. The purpose of the timeout is to allow forward progress and chip reset in case the device encounters parity errors and stops DMAing replies.

3. The patch modifies the function `cnic_bnx2x_destroy_ramrod` to use `wait_event_timeout` instead of `wait_event` to introduce the timeout functionality.

4. The patch also modifies the function `cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy` to use `wait_event_timeout` instead of `wait_event` and adds handling for the timeout condition.

5. Additionally, the patch defines a constant `CNIC_RAMROD_TMO` with a value of `(HZ / 4)` in `cnic.h`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to the bnx2x device encountering parity errors and not DMAing replies. The addition of the timeout functionality allows for forward progress and chip reset in such scenarios.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption or device malfunction.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current code ignores the failure of devm_clk_get for the core clock and explicitly sets it to NULL. This can lead to issues when querying other remaining clocks.

2. The patch proposes a cleaner way of handling the clock dependency: Instead of setting the core_clk to NULL, it returns the failure when devm_clk_get fails for the core clock.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs and acknowledgments from relevant individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a critical bug and does not include any trivial changes, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix the response behavior of UP requests in the drm/dp/mst module. Currently, NACK (negative acknowledgment) is being sent as a response, which may confuse receivers. The patch suggests changing the response to ACK (acknowledgment) to ensure correct behavior.

2. Patch Justification: Although no actual issues have been reported with the current behavior, it is still important to respond to UP requests correctly. By changing the reply type from 1 (NACK) to 0 (ACK), the patch ensures that the response aligns with the expected behavior.

3. Patch Impact: The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue that could cause confusion for receivers of UP requests.

4. Patch Review: The patch has been reviewed by two individuals, Mykola Lysenko and Alex Deucher, who have provided their signed-off-by statements. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and is considered suitable for inclusion.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to memory allocation failure in the hpsa_get_device_id function in the hpsa.c file of the SCSI driver. The patch changes the return value from -1 to -ENOMEM when kzalloc fails to allocate memory.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to memory allocation failure, which can lead to potential issues such as crashes or data corruption.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the memory allocation failure can potentially cause data corruption or crashes, making it a critical issue.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific bug related to memory allocation.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" on the s390 architecture.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds additional information to the /proc/cpuinfo file.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of adding new features or enhancements rather than addressing a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch titled "ARM: shmobile: sh73a0: add FSI clock" adds support for the FSI clock in the sh73a0 platform. It includes changes to the clock-sh73a0.c file in the arch/arm/mach-shmobile directory.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it appears that a new clock entry for FSI (MSTP328) is added to the mstp_clks array. Additionally, a corresponding clock lookup entry is added to the lookups array.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issues. The patch seems to be adding support for the FSI clock, which suggests it may be a new feature or enhancement rather than a bug fix.

Since the patch does not address a critical bug or any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, real security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the appropriate decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to setting the EQ (interrupt) delay multiplier in the lpfc driver for Emulex Fibre Channel adapters. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a loop in the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup() function to configure the EQ delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function. This loop iterates over the EQs created, LPFC_MAX_EQ_DELAY at a time, and calls the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function to set the delay multiplier.

2. The lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function is modified to accept a uint32_t parameter instead of a uint16_t parameter for the startq value.

3. The lpfc_eq_create() function is modified to always set the delay multiplier (dmult) to 0, instead of calculating it based on the maximum interrupt per second (imax).

4. The lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function declaration in lpfc_sli4.h is also modified to accept a uint32_t parameter instead of a uint16_t parameter for the startq value.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to setting the EQ delay multiplier in the lpfc driver. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision (ACK or NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a small code modification in the tcp_input.c file. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch introduces a new helper function called `tcp_tsopt_ecr_before`. This helper function takes a `struct tcp_sock` pointer and a `u32` value as arguments and returns a boolean value. It checks if the received timestamp option (`saw_tstamp`) and the received timestamp echo reply (`rcv_tsecr`) are both present and if the received timestamp echo reply is before the given timestamp value.

The helper function is then used in the `tcp_packet_delayed` function to replace a portion of the existing code. Previously, the condition checked if the received timestamp option and the received timestamp echo reply were both present and if the received timestamp echo reply was before the retransmission timestamp. Now, it simply calls the `tcp_tsopt_ecr_before` helper function with the same arguments.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a small code refactoring by extracting a portion of the existing code into a helper function. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capabilities and structures for SR-IOV E-Switch in the mlx5 driver. However, the patch does not address any specific bug or critical issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for an existing problem.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing any significant issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the data type of the variable "times" from "unsigned int" to "int" in three different functions: qat_hal_check_ae_alive, qat_hal_init_esram, and qat_hal_clear_gpr.

2. In the qat_hal_check_ae_alive function, the condition for the loop termination is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This means that the loop will terminate when "times" becomes negative.

3. In the qat_hal_init_esram function, the condition for the loop termination is also changed from "!times" to "times < 0".

4. In the qat_hal_clear_gpr function, the condition for the loop termination is changed from "!times" to "times < 0".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a potential issue with the termination condition of the loops in these functions. The change in data type and termination condition ensures that the loop will terminate correctly when "times" becomes negative.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes a typo in a debug message, it does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only involves a spelling change.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that added a "drv_priv" pointer for driver use in the mac80211 module. The reason for the revert is that no driver has been found to need this functionality, and the desired functionality has been implemented in a different way.

Given that this patch is a revert and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any real and critical bug, it can be considered a trivial change. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "const" keyword from two declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Title: dmaengine: bcm2835: add dma_memcopy support to bcm2835-dma

   - It includes a check for an error condition in bcm2835_dma_create_cb_chain, which improves error handling.
   - The patch has been tested using dmatest for all enabled channels, indicating some level of verification.
   - The new function bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy prepares a DMA transfer for memory-to-memory copying, enhancing the functionality of the driver.
   - The dma_cap_set and od->ddev.directions updates ensure that the driver supports the necessary capabilities and directions for memory-to-memory copying.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, the patch appears to add a useful feature to the bcm2835-dma driver, improving its functionality and error handling. It also includes proper testing and updates to support memory-to-memory copying. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to a potentially uninitialized variable in the bcm2835_clock_choose_div_and_prate() function of the bcm2835 clock driver. 

The patch initializes the variable "best_rate" to 0, which resolves the warning reported by gcc. However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. 

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix as it only addresses a warning and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. 

Hence, my analysis is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new event buffer cache in the DWC3 USB driver. The purpose of this cache is to copy triggered events from the event buffer and process them later in the bottom half handler. The patch also includes memory allocation for the cache.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention fixing a bug. It appears to be implementing a workaround for a known erratum in recent DWC3 releases. Without further information about the erratum and its impact, it is difficult to determine if it qualifies as a real and critical bug fix.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not introduce any obvious issues that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It adds a new buffer cache and performs memory allocation for it.

Based on the analysis, it is not clear if the patch addresses a real and critical bug. However, it does not introduce any obvious issues and does not contain trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) unless further information about the erratum and its impact is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time in the armada_370_xp_msi_alloc function. This allows the MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI flag to be added to the msi_domain_info structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. This indicates that the patch addresses a power-saving issue, which can be considered important.

2. The patch mentions that AFTR mode support has already been implemented for other Exynos SoCs for a few years. This suggests that the patch is adding support for a feature that has been successfully implemented and tested on other platforms.

3. The differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC compared to Exynos4x12 SoCs are listed, including the use of different secure firmware calls, wakeup masks, and the need to set/clear the C2_STATE BOOT mode flag. These differences indicate that the patch is addressing specific hardware variations and ensuring compatibility with the Exynos3250 SoC.

4. The patch includes changes in the firmware.c, pm.c, regs-pmu.h, and smc.h files, which are relevant to power management and system control.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific power-saving issue for the Exynos3250 SoC and ensures compatibility with the hardware. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error in the MIPS ath79 platform. The error is caused by passing too many arguments to the `ap136_pci_init` function. The patch modifies the function declaration to include the expected argument, which is a `u8` pointer.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem. Additionally, the fix is considered trivial as it only involves adding a missing function argument. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to `pwm_apply_args()` after requesting the PWM device. The patch also includes a comment stating that `pwm_apply_args()` should be removed once the atomic PWM infrastructure is in place and the driver makes use of it.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and it is considered a trivial fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "ASoC: fsi: bugfix: ensure dma is terminated" and it aims to fix a bug related to FSI DMAEngine in the ASoC subsystem. The bug causes noise on playback if the DMA is not stopped correctly.

The patch itself adds a call to "dmaengine_terminate_all(io->chan)" to ensure that the DMA is terminated before starting or stopping the FSI stream. This ensures that any ongoing DMA transfers are properly terminated, preventing noise on playback.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause audio playback issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reclaim reboot state when the clientid is stale in NFSv4.0.
2. It adds the functionality to set NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED and reclaim reboot state for all v4.0 errors and recoverable errors on EXCHANGE_ID for v4.1.
3. It clears the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM bit and breaks the switch case for lease confirmation errors.
4. It clears the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM bit and calls the functions nfs4_state_clear_reclaim_reboot() and nfs4_state_start_reclaim_reboot() for stale clientid errors.
5. It handles the NFS4ERR_CLID_INUSE error by printing an error message.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to stale clientids in NFSv4.0. It introduces necessary changes to reclaim reboot state and handle errors appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function in the `ie6xx_wdt.c` file. The `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is currently annotated as `__devexit`, but it is being called from `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` as part of its error cleanup path.

The patch removes the `__devexit` annotation from both occurrences of `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()`. This change suggests that the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is no longer intended to be used exclusively for device removal.

However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the purpose and intended behavior of the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function, as well as the implications of removing the `__devexit` annotation. Additionally, it would be helpful to have information about any potential build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues that this patch aims to fix.

Without this additional information, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether this patch should be accepted or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `of_node_put` function call to decrement the reference count. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the `rapl_ids` array as `__initconst`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple optimization to release memory after initialization is done.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the "pending" flag in the command structure. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `set_page_private` and `page_private` with `set_freepage_migratetype` and `get_freepage_migratetype` respectively. This change aims to make the code clearer.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it is a trivial fix without any significant impact, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the debug module parameter from the cypress_m8.c USB serial driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is simply removing a parameter that is no longer used.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability by using defined macros instead of hard-coding values. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing break statements in the `ath5k_hw_set_spur_mitigation_filter` function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not address any significant functionality or performance improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code style cleanup in the rt2800lib.c file of the rt2x00 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a trivial fix that only involves code style changes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointless copy operation. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve performance.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused variables and corresponding lines. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). This is because it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch contains only trivial changes, such as removing unused variables and lines, which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function and replaces per_cpu_ptr() with this_cpu_ptr(). 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `hw_dbg` with `dev_info` for logging link up/down messages in the ixgbevf driver. This change improves the consistency of logging messages by using the appropriate logging function.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a minor code improvement that does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the mx51_clocks_init() function to a device tree (DT) call. This change is specific to the i.MX51 platform, which is becoming a DT-only platform. The mx51_clocks_init() function is modified to take a device_node pointer as an argument instead of individual clock rates.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devinitdata. This suggests that it is a cleanup change rather than fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply replaces the call to `platform_get_drvdata(pdev)` with the already available `dw` variable. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding clock definitions for the SYS-DMAC modules on the Renesas R8A7796 platform. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch introduces two new functions, `vm_entry_controls_reset_shadow` and `vm_exit_controls_reset_shadow`, which simply read the entry/exit control fields of the VMCS and store them in the respective shadow variables.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch for the mac80211 module in the Linux kernel. The patch removes a duplicate declaration of the function `ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work` in the `ieee80211_i.h` header file.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable from "pvRecvBuffer" to "recv_buf" in the wilc_mq_recv function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is simply a cosmetic change to improve code readability.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the "host-protection-interruption" feature in the KVM s390 virtualization module. The patch checks if the guest is allowed to use the ESOP (Extended Support for Opcodes) feature, and if so, it enables the host-protection-interruption by setting a bit in the scb_s->ecb field.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue.

From the information provided, it is not explicitly clear whether this patch addresses a bug, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancing an existing one. Without further context or information, it is difficult to determine if this patch qualifies as critical or necessary for a stable release.

Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Given the limited information available, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in a stable release (NAK) unless there is additional context or information that suggests it addresses a critical issue or bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the key initialization of tcp_fastopen cookies to use net_get_random_once instead of get_random_bytes.
   - This change ensures that if the user sets a custom key, net_get_random_once is called at least once to avoid overwriting the user-provided key when the first cookie is generated later on.

2. The patch adds a new function tcp_fastopen_init_key_once, which generates a dummy secret key but does not publish it.
   - This function is called in the proc_tcp_fastopen_key function to generate a dummy key and prevent regenerating a new key on the first invocation of tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen.

3. The patch modifies the tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen function to call tcp_fastopen_init_key_once before generating the cookie.
   - This ensures that the key is initialized before generating the cookie.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue with key initialization in tcp_fastopen cookies. It ensures that a custom key is not overwritten and that a dummy key is generated before generating the cookie. Although the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue related to key generation.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. This patch seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than fixing a critical bug or security issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch primarily replaces the usage of `serial->private` with `usb_get_serial_data(serial)` and `usb_set_serial_data(serial, data)`.

Since the patch does not address any critical issue and only involves minor code refactoring, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode for the OMAP platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch description states that the audio stack used omap_stop_dma/omap_start_dma to pause/resume the DMA, which has been used for years on OMAP based products. This suggests that the patch addresses an existing functionality used in production systems.

2. The patch modifies the omap_chan structure by adding a new boolean field called "paused." This field will be used to track whether the DMA channel is currently paused or not.

3. In the omap_dma_terminate_all function, the patch adds a check to avoid stopping the DMA twice if it has already been paused. This ensures that the DMA is only stopped once when terminating all ongoing transfers.

4. In the omap_dma_pause function, the patch adds support for pausing the DMA channel. It checks if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode and if it is not already paused. If these conditions are met, it stops the DMA channel and sets the "paused" flag to true.

5. In the omap_dma_resume function, the patch adds support for resuming the DMA channel. It checks if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode and if it is currently paused. If these conditions are met, it starts the DMA channel and sets the "paused" flag to false.

6. The patch does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It addresses a specific functionality requirement for the OMAP platform.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode, which is used by the audio stack on OMAP based products. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to address a real and critical issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential buffer overflow issue in the mei_cl_device_match() function in the drivers/misc/mei/bus.c file. The original code uses strcmp() to compare the device name, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the device name is longer than the buffer size. The patch replaces strcmp() with strncmp() to ensure that the comparison does not exceed the buffer size.

2. The patch also updates the strncpy() function call in the mei_cl_device_probe() function to use sizeof(id.name) instead of a fixed buffer size (MEI_CL_NAME_SIZE). This change ensures that the entire device name is copied, including the null terminator, and avoids potential buffer overflows.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

4. The patch has been signed-off by the original author Tomas Winkler <tomas.winkler@intel.com> and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>, who is a well-known Linux kernel developer.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential buffer overflow issue and improves the safety and correctness of the code. It meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or security issues.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - disable RRC by default." It suggests disabling the RRC (Radio Resource Control) feature by default in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices.

2. The patch checks if the firmware advertises support for the BT Coex RRC feature. If the firmware supports it, the feature will be enabled; otherwise, it will remain disabled.

3. The patch modifies the "enum iwl_ucode_tlv_capa" enumeration in the iwl-fw-file.h header file to include a new capability flag, "IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_BT_COEX_RRC," indicating support for BT Coex RRC.

4. The patch updates the "iwl_send_bt_init_conf_old" function in the coex_legacy.c file to use the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function to check if BT Coex RRC is supported by the firmware. If supported, the BT_COEX_RRC flag will be set in the bt_cmd->flags field.

5. The patch adds the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function to the mvm.h header file. This function checks if the BT Coex RRC capability flag is set in the firmware's ucode_capa structure and if the IWL_MVM_BT_COEX_RRC flag is set.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new feature to enable or disable the BT Coex RRC functionality based on firmware support. It does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the blk-mq subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch correctly frees the hctx->ctx_map inside the blk_mq_free_queue() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding JPEG register definitions for the CODA7541 media platform driver. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is adding register definitions, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Lustre staging driver in the Linux kernel. The patch updates the function signature of the `lnet_ping()` function to properly mark the `ids` parameter as a userspace pointer using the `__user` annotation.

The change in the function signature ensures that the kernel properly handles userspace pointers, which can help prevent potential security vulnerabilities or data corruption issues. Additionally, the patch mentions that it also resolves sparse warnings about different address spaces, which further indicates that it addresses a potential issue.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to security issues or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver for Qualcomm Atheros wireless devices. The patch adds two new event handlers, "wmi_evt_linkup" and "wmi_evt_linkdown", which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively.

The "wmi_evt_linkup" function is called when a linkup event is received from the firmware. It turns on the carrier for the network device associated with the wil6210 driver. This indicates that the data path is ready and the link is up.

The "wmi_evt_linkdown" function is called when a linkdown event is received from the firmware. It turns off the carrier for the network device associated with the wil6210 driver. This indicates that the link is down.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to handling linkup/linkdown events in the wil6210 driver. It ensures that the network device's carrier state is correctly updated based on the link status reported by the firmware.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to linkup/linkdown events in the wil6210 driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch addresses an issue where an unlock is missing on an error path in the `ieee80211_ibss_join()` function in the `ibss.c` file of the `mac80211` module.

The patch adds the missing `mutex_unlock(&sdata->u.ibss.mtx)` statement before returning `-EINVAL` in case of an error. This ensures that the mutex is always unlocked before exiting the function, preventing potential deadlocks or other issues.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to issues like hangs or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the `def_qos_parameters` structure in the `rtl8192u` driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." mentioned in the initial requirements. As per the requirements, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a naming collision of the variable "nr_irqs" in the file "irq.c" of the OMAP2+ ARM architecture.
2. The variable "nr_irqs" is renamed to "nr_irq" to avoid the naming collision.
3. The patch also updates the usage of the renamed variable in the "omap_intc_of_init" function.
4. Another occurrence of the variable "nr_irqs" is found in the file "prm_common.c" of the OMAP2+ ARM architecture.
5. The variable "nr_irqs" is renamed to "nr_irq" in the "omap_prcm_irq_handler" function.
6. The patch updates the usage of the renamed variable in the "omap_prcm_irq_handler" function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a naming collision issue in the OMAP2+ ARM architecture. However, this issue does not fall under the criteria of a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are considered trivial, as they involve renaming variables to avoid naming collisions.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing forward declarations of structures in cpuidle.h. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a memory leak issue when handling device tree (dt) maps in the MediaTek pinctrl driver.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers.

3. The patch modifies the "mtk_pctrl_dt_subnode_to_map" function in the "pinctrl-mtk-common.c" file.

4. The patch adds error handling for the "pinconf_generic_parse_dt_config" function call. If an error occurs, the function returns the error code.

5. The patch checks if the number of pins or maps per pin is zero. If either of them is zero, it sets the "err" variable to -EINVAL and jumps to the "exit" label.

6. The patch calculates the number of reserved maps based on the number of pins and maps per pin.

7. The patch calls the "pinctrl_utils_reserve_map" function to reserve the required number of maps. If an error occurs, it sets the "err" variable to the error code and jumps to the "exit" label.

8. The patch iterates over each pin and reads the pinmux property from the device tree. If an error occurs, it sets the "err" variable to the error code and jumps to the "exit" label.

9. The patch finds the pin group corresponding to the pin and checks if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it sets the "err" variable to -EINVAL and jumps to the "exit" label.

10. The patch calls the "mtk_pctrl_dt_node_to_map_func" function to map the pin, function, and group to the "map" structure. If an error occurs, it sets the "err" variable to the error code and jumps to the "exit" label.

11. If the "has_config" flag is set, the patch calls the "pinctrl_utils_add_map_configs" function to add map configurations for the pin group. If an error occurs, it sets the "err" variable to the error code and jumps to the "exit" label.

12. Finally, the patch frees the "configs" variable using "kfree" and returns the value of the "err" variable.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug related to memory leaks in the MediaTek pinctrl driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the gpio-ml-ioh driver. The patch modifies the ioh_gpio_get() function to ensure that the return value is clamped to [0,1] by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding entries in the HID table and referencing the "bytcht_da7213" driver in the ASoC Intel Atom machine driver. 

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the socket argument in the tcp_create_openreq_child() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant functional changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch modifies the code in drivers/acpi/osl.c.
2. It adds a seemingly useless check that was added in a previous commit to avoid false positive lockdep complaints.
3. The patch documents the purpose of the check and rearranges the related code to make fewer checks.
4. It replaces the kmalloc function with kzalloc to allocate memory for the acpi_os_dpc structure.
5. It determines the appropriate workqueue based on the conditions and initializes the work structure accordingly.
6. The patch also includes a comment explaining the need for different static lockdep keys for each workqueue.
7. Finally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to lockdep complaints and improves the code's readability. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only moves the initialization of the 'status' variable within the function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any functional or performance improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a platform device registration for the HDMI audio codec on OMAP4 Pandaboard and PandaboardES boards. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the provided patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding support for HDMI audio transmission on the mentioned boards. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the specified issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not appear to meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing any specified issues.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where all SDIO settings return to default when power is removed from the device. It proposes to reconfigure the settings after power is reapplied.

2. Impact: This issue can potentially lead to data corruption or functional problems if the SDIO settings are not properly reconfigured after power is restored.

3. Patch Changes: The patch adds a new function `ath6kl_sdio_config` and calls it in the `ath6kl_sdio_power_on` function. The `ath6kl_sdio_config` function is responsible for reconfiguring the SDIO settings.

4. Patch Review: The patch has been reviewed by James Minor and Steve deRosier, who have provided their signed-off-by statements, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to SDIO settings not being properly reconfigured after power is reapplied. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has been reviewed by relevant individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a test for an impossible condition. The condition being removed is "tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID". 

Since the condition is impossible, removing it does not fix a real and critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs. The patch adds compatibility checks for several R-Car SoC models, including r8a7792, r8a7793, and r8a7794. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch addresses any specific bug or issue. It seems to be adding support for PM runtime on specific R-Car SoC models. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further analysis and clarification from the patch submitter or the Linux kernel maintainers to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value from 0 to NULL in the host1x_bo_lookup() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "HID: wiimote: replace hid_output_raw_report with hid_hw_output_report for output requests." This suggests that it aims to replace a specific function call with another function call for output requests in the HID wiimote driver.

2. The patch provides an explanation that the new function call, hid_hw_output_report, is equivalent to the old function call, hid_output_raw_report, for the BT transport layer.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

4. The code changes in the patch involve replacing the old function call with the new one:

   - The condition `if (!hdev->hid_output_raw_report)` is replaced with `if (!hdev->ll_driver->output_report)`.
   - The function call `hid_output_raw_report(hdev, buf, count, HID_OUTPUT_REPORT)` is replaced with `hid_hw_output_report(hdev, buf, count)`.

5. The patch also includes memory allocation and deallocation operations for the buffer.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch appears to be a non-trivial fix that replaces an old function call with a new one, which is equivalent for the BT transport layer. It does not seem to introduce any new issues and should improve the stability and functionality of the HID wiimote driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and related code that sets and uses it. This change indicates that the frequency of the I2C bus clock will no longer be stored and used in the driver.

2. The patch introduces a new parameter "freq" in the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function, which is used to calculate the clock divider. This parameter will be passed from the "meson_i2c_probe" function.

3. In the "meson_i2c_probe" function, the "clock-frequency" property is read from the device tree node. If the property is not found, the "DEFAULT_FREQ" value is used.

4. After setting up the necessary data structures and resources, the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is called with the "freq" parameter to set the clock divider.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is removing the unnecessary storage and usage of the "frequency" member in the driver and instead directly sets the clock divider in the "meson_i2c_probe" function. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It appears to be a trivial optimization to avoid storing and using the "frequency" member.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as containing a "trivial" fix and recommend it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the log level of error messages to debug messages. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the visibility of the "pseudo_primary" variable in the scsi_debug.c file from non-static to static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing an unnecessary check before calling the `vfree()` function in the `asihpi_adapter_remove()` function in the `hpioctl.c` file of the ALSA asihpi driver. The patch claims that the `vfree()` function already performs input parameter validation, making the test around the call unnecessary.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - It is not explicitly mentioned whether this change fixes a bug. However, it seems to be a code improvement rather than fixing a specific bug.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not address any of these issues directly. It appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a critical issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` to the file `smilsub.c` and removing the unnecessary declaration in `smilmain.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. The patch sets the appropriate exit reason and suberror codes when instruction emulation fails, allowing for better error reporting to userspace.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to error reporting and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the IPv6 raw socket implementation. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch changes the function signature of `rawv6_send_hdrinc` to include a `struct msghdr *msg` parameter instead of `void *from`. This change allows the function to directly access the `msg` structure, which contains the necessary information for sending the IPv6 header.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `from` with `msg->msg_iter.iov` in the `memcpy_fromiovecend` call. This change ensures that the IPv6 header is copied correctly from the `msg` structure.

3. In the `rawv6_sendmsg` function, the patch replaces the casting of `msg->msg_iter.iov` to `(struct iovec *)` with passing `msg` directly to `rawv6_send_hdrinc`. This change simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary casting.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real bug in the IPv6 raw socket implementation and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the failure logging into the function `isl29028_set_als_scale()`. This reduces the overall amount of code in the driver.

2. The patch adds a new variable `ret` to store the return value of `regmap_update_bits()`.

3. The patch calls `regmap_update_bits()` to update the ALS range bits in the configuration register. If this operation fails (returns a negative value), it logs an error message using `dev_err()` and returns the error code.

4. The patch updates the `chip->lux_scale` variable with the new `lux_scale` value.

5. The patch returns the value of `ret`, which is the return value of `regmap_update_bits()`.

6. In the function `isl29028_write_raw()`, the patch removes the previous call to `isl29028_set_als_scale()` and the associated error logging. Instead, it directly calls `isl29028_set_als_scale()` and updates `chip->lux_scale` with the new `val` value.

7. In the function `isl29028_chip_init_and_power_on()`, the patch removes the previous call to `isl29028_set_als_scale()` and the associated error logging. Instead, it directly calls `isl29028_set_als_scale()` and returns its return value.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code refactoring to reduce duplication and improve code organization. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a spelling mistake in two files: zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c. The change replaces "reseting" with "resetting" in two warning messages.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only initializes the ".n_bitrates" field to the size of the "mwifiex_rates" array using the ARRAY_SIZE macro, instead of hardcoding the value as 14.

Since this patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility on the s390 architecture. This facility is being detected by setting the "has_ibs" flag in the "sclp_info" structure.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug?

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` which checks the readiness of the device. This function is necessary for proper device operation and can be considered a non-trivial fix.

2. The patch also sets the `dev_ready` function pointer of the `nand_chip` structure to `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready`. This ensures that the correct function is called when checking device readiness.

3. Additionally, the patch sets the `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure to 50. This value represents the delay in microseconds between chip operations and is necessary for proper device operation.

4. The patch modifies the `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_init` function to assign the `dev_ready` function pointer and `chip_delay` value to the `nand_chip` structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to device readiness and sets the necessary parameters for proper device operation. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch simply adds a comment and sets the `scanmask` value to `0xffff` in order to support NEC remotes with 24 or 32 bits. This does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the firmware image filename for the xc4000 tuner. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it is a cosmetic change to provide a more meaningful filename for public release.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "tty: serial: Fix termios/port flags mismatch" and is signed-off by Peter Hurley and Greg Kroah-Hartman. It appears to address a mismatch issue related to termios and port flags in the serial driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `uart_change_speed` function in `serial_core.c` file. It adds a call to `uport->ops->set_termios` before setting the flags based on the termios cflag. Additionally, it reloads the cflag from termios after calling `uart_change_speed` function.

3. Analysis:
   The patch aims to fix a potential mismatch between termios settings and port flags in the serial driver. By calling `uport->ops->set_termios` before setting the flags, it ensures that the termios settings are properly applied before modifying the flags. Reloading the cflag from termios after calling `uart_change_speed` function ensures that any changes made by the port driver are taken into account.

4. Decision:
   Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue related to termios/port flags mismatch in the serial driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and addresses a real bug that could potentially cause issues with the serial communication. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing may be required before finalizing the decision.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be fixing a specific issue related to handling ECC errors during the scanning of bad block markers in the MTD NAND driver. The patch introduces a change to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses the handling of ECC errors during the scanning of bad block markers, which can impact the reliability and functionality of the MTD NAND driver.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the bus watcher from a deprecated __initcall to a device_initcall. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content and purpose.

The patch appears to be related to the mlx5 driver for Mellanox network adapters. It introduces a new function called `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` which allows setting the minimum inline header mode for virtual functions (VFs) on the physical function (PF) side.

The function takes the mlx5_core_dev structure, the virtual port (vport) number, and the minimum inline value as parameters. It then constructs a modify_nic_vport_context_in structure and sets the necessary fields to modify the minimum_wqe_inline_mode value. Finally, it calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` to apply the changes.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or a security issue. The patch does not explicitly mention any specific issue or bug that it fixes. Without further context or information, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further investigation and additional information are required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the interaction between freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature in Btrfs. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a fix for the issue where the auto defragmentation feature continues to run even when the file system is frozen. This is a potential problem because freezing the file system implies that no background operations should be running.

2. The patch modifies the __btrfs_run_defrag_inode() function in the fs/btrfs/file.c file.

3. It initializes a range structure and sets its length to the maximum value and the start offset to the last offset used for defragmentation.

4. The patch then calls sb_start_write() to acquire a write lock on the superblock associated with the file system.

5. After acquiring the write lock, it calls btrfs_defrag_file() to perform the defragmentation operation on the given inode within the specified range.

6. Finally, the patch calls sb_end_write() to release the write lock on the superblock.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature. It ensures that the auto defragmentation does not run when the file system is frozen. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it modifies the behavior of the defragmentation process based on the file system's frozen state.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems when the file system is frozen.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the ternary operators using a GNU extension. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: adau17x1: Cleanup manual bias level transitions." It suggests cleaning up the manual bias level transitions in the ASoC driver for the adau17x1 codec.

2. The patch sets the CODEC driver's suspend_bias_off flag instead of manually transitioning to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in suspend and SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in resume. This change aims to make the code shorter and cleaner.

3. The patch modifies the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures by removing the suspend field and adding the suspend_bias_off field, which is set to true.

4. The patch removes the adau17x1_suspend function from adau17x1.c.

5. The patch modifies the adau17x1_resume function in adau17x1.c by removing the call to set_bias_level with SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY.

6. The patch removes the suspend field from the adau17x1_codec_driver structure in adau17x1.c.

7. The patch removes the adau17x1_suspend function declaration from adau17x1.h.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is primarily focused on code cleanup and simplification. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be trivial in nature, involving code removal and restructuring rather than addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" and ".bus" fields from the b53_spi_driver structure. These fields are set automatically by the module_spi_driver() function. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the format string specifier for size_t variables in the HID cp2112 driver. The change replaces the use of "%d" with "%zd" in two debug print statements.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "drm/nva3/fb/ram" file of the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is signed-off by Roy Spliet and Ben Skeggs, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

2. The changes in the patch are focused on the initialization of certain registers in the "nva3_ram_ctor" function.

3. The lines modified are 405-411, where three register assignments are changed from direct register values to using the "ramfuc_stride" function with a stride of 4 and the "ram->base.part_mask" parameter.

4. The modified registers are 0x100760, 0x1007a0, and 0x1110e0.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a modification aimed at improving the code by using the "ramfuc_stride" function.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event` in the ASoC twl6040 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch is titled "ASoC: max98090: read micbias from device property."
   - It mentions that the patch reads max98090 micbias from ACPI or DT.

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Fang, Yang A <yang.a.fang@intel.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>.
   - Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/max98090.txt is also mentioned as a sign-off.

3. Changes in the Patch:
   - The patch adds a new optional property called "maxim,micbias" to the device.
   - The property defines valid voltage values for the analog mic.
   - The valid voltages are 2.2v, 2.55v, 2.4v, and 2.8v.

4. Code Changes:
   - In the max98090_probe() function, the patch adds code to read the "maxim,micbias" property using device_property_read_u32().
   - If the property is not found, it sets the micbias to the default value of 2.8v and prints a dev_info message.
   - If the property is found but the value is out of the valid range, it sets the micbias to the default value of 2.8v and prints a dev_err message.
   - Finally, it updates the micbias value using snd_soc_update_bits().

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to reading the micbias property for the max98090 codec. It ensures that the micbias value is within the valid range and sets the default value if necessary. This fix does not seem to be a trivial change, as it adds functionality to read a device property and handle different voltage values.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit in the refactoring of simple_hdmi*() functions. The patch corrects the assignment of the pin NID, which was not assigned correctly before.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a regression and corrects a pin NID assignment.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers for the s390 architecture. The "owner" field is used to keep track of the module that "owns" the driver, but in this case, it is not necessary as the driver core will populate it automatically.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture. The warning indicates a mismatch between the function leon_callin() and the function leon_configure_cache_smp() in terms of their initialization attributes.

Since this patch addresses a section mismatch warning and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to replace the `pr_info` call with `pr_debug` in the `ion_chunk_heap_create` function in the `ion_chunk_heap.c` file. This change modifies the log level from `info` to `debug` when printing the heap creation details.

Since this patch only modifies the log level and does not fix any real or critical bug, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to define the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds definitions for the contiguous bit.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to mark the function `resiliency_test()` as `__init`, indicating that it should be placed in the `init.text` section and freed after boot. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code optimization or cleanup change, as it only affects the placement of the `resiliency_test()` function in memory.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch addresses a specific functionality: The patch adds support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. This indicates that it is intended to fix a specific issue related to SFP insertion.

2. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers: The patch is signed-off by Mark Rustad, Phil Schmitt, and Jeff Kirsher. This indicates that it has undergone review and approval by the relevant developers.

3. The patch modifies the ixgbe_irq_enable function: The patch adds a condition to enable the SFP insertion interrupt for the X550EM_X_SFP device. This suggests that the patch is introducing a necessary change to enable the desired functionality.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to SFP insertion on X550EM devices and has undergone review and approval. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant NULL check and a check for DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value in the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes an issue related to initializing the correct nvm channel list for 8000 devices in the iwlwifi driver.

2. The patch includes changes in the iwl-nvm-parse.c, iwl-nvm-parse.h, and mac80211.c files.

3. The change in iwl-nvm-parse.c updates the nvm_chan variable to use different channel lists based on the device family. This change ensures that the regulatory data contains the correct channels for 8000 series devices.

4. The change in iwl-nvm-parse.h updates the function prototype of iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info to include the struct iwl_cfg parameter. This change allows the function to access the device family information.

5. The change in mac80211.c updates the function call to iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info to pass the struct iwl_cfg parameter. This change ensures that the correct channel list is used when retrieving the regulatory domain.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a specific issue related to initializing the correct nvm channel list for 8000 devices in the iwlwifi driver. This issue could potentially lead to incorrect regulatory data, which can have implications for wireless communication.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and potentially impact the functionality of the affected devices, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch updates the code related to hotplug irq migration in the metag architecture.

2. The patch replaces the custom implementation of setting the IRQ affinity with the standard function `irq_set_affinity()`.

3. The patch also updates the loop that migrates IRQs to use the `for_each_active_irq()` macro instead of iterating over all IRQ descriptors.

4. The `route_irq()` function, which was previously used to set the IRQ affinity, is removed as it is no longer needed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a clean and straightforward improvement to the code. It replaces custom code with a standard function and simplifies the IRQ migration loop. However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of code cleanup and optimization rather than addressing a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the `imp_known_replied_xid` when trying to resend an already replied replay request. This is done because the xid of this replay request could be less than the current `imp_known_replied_xid`.

2. The patch is signed-off by Niu Yawei <yawei.niu@intel.com> and reviewed by Alex Zhuravlev <alexey.zhuravlev@intel.com> and Fan Yong <fan.yong@intel.com>.

3. The patch is also signed-off by Oleg Drokin <green@linuxhacker.ru> and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>.

4. The patch modifies the `ptlrpc_replay_next` function in the `drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/ptlrpc/recover.c` file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to resending replay requests and updating the `imp_known_replied_xid` accordingly. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to review the bug report associated with the patch (Intel-bug-id: https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/browse/LU-8645) and the discussion on the review link (http://review.whamcloud.com/22776). This would provide more details about the bug, its impact, and the necessity of the patch.

Therefore, based on the available information, I cannot make a definitive decision (ACK or NAK) regarding the acceptance of this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds module alias autogeneration for AMBA drivers in the nomadik-rng.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant functionality or improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes a trivial typo in a comment, it does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary assignment to the variable "mq_rq" in the mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() function. This assignment is not used after the jump, and it seems to be confusing and unnecessary.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization for ARMv6 and later processors. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the sti_vtg driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a missing of_node_put call after calling of_parse_phandle, which ensures that the device node obtained from of_parse_phandle is properly released when it is no longer needed.

This fix does not seem to be a trivial change, as it addresses a potential resource leak and ensures proper memory management. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as oops or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "__init" annotation from the "gpmc_hwecc_bch_capable" and "gpmc_nand_init" functions in the "gpmc-nand.c" file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a cleanup change rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch mainly involves converting the set_frontend function to use DVBv5 parameters and filling the supported delivery systems at dvb_frontend_ops struct.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains only trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding the necessary MFD (Multi-Function Device) cell information for the axp288 power key device. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the MFD cell info for the axp288 power key device, which suggests that it addresses a specific hardware functionality.

2. The patch includes the necessary resource definitions for the axp288 power button, specifying the interrupt resources for the power key events.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific hardware functionality and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, without further information about the nature of the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make a definitive decision, more information is needed about the bug or issue being fixed, its impact on the system, and whether it falls into the categories of critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, real security issues, or "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I cannot provide a conclusive answer at this time.
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames PVOID to "void *" in Misc.c, it appears to be a trivial fix involving a simple renaming of a variable type. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

(B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK)
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch is simply replacing the existing driver registration and unregistration calls with the new platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only introduces a minor code change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the "err_request_irq" label up in the code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch introduces a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to indicate that a set contains expressions for evaluation. It also adds a check to reject sets that specify both mapping and evaluation operations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific adaptation for the OMAP3-based igep0020 board to accommodate changes in the ehci-omap driver. 

The patch introduces changes to the initialization of USB PHY data for the igep0020 board. It registers the PHY's RESET regulators and the NOP PHY devices using the `usbhs_init_phys()` function. Additionally, it modifies the `igep2_usbhs_bdata` and `igep3_usbhs_bdata` structures to set the appropriate port modes and reset GPIOs.

From the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or a significant issue. It seems to be more of an adaptation to changes in the ehci-omap driver for the specific igep0020 board.

Without further context or information about any specific issues or bugs that this patch addresses, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the information available, it seems more likely that this patch is not critical enough to be included in a stable release. Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for port mirroring in the bcm_sf2 driver for DSA switches. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - No, this patch does not fix a bug. It adds a new feature (port mirroring) to the bcm_sf2 driver.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - No, the patch does not address any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is addressing an error path related to cursor handling in the vmwgfx driver.

2. The patch is signed-off by Jakob Bornecrantz and reviewed by Thomas Hellstrom, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

3. Looking at the code changes, it appears that if the surface is not suitable for the cursor, an error message is printed, and the surface is unreferenced before returning an error code.

4. The addition of the line "vmw_surface_unreference(&surface);" indicates that the surface is being properly unreferenced in the error path.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a real issue related to cursor handling in the vmwgfx driver. It is not a trivial fix, as it involves proper error handling and resource cleanup. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a superfluous check and a stray newline. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only makes the "i40e_stats" structure const and moves some data to text. This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of READ_TOPOLOGY reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the function `lpfc_mbx_cmpl_read_topology` in the file `drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_hbadisc.c`.

2. The patch introduces changes to handle the `la` (local adapter) structure and the `phba` (host bus adapter) structure.

3. The patch updates the comparison condition for `phba->fc_eventTag` and `la->eventTag` to use `<=` instead of `<` or `==`. This change ensures that the `fc_stat.LinkMultiEvent` counter is incremented correctly.

4. The patch adds a check for `phba->sli_rev` to determine if the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag should be updated. This check is necessary because the flag is only applicable for `sli_rev` less than `LPFC_SLI_REV4`.

5. The patch updates the condition for incrementing `phba->fc_stat.LinkUp` to also check if the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag is not set. This change ensures that the counter is incremented correctly.

6. The patch updates the condition for incrementing `phba->fc_stat.LinkDown` to also check if the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag is set. This change ensures that the counter is incremented correctly.

7. The patch adds a check for `phba->sli_rev` and `bf_get(lpfc_mbx_read_top_fa, la)` to determine if `lpfc_issue_clear_la` should be called. This check is necessary because `lpfc_issue_clear_la` is only called when `sli_rev` is less than `LPFC_SLI_REV4` and `lpfc_mbx_read_top_fa` is true.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields and ensures correct handling of flags and counters in the lpfc driver. The changes seem to be relevant and necessary to fix a potential issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving the validation of sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance values. The patch ensures that negative values cannot be written directly by users.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it improves the validation of a sysfs attribute.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup or spelling change. As per the criteria, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior. In IPv4, when a machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will get an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

2. The patch modifies the UDP error handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. When the machine receives an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message, the connected UDP socket will get an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

3. The patch includes changes to the __udp6_lib_err function in net/ipv6/udp.c.

4. It introduces a new variable, "harderr," which is used to determine if the error is a hard error.

5. If the ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message is received and the socket's pmtudisc is not set to IPV6_PMTUDISC_DONT, the "harderr" variable is set to 1.

6. If the socket's pmtudisc is set to IPV6_PMTUDISC_DONT, the patch follows the existing behavior and does not generate an EMSGSIZE message.

7. If the socket has the recverr flag set, the patch calls the ipv6_icmp_error function to handle the ICMP error.

8. Finally, the patch sets the socket's sk_err and sk_error_report fields.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior and ensures that the connected UDP socket in IPv6 receives an EMSGSIZE message on its next read when an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message is received. This fix addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the tty driver. The patch changes the return value from -ENOIOCTLCMD to -ENOTTY when the ioctl operation is not supported by the driver.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch should not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

In this case, the patch does not address any of the mentioned critical issues. It is a relatively minor fix that improves error handling by translating the error code from ENOIOCTLCMD to ENOTTY. This change does not fix a critical bug or address any security issues. Furthermore, it does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devexit_p. This macro is no longer needed because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply removes the "bright_max" variable and sets the brightness value directly in the netxbig_led_set() function. This change eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific performance bottleneck issue when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. The patch sets the CmdQue bit in the standard INQUIRY data to 1.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific performance optimization for a particular use case.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch would not be suitable for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and renaming of the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()`. The patch also moves the reference acquisition into the `init_and_link_css()` function.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This indicates that the function is only called in functions annotated with __init, which suggests that it is used during the initialization phase of the kernel.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature.

3. The prandom_start_seed_timer() function is responsible for setting up a timer that triggers the reseeding of the random number generator. This is an important functionality for ensuring the security and randomness of generated numbers.

4. The patch ensures that the __prandom_start_seed_timer() function is called during the initialization phase of the kernel by adding the __init prefix to its declaration.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a critical issue related to the initialization and reseeding of the random number generator. It does not introduce any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the code to use devm_ functions. This type of change is typically considered a "trivial" fix and does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8960: Use devm_regmap_init_i2c()" and it suggests using the `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` function instead of `regmap_init_i2c()` in the `wm8960_i2c_probe()` function of the `wm8960.c` file.

The rationale behind this change is that `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` is device managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup. Additionally, the patch mentions that there was no explicit `regmap_exit` call in the original function, which could be a bug.

Looking at the code changes, the line `wm8960->regmap = regmap_init_i2c(i2c, &wm8960_regmap);` is replaced with `wm8960->regmap = devm_regmap_init_i2c(i2c, &wm8960_regmap);`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change improves error handling and code cleanup by using a device-managed function. Additionally, it addresses a potential bug by ensuring that the `regmap_exit` call is not missed.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "perf symbols: Add path to Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file." It suggests adding the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file in the perf symbols code.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the vmlinux_path__init() function in the symbol.c file of the perf tool. It adds an additional entry to the vmlinux_path array, which contains paths to the vmlinux file used for symbol resolution.

3. Analysis:
   The patch appears to address a specific issue related to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file. It adds the path to the debuginfo file in the vmlinux_path array, allowing the perf tool to locate the file for symbol resolution.

   The change itself seems straightforward and does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It is focused on fixing a specific issue related to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

4. Criticality:
   Based on the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other "oh, that's not good" issue. The patch seems to address a specific functionality improvement rather than a critical bug.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases). While the patch may be useful for Ubuntu users or those specifically dealing with the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file, it does not appear to fix a critical bug or address a widespread issue that would warrant inclusion in the stable releases of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks in the `moboard_uart0_init()` and `moboard_uart0_exit()` functions.

2. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function initializes a GPIO pin (`MX31_PIN_CTS1`) and sets its direction as an output.

3. The `moboard_uart0_exit()` function frees the GPIO pin (`MX31_PIN_CTS1`).

4. The `uart0_pdata` structure is defined with the `moboard_uart0_init()` and `moboard_uart0_exit()` functions as its initialization and exit callbacks, respectively.

5. The `mx31moboard_init()` function calls `moboard_uart0_init()` to initialize the UART0 device.

6. The `serial_imx_probe()` function initializes the `imx_port` structure and sets the platform data initialization callback (`pdata->init()`) if available.

7. The `serial_imx_probe()` function adds the UART port using `uart_add_one_port()`.

8. The `serial_imx_remove()` function removes the UART port using `uart_remove_one_port()`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch removes the unnecessary `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks and simplifies the code. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch can be considered as trivial fixes since they involve removing unused code and simplifying the initialization process.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for initializing the BBP_R103 register in the rt2800 driver. The patch adds code to set the value of BBP_R103 based on specific conditions for different chip revisions.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems that the changes made to initialize BBP_R103 are specific to different chip revisions. This suggests that the patch addresses a hardware-specific issue related to the initialization of the BBP_R103 register. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Given the limited information available, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further analysis and information about the bug or issue being addressed would be necessary to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sizeimage setting in the coda driver for the media subsystem. The bug causes VIDIOC_TRY_FMT to return an incorrect value for sizeimage. The patch corrects this by calculating sizeimage as width * height * 3 / 2.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior. It does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend a NAK (not accepting) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch appears to be related to the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset.

2. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC for setting the number of transmit USB buffers.

3. The patch introduces a new static integer variable "vnt_tx_buffers" and uses it as the parameter for module_param_named.

4. However, there is a mistake in the module_param_named line. It mistakenly uses "vnt_rx_buffers" instead of "vnt_tx_buffers" as the parameter name.

5. Additionally, the patch does not include any explanation or justification for the change.

6. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

7. The changes made in this patch seem to be more of a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical issue.

Based on these observations, I would recommend a NAK for this patch as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of non-device managed APIs with their device managed counterparts. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function call with a recommended alternative. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only involves replacing a function call. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "i40e: avoid unnecessary register read" and the description states that there is no need to read the base VF id as it is already stored in the HW struct.

2. The change is made in the i40e_quiesce_vf_pci function in the i40e_virtchnl_pf.c file.

3. The line "vf_abs_id = vf->vf_id + hw->func_caps.vf_base_id;" replaces the previous line "reg = rd32(hw, I40E_PF_VT_PFALLOC); vf_abs_id = vf->vf_id + (reg & I40E_PF_VT_PFALLOC_FIRSTVF_MASK);". This change avoids reading the I40E_PF_VT_PFALLOC register and directly uses the vf_base_id from the hw struct.

4. The patch does not include any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It eliminates an unnecessary register read, which can improve performance and reduce overhead. However, it is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and does not take into account any potential side effects or conflicts with other parts of the codebase. A thorough review and testing should be conducted before including the patch in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch modifies the scsi_run_queue() function by splitting it into two separate functions, scsi_starved_list_run() and scsi_run_queue(). 

While the patch may improve code clarity and organization, it does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on code cleanup and renaming a function for aesthetics. The changes do not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field from the "sl811h_driver" structure in the "sl811-hcd.c" file. The patch claims to fix the "platform_no_drv_owner.cocci" warnings.

Since this patch only removes a single line of code and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ARM: amba: netx: get rid of NO_IRQ initializers." This suggests that it aims to remove the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field of the amba_device structure in the netx driver.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the .irq field is modified from ".irq = { NETX_IRQ_LCD, NO_IRQ }" to ".irq = { NETX_IRQ_LCD }". This change removes the NO_IRQ initializer.

3. The NO_IRQ initializer is typically used to indicate that a device does not have an interrupt associated with it. However, in this case, it seems that the NETX_IRQ_LCD is the only interrupt associated with the device.

4. Considering the context, it appears that the NO_IRQ initializer was mistakenly added in the original code. Removing it seems to be the correct action.

Based on this analysis, I would conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue where the NO_IRQ initializer was incorrectly used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the SPI bus clocks from the platform data. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary addition to the Linux kernel. The patch adds a helper function to lookup the master index of an l3mdev (Layer 3 master device) given a device index. This can be useful for various networking operations.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific functionality related to l3mdev, it can be considered a non-trivial fix. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue it aims to fix, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria of a real and critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the Linux kernel maintainers or experts to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an uninitialized variable warning.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and adjusting indentation. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow warning in the btrfs filesystem's send functionality. The expression "sizeof(*arg->clone_sources) * arg->clone_sources_count" is checked for potential overflow.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value of ULLONG_MAX. If the multiplication would result in an overflow, the patch returns -EINVAL and exits.

3. The patch also includes a review and sign-off from two developers, Dan Carpenter and David Sterba, indicating that the fix has been reviewed and approved.

4. The issue being fixed is not critical, as it is only a static checker warning. However, it is still beneficial to address such warnings to maintain code quality and avoid potential issues in the future.

Based on these points, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It fixes a potential issue, has been reviewed, and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and purpose.

The patch appears to be related to the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) subsystem, specifically the hda/realtek driver. It involves moving a quirk for the ALC255 audio codec used in Dell systems.

Looking at the changes made by the patch, it removes two SND_PCI_QUIRK entries for the ALC255_FIXUP_DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk and adds a new SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK entry for the same quirk. The new entry includes specific pin configurations for various audio input/output ports.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the bug being fixed or the impact it has. However, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the microphone presence detection on Dell systems using the ALC255 codec.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in -stable releases, if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it could potentially be accepted. However, without more information about the bug being fixed and its impact, it is challenging to make a definitive decision.

In conclusion, based on the limited information provided, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it addresses a critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug and its impact would be necessary to make a final determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for enabling MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) for the rt2x00pci driver in the Linux kernel. MSI is a feature of PCI Express that allows devices to use interrupts more efficiently.

Analyzing the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds the line "pci_enable_msi(pci_dev);" to enable MSI for the PCI device.

2. If the allocation of hardware fails, the patch jumps to "exit_disable_msi" to disable MSI before returning an error.

3. In the "rt2x00pci_remove" function, the patch adds the line "pci_disable_msi(pci_dev);" to disable MSI before freeing the PCI device data.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a real issue related to enabling and disabling MSI for the rt2x00pci driver. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and evaluation of the patch by the Linux kernel maintainers and experts to determine if it addresses a critical bug, security issue, or any other significant problem that warrants inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a type mismatch in the capi20_manufacturer() function. It changes the argument type from unsigned int to unsigned long in both the function prototype and the function definition.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate error message. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro called "IS_MAC_ADDRESS_BROADCAST" from the rtl871x_ioctl_set.c file in the staging directory. The macro is not used anywhere in the code, and its removal does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that increases the required skbuff headroom for firmware signaling. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not seem to fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, my analysis is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a "name" field to the omapdss's outputs structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any impact on the stability or functionality of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup or a spelling change. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag in the samples/seccomp/dropper.c file. This flag is required to enable seccomp, and the patch allows the dropper program to be run without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to fix a potential security issue by enabling PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS. This flag restricts the process from gaining additional privileges after it has been executed. By enabling this flag, the patch helps to mitigate the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

Considering that the patch addresses a real security issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/exynos: fix buffer pitch calculation" and is signed-off by three individuals.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the calculation of the buffer pitch in the exynos_drm_gem_dumb_create function in the exynos_drm_gem.c file.

   Before the patch:
   args->pitch = args->width * args->bpp >> 3;

   After the patch:
   args->pitch = args->width * ((args->bpp + 7) / 8);

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses the buffer pitch calculation in the exynos_drm_gem_dumb_create function. The original calculation used a right shift operation (>>) to divide the result by 8, which assumes that the bpp value is always a multiple of 8. However, this assumption may not hold true in all cases.

   The patch modifies the calculation to use a more robust approach by adding 7 to the bpp value before dividing it by 8. This ensures that the pitch is correctly calculated even when the bpp value is not a multiple of 8.

4. Impact:
   The incorrect buffer pitch calculation could lead to data corruption or display issues in the affected code. By fixing this calculation, the patch aims to prevent potential issues related to buffer pitch.

5. Triviality:
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to buffer pitch calculation.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue related to buffer pitch calculation, which could potentially lead to data corruption or display issues. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to be a valid and necessary improvement to the code.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "regulators" array in the lp3972.c file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is a "trivial" fix as it only involves adding a qualifier to a variable declaration.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable atomic fb-helper support in the i915 driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for atomic fb-helper paths in the i915 driver. This suggests that it addresses a functionality improvement rather than fixing a critical bug.

2. The patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it resolves. It only states that i915 supports enough atomic to have atomic fb-helper paths.

3. The patch does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address a real and critical issue. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds error handling for hdmi_probe_pdata() function, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue or bug.

2. The return type of hdmi_probe_pdata() is changed from void to int, indicating that it now returns an error code.

3. The patch checks if plat_dssdev is NULL and returns 0 (success) if it is. This indicates that if a resource is missing, the driver will be probed again later.

4. The patch allocates and initializes a new dssdev device. If the allocation fails, it returns -ENOMEM (indicating an out-of-memory error).

5. The patch copies the platform data from plat_dssdev to dssdev.

6. The patch initializes the new device and checks if the initialization fails. If it does, it returns the error code.

7. The patch sets the new device as the output device for the HDMI output. If the operation fails, it returns the error code.

8. The patch adds the new device to the list of devices. If the addition fails, it returns the error code.

9. Finally, the patch returns 0 if all the operations are successful.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by adding proper error handling for hdmi_probe_pdata(). It handles cases where resources are missing, allocation fails, initialization fails, and setting the output device fails. The patch also returns appropriate error codes in case of failures.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to SDIO controllers found on Marvell Kirkwood SoCs causing spurious interrupts, even when all interrupts have been disabled. This indicates a real and critical bug that can potentially cause unexpected behavior.

2. The patch includes a clear explanation of the issue and the proposed workaround. It bails out of the interrupt handler early if no interrupts are expected, effectively avoiding any potential harm caused by the spurious interrupt.

3. The patch includes relevant sign-offs from multiple contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The added code in the patch is not trivial, as it includes conditional checks and debug logging to handle the spurious interrupt scenario.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. The patch modifies the qla2x00_gpn_id, qla2x00_gnn_id, and qla2x00_gfpn_id functions to stop iteration after the first failure. 

The patch introduces a break statement after the failure condition in each of the mentioned functions. This change ensures that the iteration stops when a failure occurs, preventing further unnecessary processing. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a functional improvement to the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing inline wrappers for nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64 functions in the netlink subsystem. These functions are required to provide fields for nl802154 userspace applications.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the deprecated macro DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE(). The patch replaces it with the recommended usage of 'struct pci_device_id'. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to suspend the phydev when it enters the HALTED state to save power.
   - This is not a critical bug fix, but rather an optimization for power-saving purposes. It does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

2. The patch calls the `phy_suspend` helper function when entering the HALTED state.
   - This indicates that the patch is introducing a new functionality related to power management.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by Mugunthan V N and Florian Fainelli.
   - The Acked-by tag indicates that the reviewers have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. It introduces a power-saving optimization, which is not considered a critical fix for a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some unused #defines from the wlan_bssdef.h file in the staging driver for the rtl8723au wireless chipset. The removed #defines are related to NDIS_802_11_STATUS_TYPE and NDIS_802_11_AUTH_REQUEST, which are not used anywhere else in the code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch aims to refactor the soft_offline_page() function in the mm/memory-failure.c file. It addresses the issue of multiple return points randomly intermingled with some "goto done" return points. The patch adjusts the function structure to have separate paths for success and failure, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, the patch replaces the use of atomic_long_add with atomic_long_inc, which is a more appropriate function for incrementing atomic long variables.

The changes made in the patch do not fall under the category of trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they improve the code structure and address potential issues related to soft offline of memory pages.

Therefore, considering the nature of the changes and the fact that they improve code readability and maintainability, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary out-of-memory (OOM) messages. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only removes unnecessary OOM messages. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that checks the return values of the nla_parse() function in multiple places. This is important because it ensures that the attributes being parsed are actually what is expected, making the policy effective.

The patch also includes error handling in case the nla_parse() function fails, returning the appropriate error code and handling the failure gracefully.

Considering the patch addresses a potential issue with attribute parsing and includes proper error handling, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `of_find_property()` with `of_property_read_u32()` for reading integer values. This change aims to reduce the number of variables used.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it focuses on code cleanup and optimization.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a call to `seq_printf` with `seq_puts` in the `sky2_debug_show` function of the `sky2.c` file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple change that improves code readability but does not address any significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to VLAN handling in the i40e driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions in the i40e driver.

2. The change updates the function signatures to use u16 instead of s16 for the vid parameter. This change is made because the functions no longer expect to be called with VID=I40E_VLAN_ANY.

3. The patch adds a check in both i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions to ensure that the vid parameter is not zero and that the PVID (Primary VLAN ID) is not set. If either of these conditions is true, the functions return an error (-EINVAL).

4. The i40e_add_vlan_all_mac and i40e_rm_vlan_all_mac functions are not modified by this patch.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to VLAN handling in the i40e driver. It ensures that the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions are not used when the vid parameter is zero or when the PVID is set. This change prevents accidental invocation of VLAN mode handling and removes the need for certain checks in the i40e_vsi_add_vlan function.

Considering that the patch fixes a specific bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The patch removes the unnecessary check for 'sk' being NULL before calling sock_get_timestamp(). 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `cpia1.c` file of the `gspca` driver in the `media` subsystem. The patch converts a nonnegative error return code to a negative one, which is consistent with the error handling convention in the function.

Since the patch addresses a real bug by correcting the error return code, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the NVRAM location from 14 to 16 for reading the SCSI host ID. This change is based on documentation and confirmed by testing. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific hardware issue related to the RT5645 codec. The patch adds support for the ACPI ID "10EC5640" and includes a DMI quirk for jack detection.

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a specific hardware issue related to the RT5645 codec on certain CHT platforms. It adds support for the ACPI ID "10EC5640" and includes a DMI quirk for jack detection. This can be considered a real and critical bug fix.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues. It is focused on adding support for a specific hardware configuration.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It specifically adds support for the ACPI ID "10EC5640" and includes a DMI quirk for jack detection.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes or issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug related to dereferencing a null pointer in the redrat3 driver. The original code dereferences "rr3" when it is NULL, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The patch itself introduces a change in the error handling logic. Instead of using the "error" label to handle the memory allocation failure, it now uses the "no_endpoints" label. This change does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fact that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that could potentially lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused code and removes setting the gadget name in the driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a constant value from `AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_RECOVERY` to `AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_INIT_RECOVERY`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to "unclaimed register" messages on Haswell after suspend/resume. The patch checks the generation of the Intel graphics device and only saves and restores the DSPARB register if the generation is less than or equal to 4.

Given that the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary Out-of-Memory (OOM) messages. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only removes unnecessary OOM messages. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "idle_bias_off" option to the cs53l30_codec_driver structure. This option enables the DAPM core to set the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF instead of stopping at SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the names of the SND_SOC_DAPM_SPK widgets from "DP" to "DP1" and "DP2", and the corresponding routes from "DP" to "hif6 Output" and "hif5 Output" to "DP1" and "DP2" respectively.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only changes the names of the widgets and routes, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the memory_lseek() function in the drivers/char/mem.c file. The patch replaces a comparison of the new offset to a hard-coded value of -MAX_ERRNO with the use of IS_ERR_VALUE().

The use of IS_ERR_VALUE() is a more appropriate and reliable way to check for error values. It ensures that the error value is correctly identified, regardless of the specific value of -MAX_ERRNO.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to userland mistaking f_pos=-9 as -EBADF=-9, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to power management for the RX-51 board. It adds a definition for the regulator supplying the CSIb complex. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, it is a trivial fix as it does not address any significant issue.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the TX wakeup bit for the wer register in OMAP2+ UART. This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to the TX wakeup functionality.

2. It populates the necessary TX wakeup flag for the applicable module IP blocks and uses it while configuring the wer register. This indicates that the patch ensures the correct configuration of the TX wakeup feature.

3. The patch also restores the wer register when context is lost. This implies that it handles the restoration of the register to maintain proper functionality.

4. The patch includes additional changes related to feature flags and error handling for different UART revisions.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the TX wakeup functionality in OMAP2+ UART. It also includes necessary changes for feature flags and error handling. However, without further information about the severity and impact of the issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the appropriate maintainers and experts to determine if the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds a new netdev operation to allow or prevent a Virtual Function (VF) from querying its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It is limited to 82599 and x540 devices for now, with support for other devices to be added later.

     - The function ixgbe_configure_virtualization() is modified to enable or disable the RSS query feature for each VF.
     - The net_device_ops structure is updated to include the new netdev operation ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en.

   - In ixgbe_sriov.c:
     - The function __ixgbe_enable_sriov() is modified to set the rss_query_enabled flag to 0 for all VFs of 82599 and x540 devices.

   - In ixgbe_sriov.h:
     - The function ixgbe_ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en is declared.

3. Analysis:
   This patch introduces a new netdev operation to control the ability of a VF to query its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It also sets the rss_query_enabled flag to 0 for all VFs of 82599 and x540 devices in the __ixgbe_enable_sriov() function.

   The patch appears to address a specific feature related to RSS querying for certain devices. However, it does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for an existing problem.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply adds a check to gate the clock when the bus frequency is set to 0 in the sunxi-mmc driver. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip. The patch increases the total number of interrupts from 8 to 34, which aligns with the three different interrupt ranges handled by the TWL4030 (8 for the core, 8 for power events, and 18 for GPIOs).

Since this patch fixes a real bug related to interrupt management and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to extend the frequency range of the Max2165 tuner driver to cover Hong Kong's digital TV broadcasting. The change increases the maximum frequency from 780000000 to 862000000.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a specific enhancement to support a particular TV tuner card in Hong Kong.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in the stable branch as it does not address a critical issue or provide a necessary fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for antenna diversity configuration for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. The patch checks the chip version using the AR_SREV_9485 macro and sets the appropriate values for the antenna configuration based on the chip type.

Since this patch fixes a specific issue related to antenna diversity configuration on non-AR9485 chips, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to parenthesis alignment in the ppdev.c file. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, this patch seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'thisboard' macro and replaces it with local variables and the 'comedi_board()' helper function. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cleanup or refactoring change rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that adds a new property "phy-reset-duration" for device tree probe in the fec driver. This property allows boards to specify a longer reset duration if needed. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. It is more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It can be considered for inclusion in future kernel versions or specific board-specific branches, but it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting pointer math to array access. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of whitespace cleanup or code style improvement. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the "nct7802_regmap_config" struct in the "nct7802" driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix, as it only adds the "const" qualifier to the struct definition.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve interrupt handling in the meson-gx MMC driver. It makes the following changes:

1. In the `meson_mmc_request` function, the patch removes the code that clears, acknowledges, and enables all interrupts. This code is unnecessary and doesn't provide any benefit. Disabling and immediately re-enabling interrupts in this context is not required. This change improves the efficiency of interrupt handling.

2. In the `meson_mmc_probe` function, the patch adds the code to enable all interrupts. This was missing in the original code. Enabling interrupts in the probe function ensures that interrupts are properly set up when the driver is initialized.

3. In the `meson_mmc_remove` function, the patch adds the code to disable interrupts. This was also missing in the original code. Disabling interrupts in the remove function ensures that interrupts are properly cleaned up when the driver is removed.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to interrupt handling in the meson-gx MMC driver. It improves the code by removing unnecessary interrupt handling operations and adding missing interrupt enable/disable operations. These changes are not trivial and can potentially fix issues related to interrupt handling in the driver.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb_probe() function in the staging driver for XGI graphics. The "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed due to the removal of the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compile warning in the ARM implementation of psci_init. The change simply adds a return statement with a value of 0 to the inline function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve dropping unneeded checks and removing some conditional statements. Since the patch does not address any specific issue or bug, and it only involves trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug, nor does it fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch seems to be aimed at optimizing the code by avoiding redundant function calls.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unnecessary casting of a void pointer. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls outside the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture. The patch modifies the code to ensure that device tree accesses in the cache info code are endian safe.

The patch changes the type of the variables `cache_size`, `line_size`, and `nr_sets` from `u32` to `__be32`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing endianness-related issues.

The patch also replaces the assignment of `*ret` with `of_read_number()` calls, which suggests that the patch is modifying how the cache size, line size, and number of sets are read from the device tree.

Without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem being fixed. However, based on the provided information, it does not appear to be a trivial fix such as a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it seems to address a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture. However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis and testing should be conducted before including the patch in the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointer to the `musb` structure from the `tusb_omap_dma` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or significant improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the functions `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. These functions are currently defined as non-static, but they are only used within the same source file `dst_cache.c`. 

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only involves making these functions static, which is considered a trivial change, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch.pl issue related to lines over 80 characters in the serqt_usb2.c file. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a few missing clocks for different MIPS platforms. The patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential issue with the order of operations in the dsa_slave_create() function. The patch ensures that the netdev is registered before connecting the phy, which avoids an info message with an uninitialized name.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a direct comparison of jiffies with a call to the time_before function. The purpose of this change is to make the code more robust for comparing jiffies against other values.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a minor improvement that does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the struct device pointer to point to the USB device instead of the input device. This change seems to be more of a preference or design decision rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the usage of BUG_ON macro in the mmc_ext_csd_open function in the debugfs file_operations callback. Instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch returns an error value and propagates it to the caller.

The reason for removing the BUG_ON is that it is considered meaningless in this context. The patch author mentions that they don't believe the condition "n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN" could happen. However, to handle any unexpected scenarios, the patch introduces proper error handling by setting the error value to -EINVAL and jumping to the "out_free" label.

This change improves the code by providing a more meaningful error handling mechanism instead of triggering a BUG_ON, which is typically used for asserting conditions that should never happen. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, considering the nature of the change and the improvement it brings, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the attribute index for temperature sensors in the ixgbe driver. While it aligns with the hwmon ABI specification, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a casting of a void pointer returned by kmalloc. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup. As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the default behavior of the perf tools. The patch removes the "filter_relative" option, which was previously set to true, and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any real or critical bug.

Since the patch does not address any critical issue, fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the mos7720.c driver to use the module_usb_serial_driver() call instead of having a module_init/module_exit function. This change eliminates duplicated code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary braces in the code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves an assignment statement out of an if () block. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, which is not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Title: hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host
   - The patch aims to handle the case where the host reduces the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the `nvsp_message` structure in `netvsc.c` to include the new MTU value.
   - It also updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function in `netvsc_drv.c` to set the limit for MTU based on `NETVSC_MTU - ETH_HLEN`.
   - Additionally, it adds code in `rndis_filter.c` to retrieve the MTU value from the host and assign it to `net_device->ndev->mtu`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific scenario where the host reduces the MTU due to encapsulation requirements.
   - It ensures that the correct MTU value is used in the communication between the guest and the host.
   - The changes made in the patch are focused on handling the reduced MTU value and updating the necessary structures and functions accordingly.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - It addresses a specific scenario related to MTU reduction by the host, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.
   - However, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug that causes severe issues.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases). While it addresses a specific scenario, it does not fix a critical bug or address a severe issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of using the fast lookup table to set the baud rate only when the ioclk is 150MHz. However, some boards might set ioclk to a different frequency.

2. The patch recalculates the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz.

3. The patch also includes changes to get the clk in the probe function and put it in remove.

4. The patch removes the variable "ioclk_rate" and the associated code that sets it to 150000000.

5. The patch conditionally applies the fast calculation for clk_div_reg only when port->uartclk is 150000000.

6. The patch retrieves the clk in the probe function, enables it, and sets port->uartclk to the clock rate.

7. The patch disables and unprepares the clk in the remove function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific issue related to the baud rate calculation when the ioclk is not 150MHz. It introduces necessary changes to handle different clock frequencies and ensures the correct calculation of clk_div_reg. Additionally, it includes proper handling of the clk resource in the probe and remove functions.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not consider any broader context or dependencies.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the `regulator_register` function in `drivers/regulator/core.c` and replaces the open-coded `_regulator_is_enabled` function call with a new helper function `_regulator_is_enabled`.

2. The `_regulator_is_enabled` function is already defined and implemented elsewhere in the codebase.

3. The patch also modifies the `regulator_suspend_finish` function in `drivers/regulator/core.c` and replaces the open-coded check for `ops->is_enabled` with a call to `_regulator_is_enabled`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a code cleanup by replacing open-coded checks with a helper function. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch can be considered as trivial fixes, as they involve code refactoring and cleanup rather than addressing critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch converts the variable "num_drc_entries" from an unsigned int to an atomic_t type, allowing for atomic operations on the variable without the need for spinlocking.

The patch also updates the code to use atomic operations such as atomic_dec, atomic_inc, and atomic_read instead of directly modifying the variable. This ensures that concurrent access to "num_drc_entries" is properly synchronized and avoids potential race conditions.

Since this patch addresses a potential concurrency issue and improves the code's correctness, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that exports the `confirm_error_lock` symbol. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a formatting issue in the perf trace code. The patch adds a closing parenthesis ')' to the fprintf statement in the trace__sys_enter function. 

Since this patch only addresses a formatting issue and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment in the cxgb4vf driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the "do_gro" function in the "sge.c" file of the cxgb4vf driver. It adds an increment to the "vlan_ex" counter in the "rxq->stats" structure when "pkt->vlan_ex" is true. This counter keeps track of the number of VLAN packets processed by the driver.

The change itself seems to be addressing a real issue related to VLAN extraction. It ensures that the VLAN tag is correctly extracted from the packet and increments the counter accordingly. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it involves modifying the code logic and adding a counter increment.

However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the issue. If the bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant problem, then this patch may be considered for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, I would lean towards accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK), assuming the bug it fixes meets the criteria for acceptance. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug and its impact would be necessary for a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL function in the amdgpu driver. The patch adds amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in different cases of the switch statement, ensuring that the BO is properly unreserved before returning from the function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a potential issue related to resource management in the driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch splits the function `media_graph_walk_next()` into two functions, `media_graph_walk_iter()` and `media_graph_walk_next()`. This refactoring aims to simplify the code and improve readability.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable oprofile support on Lantiq targets for MIPS architecture. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not a fix for a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an AUXDATA entry for the "nvidia,tegra30-ahub" device. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the `finit_module` syscall in the SH architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - No, it does not fix a bug. It adds support for a new syscall.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - No, it does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - No, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the return statement from "return rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);" to "return !!rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);". This change ensures that the return value is clamped to either 0 or 1.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the twl6040_power() function in the mfd/twl6040.c file. The patch checks the return value of the clk_prepare_enable() function and propagates the error in case of failure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds error handling by checking the return value of clk_prepare_enable() function.
2. If the return value is non-zero (indicating a failure), the patch resets the power_count variable and jumps to the "out" label, effectively propagating the error.
3. This error handling ensures that if clk_prepare_enable() fails, the power_count variable is reset, preventing any incorrect state.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue and meets the criteria for acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to remove duplicate code by having the ftrace arch_ftrace_update_code() use the generic ftrace_modify_all_code() function.

2. The ftrace_replace_code() function is modified to become a weak function so that an architecture may override it.

3. The arch_ftrace_update_code() function is modified to call ftrace_modify_all_code() instead of ftrace_replace_code().

4. The ftrace_replace_code() function is defined in include/linux/ftrace.h and implemented in kernel/trace/ftrace.c.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making changes to the ftrace functionality in the x86 architecture. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a code refactoring or optimization rather than fixing a specific problem.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical issue or addressing a real problem.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch adds a check for `sp->role.invalid` in `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page` before calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`. This check ensures that the `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` function is only called when `sp->role.invalid` is false.

2. Additionally, the patch adds a check for `is_obsolete_sp()` before calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`. This check ensures that `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` is only called when `is_obsolete_sp()` returns false.

3. The patch also adds comments explaining that the obsolete pages cannot be used on any vCPUs and refers to the comments in `kvm_mmu_invalidate_zap_all_pages()`.

Based on the changes made, it appears that the patch aims to optimize the `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page()` function by reducing the number of calls to `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`. This optimization is achieved by adding the mentioned checks to avoid unnecessary calls to `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`.

Considering the nature of the changes, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be an optimization to reduce unnecessary calls to `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()`. This function is responsible for disabling the ISA DMA controller and returning the residue as described in `Documentation/DMA-ISA-LPC.txt`. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific functionality related to ISA DMA controller handling.

2. The patch includes changes to the `disable_dma_on_even()` function, which now uses the `das16_isadma_disable()` function to disable the DMA channel and retrieve the residue. This change improves the code readability and maintainability.

3. The `das16_interrupt()` function has been modified to remove the unnecessary `claim_dma_lock()` and `release_dma_lock()` calls. This change simplifies the code and improves performance.

4. The `das16_alloc_dma()` function has been modified to use the `das16_isadma_disable()` function instead of the `claim_dma_lock()` and `release_dma_lock()` calls. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the patch addresses specific functionality related to ISA DMA controller handling and improves code readability and maintainability. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the nct6775 driver in the hwmon subsystem. The patch introduces a new function called "add_temp_sensors" which scans for additional temperature sources and enables monitoring if available. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

From the patch description and code changes, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Instead, it adds functionality to detect and report additional temperature sources. 

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch would not be considered critical enough to be included in a stable release. Hence, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to USB endpoint types in the dwc3 gadget driver. The patch replaces a BUG() statement with a dev_WARN() statement, which warns about an unknown endpoint type instead of causing a system crash.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other severe issue. It seems to address a non-critical issue related to USB endpoint types.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch changes the behavior of vendor specific commands in the brcmfmac driver. Previously, these commands always used the main interface, but now they will use the interface supplied by the caller.

2. The patch has been reviewed by Arend Van Spriel and Pieter-Paul Giesberts, both from Broadcom, and they have provided their Reviewed-by tags.

3. The patch has been signed-off by Hante Meuleman, Arend van Spriel, and John W. Linville.

4. The code changes in the patch involve modifying the brcmf_cfg80211_vndr_cmds_dcmd_handler function. Instead of using the net_device structure obtained from the wiphy structure, it now uses the brcmf_cfg80211_vif and brcmf_if structures to access the interface.

5. The patch also includes some minor changes in the code, such as updating variable names and adding a few lines of code to retrieve the interface from the wireless_dev structure.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver and improves the handling of vendor specific commands by using the correct interface. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves changes to the code logic and structure access.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or security issues in the brcmfmac driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the serial-uartlite driver. The patch modifies the `ulite_isr` function by moving the spinlock acquisition and release inside the loop, reducing the time the spinlock is held.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or code improvement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the direction parameter from DMA_TO_DEVICE to DMA_MEM_TO_DEV and DMA_FROM_DEVICE to DMA_DEV_TO_MEM in the snd_mxs_pcm_hw_params function of the mxs-pcm.c file.

Since this patch only involves a simple parameter change and does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a suggestion to print out a message informing the user that they could try using the "pci=realloc" boot parameter if some PCI device resources are unassigned. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is more of a suggestion or informational message for the user.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address any critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing static storage class specifiers in the udl_connector.c file. The patch addresses sparse warnings related to undeclared symbols and suggests making certain functions and structures static.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and only addresses sparse warnings, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that replaces the usage of 0 and 1 with the true and false defines for boolean variables in the af9013.c file of the media subsystem. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves spelling changes and whitespace cleanups. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with the alternatives patching on secondary CPUs in the arm64 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description explains that in order to ensure the patched instruction stream is visible to a CPU, that CPU must execute an `isb` instruction after any related cache maintenance has completed. This suggests that without the `isb` instruction, secondary cores may be left in a state where they are executing a mix of old and new code.

2. The patch adds an `isb` instruction following the secondary polling loop in the alternatives patching code.

3. The `isb` instruction is a synchronization barrier that ensures that any instructions following it are fetched from the updated instruction stream. This helps to avoid potential issues caused by executing a mix of old and new code.

4. The patch is signed-off by Will Deacon, who is a recognized contributor to the arm64 architecture.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue with the alternatives patching on secondary CPUs and ensures that the patched instruction stream is properly visible to all CPUs.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is addressing a bug related to the QM (Queue Manager) initialization logic in the qed driver for QLogic Ethernet devices. The bug is related to not passing the number of tasks to the QM init logic, which can cause back-pressure and reduced performance in scenarios requiring many tasks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that can lead to reduced performance. It does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to the addition of a route in IPv6. The issue is that if a nonsensical route is added, the route lookup will pick the wrong outdev due to the prefix route that is added before Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) work is started. This can lead to incorrect routing behavior.

The patch adds an explicit test to check if the nexthop gateway is a local address. If it is, the patch returns an error, preventing the addition of the route until the address is no longer in the tentative state.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that can cause incorrect routing behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/tegra: sor - Fix copy/paste error". This suggests that the patch aims to fix a copy/paste error in the code.

2. The patch includes two "Signed-off-by" lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

3. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the value assigned to the "value" variable in the "tegra_output_sor_enable" function.

4. In the original code, the value assigned to "value" includes the flag "SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B" twice, which seems to be a copy/paste error.

5. The patch corrects the error by replacing one occurrence of "SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B" with "SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_A".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a copy/paste error in the code. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the fix itself is relatively trivial, as it only involves correcting a single line of code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error on the arm64 architecture. The error is caused by the undeclared 'PERF_REGS_MAX' variable in the 'util/event.h' file.

The patch adds a definition for 'PERF_REGS_MAX' in the 'tools/perf/arch/arm64/include/perf_regs.h' file. It also includes the necessary headers and defines 'PERF_REGS_MASK', 'PERF_REG_IP', and 'PERF_REG_SP' based on 'PERF_REG_ARM64_MAX'.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem. It is a trivial fix that does not fall under the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch is a trivial fix that initializes the boolean variable 'found' to false. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a compiler warning related to a debug print statement in the iommu.c file. The change modifies the format specifier for the "pgsize" variable in the pr_debug statement.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the MIPS architecture. The bug was introduced by commit c5b367835cfc, which added support for XPA. The issue arises from the assumption of constant offsets for _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE relative to _PAGE_PRESENT, which is no longer true for some MIPS32R2 builds.

The patch addresses this issue by using the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask instead of hardcoding the values. This ensures that the correct mask is applied regardless of the specific MIPS32R2 build.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause build errors or other issues on affected MIPS32R2 builds.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The changes made in the patch are simply replacing the usage of the `greybus_set_drvdata` function with direct assignments to the `gdev->gb_tty` field.

Since the patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only contains trivial changes, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that defines a constant for the LRW block size and replaces the usage of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` with the defined constant `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the argument "virq" to "irq" in the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map`. This change removes the reference to "virtual" IRQ, stating that the IRQ is not any more "virtual" than any other Linux IRQ number.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds additional fields to be recognized by the WACOM_PEN_FIELD and WACOM_FINGER_FIELD macros in the HID Wacom driver. The patch does not fix any real or critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to unprivileged users revealing what is under a mount. The patch checks if the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag is set and if the CL_EXPIRE flag is not set or if the old mount's mnt_expire list is empty. If these conditions are met, the MNT_LOCKED flag is set for the new mount.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear if this patch addresses any of the mentioned critical issues. It seems to be more of a security-related fix to prevent unprivileged users from accessing certain mount information. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine its criticality.

Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless additional information is provided to demonstrate its criticality and impact on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a quirk for the ASUS X75VD laptop to ensure Wi-Fi works when the asus_nb_wmi module is loaded with the wapf=4 option. 

While this patch does address a specific issue with Wi-Fi on the ASUS X75VD laptop, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the overall stability or security of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a prefix to the print format in the asymmetric key signature handling code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only adds a prefix to the print format. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses warnings reported by the compiler. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a trivial fix that marks a function as static. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces two new knobs, idgen_retries and idgen_delay, for IPv6 address generation. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. 

The patch modifies the netns_sysctl_ipv6 structure in include/net/netns/ipv6.h to include the new knobs idgen_retries and idgen_delay. It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in inet6_net_init() function in net/ipv6/af_inet6.c and adds corresponding entries in the ipv6_table_template and ipv6_table structures in net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c.

In addrconf_dad_failure() function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch replaces the hardcoded values of idgen_retries and idgen_delay with the values from the net->ipv6.sysctl structure.

In ipv6_generate_stable_address() function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch replaces the hardcoded value of idgen_retries with the value from dev_net(idev->dev)->ipv6.sysctl structure.

Overall, this patch introduces new knobs for IPv6 address generation and makes the necessary changes to use these knobs instead of hardcoded values.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It introduces new functionality and configuration options, but it does not address any existing critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ALSA: hda - Avoid auto-mute or auto-mic of retasked jacks." This suggests that it aims to address an issue related to auto-mute or auto-mic functionality in the ALSA HDA (High Definition Audio) driver.

2. The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` function in `hda_generic.c` and the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function.

3. In the `detect_jacks` function, the patch adds a check to skip the automute or autoswitch when a pin is retasked as an input. This prevents the retasked input pin from being counted as the target for automatic jack switching.

4. In the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function, the patch adds a similar check to skip the detection of pins retasked as outputs. This ensures that only the appropriate pins are considered for the autoswitch functionality.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to retasked jacks and improves the accuracy of the automute and autoswitch functionality in the ALSA HDA driver. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does address a potential problem that could affect the functionality of the audio system.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis and testing should be conducted by the Linux kernel maintainers to ensure the patch's effectiveness and compatibility with the overall system.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be fixing a build error by adding a missing declaration of the `cmpxchg64` function. Since the error is related to a missing function declaration, it does not seem to fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

The correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to calculating the location of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. The patch addresses the issue of the touchpad not reporting relative data, which causes the absence of query 6 and the need to adjust the address of query 8 accordingly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a relatively minor fix related to the calculation of the query address.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the application of feature fixups earlier in the code execution flow, specifically in the `early_setup()` function. This change is aimed at aligning the behavior of 64-bit with 32-bit.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, and it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" problems, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported in the zl10353 driver for DVB frontends. The patch changes the calculation of the SNR value from a raw hardware register value to a value in a 0.1 dB scale.

While this change may improve the accuracy or usability of the reported SNR value, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC interrupt controller driver. The patch adds more register documentation, including register names and their corresponding addresses.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it is a trivial fix that adds documentation.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a "line over 80" issue, which refers to a line in the code exceeding 80 characters in length. This type of issue does not cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is considered a coding style issue rather than a critical bug.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. This build error is caused by the 'rspi_of_match' variable being undeclared in the 'rspi_probe' function of the 'spi-rspi.c' file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a build error that occurs when a specific configuration option is not set.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi driver. The patch modifies the if condition by changing the logical OR operator (||) to a logical AND operator (&&). 

The original if condition checks if the sscanf function successfully reads an integer from the buf string and if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the patch changes the logical OR operator to a logical AND operator, which means that the condition will only be true if both the sscanf function fails to read an integer and the mode is not equal to 2 or 1.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch introduces a logical error. The intention of the patch is likely to ensure that the mode variable is either 2 or 1, but the modified condition will always evaluate to true. This means that the function will always return -EINVAL, regardless of the value of mode.

Considering that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather introduces a logical error, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for vring deallocation in the wil6210 driver. The patch adds debug prints to display information about the vring being deallocated, including its index, size, virtual address, physical address, and context.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial change that adds debug prints for informational purposes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves some variables from one file to another in the staging/brcm80211 driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch includes some trivial changes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to avoid common clk framework warnings. This change is not a trivial fix as it addresses a potential issue with the clock framework.

2. The patch adds error handling for the `clk_prepare_enable` calls in the `atmel_usba_start` function. If either of these calls fails, the function will return the error code and clean up the previously enabled clocks.

3. Similarly, the patch adds error handling for the `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_stop` function. This ensures that the clocks are properly disabled and unprepared in case of an error.

4. In the `usba_udc_probe` function, the patch adds error handling for the `clk_prepare_enable` call for `pclk`. If this call fails, an error message is printed, and the function aborts.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses potential issues with clock handling in the `atmel_usba` gadget driver. It introduces proper error handling and cleanup in case of failures during clock enable/disable operations.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue and improves the reliability of the `atmel_usba` gadget driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __func__ macro from the dev_err logging statements in the gdm72xx driver. The purpose of this change is to clean up the log printout by removing the specific function name from the error message.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for setting correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions in the x86/PCI code. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch moves the final fixups from the __init section to the __devinit section. This change is necessary because final fixups are executed during device enumeration, which may happen after boot if hotplug is supported. Therefore, final fixups cannot be in the __init section.

2. The function `quirk_amd_nb_node` is modified to use the __devinit annotation instead of __init. This annotation indicates that the function is only used during device initialization and will not be used after that.

3. The function `quirk_amd_nb_node` sets correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions. This fix is specific to AMD systems and ensures that the correct NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node information is assigned to the AMD NB functions.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a specific issue related to setting correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions. While it does not address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it does fix an issue that could potentially lead to incorrect NUMA node assignments on AMD systems.

Considering that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the final decision ultimately rests with the Linux kernel maintainers.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the Acer Aspire 5741 laptop model. The patch adds the laptop model to the quirk table in the acer-wmi driver, which is responsible for handling ACPI video backlight control.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a broken ACPI video backlight control issue specific to the Acer Aspire 5741 model.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any new issues or trivial changes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver. This is important because DMA mapping can fail, and it's necessary to handle such errors appropriately.

2. The patch checks for DMA mapping errors when mapping the sense buffer. If an error occurs, it logs a debug message and returns 0, indicating a failure.

3. The patch also checks for DMA mapping errors when mapping the scatter-gather list (sglist). If an error occurs, it logs a debug message and returns ASC_BUSY, indicating a failure.

4. In the adv_build_req function, the patch adds the same error checking for DMA mapping of the sense buffer and sglist.

5. In the asc_execute_scsi_cmnd function, the patch handles the return value of asc_build_req appropriately. If asc_build_req returns ASC_NOERROR, the execution continues. Otherwise, it logs a build_error and returns the appropriate error code.

Overall, the patch adds necessary error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, ensuring that any failures are properly handled. It addresses potential issues that could lead to build errors, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a critical bug fix and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve adding a warning and checking for object size overflow.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch are straightforward and do not introduce any new risks or regressions.

4. The patch has been reviewed: The patch has been reviewed by Tvrtko Ursulin, which adds credibility to its correctness and effectiveness.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug related to object size limitations.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a debug level for channel context in the ath9k driver.

However, this patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It is a functional fix that ensures the correct initialization of the "all_device_types" field.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, I would classify this patch as a minor fix that does not address a critical bug or a real security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for proper error handling in the `init_dma_pools()` function in the `amd5536udc` driver for USB gadget. The patch addresses the issue of not properly handling the failure to allocate memory for the `data_requests` and `stp_requests` pools.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it focuses on improving error handling and resource cleanup.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of improving code quality rather than fixing a critical issue. As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, and code quality improvements are not accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Instead, this patch seems to be adding functionality to parse out the ECC (Error Correction Code) information for full-id NAND chips. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes some local functions and replaces them with existing helper functions. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a parameter from the function s_cbFillTxBufHead in the vt6655 driver. The patch replaces the usage of the parameter *pPacket with the locally available skb->data.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the mfd_cell array const. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple modification that adds the const qualifier to the mfd_cell structure.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch implements the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations for the vb2 queue in the uvcvideo driver. While this change may improve the functionality of the driver, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability by changing the return type of the function `is_file_hugepages()` from `int` to `bool`.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an interface to get the DMA frame and instruction buffer (IB) size for the amdgpu ring. This can be useful for properly calculating space on the ring for IB submissions.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for an existing issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "__always_unused" attribute to the "filter_mask" parameter in the "i40e_ndo_bridge_getlink" function. This attribute is used to indicate that the parameter is intentionally unused and should not trigger any warnings or errors during compilation.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an acknowledgment of the TX done interrupt in "level mode" for the nps_enet driver. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an endian bug in the cpufreq cooling code. The bug causes incorrect values to be stored in the high bits of an unsigned long on big endian systems, resulting in very high values instead. 

The patch changes the data type of the "count" variable from unsigned long to unsigned int to ensure correct storage of values on big endian systems. It also updates the function call to "get_property" to pass the address of the "count" variable directly, without casting it to an unsigned int pointer.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes a global variable and moves it into a configuration function.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is adding soft reset controller support for the STiH415 and includes new softreset lines required for other device tree nodes in the header file. 

However, without further information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical problem. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if the patch contains any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.) that should be excluded from consideration.

Please provide more information about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch, and whether it contains any trivial fixes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of the hash function in the sch_fq.c file.
2. The patch replaces the existing hash_32() function with hash_ptr() for 64-bit architectures.
3. The reason for this change is to improve the entropy on 64-bit architectures with large amounts of memory and avoid unnecessary type casting.
4. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and Cc'd to Hugh Dickins.
5. The patch is also signed-off by David S. Miller.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be an optimization to improve performance on specific architectures.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the greybus driver for the arche-apb controller. In the current code, if devm_gpio_request() fails to request a GPIO, the code proceeds to set the direction of the same GPIO. This is incorrect behavior because if the GPIO request fails, it should not be used further.

The patch fixes this issue by adding an else block to handle the case when devm_gpio_request() fails. In this case, a warning message is printed, indicating the failure to request the GPIO. The subsequent code to set the direction of the GPIO is skipped.

This patch fixes a potential issue where the driver could attempt to use a GPIO that was not successfully requested, which could lead to undefined behavior or system instability.

The patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause system instability or errors. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "fuse: use file_inode() in fuse_file_fallocate()". This suggests that it aims to modify the "fuse_file_fallocate()" function in the "fs/fuse/file.c" file.

2. Looking at the patch itself, we can see that it modifies the line where the "inode" variable is assigned. The original code uses "file->f_inode" to assign the "inode" variable, while the patch replaces it with "file_inode(file)".

3. The "file_inode()" function is a helper function that retrieves the inode associated with a given file. This function is defined in the Linux kernel and is commonly used to access the inode of a file.

4. The purpose of this patch seems to be to replace the direct access to "file->f_inode" with the helper function "file_inode(file)" in the "fuse_file_fallocate()" function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that replaces direct access to a file's inode with a helper function. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, which is not suitable for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops in the tps65023-regulator.c driver. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only makes the struct and ops const, which is a trivial change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Title: "ath9k: Check beaconing mode properly"
   The patch title suggests that the patch is intended to fix an issue related to beaconing mode in the ath9k driver.

2. Patch Description:
   The patch description mentions that in MCC (Multiple Concurrent Channels) mode, the TSF (Timing Synchronization Function) of a context needs to be adjusted only if it is GO/AP (Group Owner/Access Point).

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - Line 260: A new check is added to verify if the previous channel's switch_after_beacon flag is not set. If it is not set, the function returns without adjusting the TSF delta.
   - The rest of the code remains the same.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to beaconing mode in the ath9k driver. It introduces a check to ensure that the TSF delta is adjusted only when the previous channel's switch_after_beacon flag is set. This check helps in preventing unnecessary TSF adjustments in certain scenarios.

   Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or correctness improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

   Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further analysis and input from the maintainers and community experts may be necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward update to the sched_clock interface in the ARM OMAP platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch updates the sched_clock interface from a 32-bit function to a 64-bit function. This is done to align with the recent upgrade of the 32-bit sched_clock interface to support 64 bits. This change allows for the removal of the 32-bit registration interface.

2. The patch includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. In the code changes, the function omap_32k_read_sched_clock is modified to return a 64-bit value (u64) instead of a 32-bit value (u32).

4. The setup_sched_clock function call is replaced with sched_clock_register, passing the updated omap_32k_read_sched_clock function, a 32-bit shift value, and a 32768 Hz frequency.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is a valid and necessary update to the ARM OMAP platform to align with the changes in the sched_clock interface. It does not appear to fix any critical bugs, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It seems more appropriate for inclusion in the next regular kernel release or a specific platform update.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed by the kernel's resource management framework. This helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

2. The patch replaces the manual allocation of memory using kzalloc with devm_kzalloc, which automatically handles memory deallocation when the device is removed. This ensures proper resource management and avoids potential memory leaks.

3. The error handling in the probe function has been improved. Previously, if memory allocation failed, the code would print a warning message and return -ENOMEM. Now, it returns -ENOMEM directly, which is the correct behavior.

4. The error handling in the probe function has also been improved for the case where sysfs_create_group fails. Previously, it would print a warning message and jump to the thermal_error1 label, which would free the allocated memory. Now, it returns the error code directly, which is the correct behavior.

5. The error handling in the probe function has been improved for the case where hwmon_device_register fails. Previously, it would print a warning message, jump to the thermal_error2 label, and free the allocated memory. Now, it returns the error code directly, which is the correct behavior.

6. The remove function has been updated to properly unregister the hwmon device and remove the sysfs group before returning.

Overall, this patch improves resource management, error handling, and code simplicity. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary function call. The patch removes the second call to the function "i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()" in the "do_cmd" function of the "adl_pci9111" driver.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a lockdep_assert_held() call in the fence_signal_locked() function of the dma-buf/fence.c file. This lockdep_assert_held() call is used to verify that the lock associated with the fence object is held when the function is called.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the camellia module to camellia_generic. This change allows optimized assembler implementations to autoload with module-alias.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch modifies the default RSS (Receive Side Scaling) table distribution over the rings of the close NUMA node, enforcing a preference for close rings over far ones.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the use of typedef ctl_table to struct ctl_table. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new definitions for ATPX in the AMDGPU driver. These definitions include ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

From the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug, or if it addresses any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it is not mentioned if this patch contains any trivial fixes.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch (NAK) until more details are provided regarding its significance and impact on the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential deadlock issue related to memory reclaim and workqueue flushing. The patch introduces a new function called "check_flush_dependency" which verifies that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items when memory reclaim is in progress.

The patch also includes a call to "check_flush_dependency" in the "flush_workqueue" function to ensure that the dependency is checked before flushing the workqueue.

Considering the patch addresses a potential deadlock issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the FPU type for ColdFire MMU platforms. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple configuration change that sets the FPU type appropriately for the platform.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the rtsx_probe() function in the rtsx.c file of the staging driver for the rts5208 device.

2. The issue is related to an invalid use of sizeof() in the code. The patch correctly points out that when sizeof() is applied to a pointer typed expression, it gives the size of the pointer, not the size of the pointed data.

3. The patch replaces the incorrect usage of sizeof(dev->chip) with sizeof(*dev->chip). This change ensures that the correct size of the pointed data is allocated.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the history of the bug fix.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect memory allocation and data corruption. The fix is non-trivial and addresses a specific issue in the code.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `handle_IRQ` with `handle_domain_irq` in the `sa1100_handle_irq` function. This change is aimed at automatically mapping the hardware IRQ number to a virtual IRQ (virq).

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to debug logs in the Bluetooth subsystem. The issue is that the expected and actual key count values were mixed up in the debug logs. The patch corrects this by swapping the values in the log messages.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a minor issue related to debug logs. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Based on the criteria provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the tas5086 codec driver. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being addressed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.) as per the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Please provide more information about the bug and any other relevant details so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a configuration option related to DMA in the addi-data drivers. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `comedi_driver_unregister()` function in the staging/comedi/drivers.c file.

2. The change replaces the call to `comedi_dev_from_minor()` with `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver.

3. The purpose of this change is to increment the reference count of the device to prevent it from being removed while it is being checked to see if it is attached to the driver.

4. After the check is performed, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to device removal while it is being checked for attachment to the driver. This could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a generic compatible string for the "hix5hd2" SoC name. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters in the cxgb4 driver. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be adding support for new hardware.

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not fixing a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the onyx and tas codec drivers to use the `module_i2c_driver()` macro. This change makes the code smaller and simpler, but it does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics in the amdgpu driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a call to the function `xgpu_ai_mailbox_set_irq_funcs(adev)` in the `soc15_common_early_init` function. This indicates that the patch is implementing a new feature related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics. This does not seem to fix any critical bug or issue, so it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

2. The patch adds a new function `soc15_common_late_init` which is called in the `late_init` field of the `amd_ip_funcs` structure. This function calls `xgpu_ai_mailbox_get_irq(adev)` if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` is true. Again, this does not fix any critical bug or issue, so it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

3. The patch adds a call to `xgpu_ai_mailbox_add_irq_id(adev)` in the `soc15_common_sw_init` function, which is called during software initialization. Similar to the previous additions, this does not fix any critical bug or issue, so it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

4. The patch adds a call to `xgpu_ai_mailbox_put_irq(adev)` in the `soc15_common_hw_fini` function, which is called during hardware finalization. Again, this does not fix any critical bug or issue, so it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Based on the analysis, it is clear that the patch does not fix any critical bug or issue, and it only adds new functionality related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the changes in the patch are related to code cleanup rather than addressing any functional or critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch reorders the fields in the `struct i915_params` in the `i915_drv.h` file. This change does not introduce any functional changes or fix any bugs directly.

2. The reordering of fields does not create any holes in the structure, ensuring efficient memory usage.

3. The patch also moves the `enable_hangcheck` and `fastboot` fields to the end of the structure, leaving the boolean variables at the end to avoid creating holes. This is a good practice for maintaining structure alignment and memory efficiency.

4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only improves the structure layout and memory efficiency, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue where the mcb_pci_probe() function incorrectly returns zero instead of an error code on the error path. This issue was found by the Linux Driver Verification project.

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - No, the patch does not fix a bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

2. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would conclude that this patch should not be accepted in a Linux -stable release (NAK). While it may be a valid fix for the missing register setting, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address a critical bug or contain any non-trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by replacing `(drm_class == NULL) || (IS_ERR(drm_class))` with `IS_ERR_OR_NULL(drm_class)`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a cosmetic change aimed at improving code readability.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, which is not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my analysis would be (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op, ensuring that all the callers put the open stateid after use. This step is necessary for the removal of client_mutex.

2. The patch includes a FIXME comment suggesting that the atomic_inc operation should be moved into nfs4_preprocess_seqid_op. This indicates that there might be a potential improvement or optimization to be made in the code.

3. The patch modifies the nfsd4_open_downgrade function by adding a goto statement to the put_stateid label when certain conditions are met. This change ensures that the stateid is properly released before exiting the function.

4. The patch also modifies the nfsd4_lock function by introducing a new variable open_stp and adding a call to nfs4_put_stid for open_stp when necessary. This change ensures that the stateid is properly released in case of an error.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses some issues related to reference counting and proper stateid handling. However, it does not fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the patch includes a FIXME comment, indicating that there might be room for further improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a whitespace cleanup and symbol visibility change in the `drivers/crypto/dcp.c` file. It makes the `global_dev` symbol static and changes the visibility of two functions, `dcp_dma_unmap` and `dcp_watchdog`, to static as well.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only contains trivial fixes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the 'data' parameter in the fsnotify() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch is fixing a bug related to the `clk_round_rate()` function in the blackfin architecture.

2. The current implementation of `clk_round_rate()` returns a negative error code upon an error. However, the patch suggests changing it to return 0 instead. This change is necessary because `clk_round_rate()` is being modified to return an unsigned type, and some clock sources can generate rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to update the return value of `clk_round_rate()` from `-EIO` to `0`.

4. The patch includes the appropriate sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the mpl3115 driver in the iio subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds claim/release helper functions to ensure that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads. This indicates that it addresses a specific issue related to direct mode handling.

2. The patch includes the necessary locking mechanism to prevent race conditions when accessing the device.

3. The patch checks for errors during the read operations and handles them appropriately by breaking out of the switch statement.

4. The patch returns the appropriate error code when encountering an invalid channel type.

5. The patch uses the iio_device_claim_direct_mode and iio_device_release_direct_mode functions to claim and release direct mode, respectively.

6. The patch returns the correct value (ret) after performing the necessary operations.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to direct mode handling in the mpl3115 driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to be a valid and necessary improvement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup of error codes in the hv.c file in the staging directory. The patch changes the return values from -1 to specific error codes, such as -EMSGSIZE and -ENOMEM.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue of dropped characters at close in the sierra USB serial driver.

Considering these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver. This member is no longer used and can be determined from the cmd->stop_src instead.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the libcfs_ioctl() prototype in the staging/lustre code. The patch changes the second argument of the libcfs_ioctl() function from "void *arg" to "void __user *arg". 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Since the patch only modifies the prototype of the libcfs_ioctl() function, it does not appear to fix any real and critical bug or address any of the mentioned issues. It seems to be a trivial fix related to the function's argument type.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only introduces a local variable `ops` to store `rdev->desc->ops` and uses it in subsequent code blocks.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property in the opal rtc driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the powergating logic in the AMDGPU driver for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU family. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code." It suggests that the patch aims to improve the power management code for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block on CI GPUs.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line from Rex Zhu and an "Ack-by" line from Tom St Denis, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. The patch also includes a "Reviewed-by" line from Alex Deucher, further indicating that the patch has been reviewed by an experienced developer.

4. The patch modifies the function `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` in the `ci_dpm.c` file.

5. In the modified function, there is a conditional statement that checks whether the `gate` parameter is true or false.

6. If `gate` is true, the patch stops the UVD block by calling `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` with the `AMD_PG_STATE_GATE` state, and then calls `ci_update_uvd_dpm` with the `gate` parameter.

7. If `gate` is false, the patch un-gates the UVD block by calling `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` with the `AMD_PG_STATE_UNGATE` state, and then calls `ci_update_uvd_dpm` with the `gate` parameter.

8. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to powergating the UVD block on CI GPUs. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, it appears to be a targeted fix for the power management logic. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the stability and functionality of the AMDGPU driver for CI GPUs.
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames a function in the staging driver for the rtl8192e device, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is simply a renaming of a function to align with the naming schema used in other rtlwifi devices.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function "add_pcie_port" to "dra7xx_add_pcie_port" in the PCI driver for the dra7xx platform. This change is made to avoid potential collisions in the global namespace.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new feature to the DRM Radeon driver for the Cayman GPU. The patch implements the ability to force a performance level via sysfs. 

Analyzing the patch, it seems to be introducing a new function called `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` in the `ni_dpm.c` file. This function allows the user to set a forced performance level for the Cayman GPU. It takes the `radeon_device` structure and an `enum radeon_dpm_forced_level` as parameters. The function then performs different actions based on the specified level, such as sending messages to the SMC (System Management Controller) to set enabled and forced levels.

Additionally, the patch modifies the `radeon_asic.c` and `radeon_asic.h` files to include the new function in the Cayman ASIC structure and provide a declaration for the function in the header file.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is adding a new feature rather than fixing a critical bug or addressing a security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for encoding the `flags` field in the `ceph_osd_op` structure. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being addressed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any unnecessary changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and any relevant details, so that I can provide a more accurate analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the necessary Kconfig entry to enable the MODULE_TX28 configuration option. This option selects various platform-specific features, including MXS_HAVE_PLATFORM_MXS_MMC. This indicates that the patch is adding support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. This is a functional change and not a trivial fix.

2. The patch also adds a struct mxs_mmc_platform_data variable named tx28_mmc0_pdata, which contains platform-specific data for the MXS MMC device. This includes the wp_gpio and flags fields. The wp_gpio field is set to -EINVAL, indicating that the write-protect GPIO pin is not used. The flags field is set to SLOTF_4_BIT_CAPABLE, indicating that the device supports 4-bit data transfer. These values are specific to the mach-tx28 platform and are not trivial changes.

3. The patch modifies the tx28_stk5v3_init() function to call mx28_add_mxs_mmc() with the appropriate arguments to initialize the MXS MMC device. This ensures that the device is properly initialized during system startup. This is a functional change and not a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that this patch adds support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the MIPS PNX8550 platform. The warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization data annotation for the `arcs_cmdline` variable in the `prom_getcmdline()` function.

The patch adds the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function, which suggests that this function is only used during the initialization phase. This annotation helps ensure that the function and its associated data are placed in the appropriate memory section.

Considering the patch addresses a section mismatch warning, which can potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect execution, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "Staging: hv: Properly handle the error in hv_acpi_init()"
   The patch title suggests that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function in the staging/hv/vmbus_drv.c file.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including K. Y. Srinivasan, Haiyang Zhang, Hank Janssen, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and approval by these individuals.

3. Patch Content:
   The patch modifies the hv_acpi_init() function. Previously, the function would return the error code from vmbus_bus_init(irq) without unregistering the ACPI driver if an error occurred. The patch adds error handling code to properly unregister the ACPI driver in case of an error.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function. This fix ensures that the ACPI driver is properly unregistered in case of an error during vmbus_bus_init(irq). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

   Considering the nature of the patch, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an error handling issue, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

   Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the error handling behavior in the hv_acpi_init() function.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file of the hwmon subsystem. The patch modifies some macros for consistency and to improve code readability.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and it only addresses smatch warnings, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `list_tail_entry()` with `list_last_entry()` in the `zbud_reclaim_page()` function in `mm/zbud.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to keep a list of virtual interfaces (vifs) associated with the hardware (wl12xx). The patch includes modifications to the `wl12xx_init_vif_data`, `wl1271_op_add_interface`, `__wl1271_op_remove_interface`, and `wl1271_alloc_hw` functions, as well as the `wl12xx_vif` structure and related macros.

This patch does not seem to fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be adding a feature to maintain a list of vifs, which may be useful for future development or management purposes. However, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not fix any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the clock data for OMAP4. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any significant functionality or performance improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a critical bug. The patch addresses the issue of interface enumeration failure in the greybus driver. It deactivates the interface immediately upon failure and logs an error message. 

The patch also includes error handling code to handle the failure cases. If the interface activation or enabling fails, it jumps to the appropriate error handling label to deactivate the interface and add it to the greybus interface list.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that could potentially lead to interface issues and data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the mask defines for certain registers in the WM8900 codec driver. It removes the bitwise NOT operation on some mask defines and updates the mask values accordingly.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only makes minor changes to the mask defines, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The change simply replaces the hardcoded return value of -ENODEV with the variable num_entries. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend it to be rejected for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance as it does not address a real and critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unnecessary use of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` function. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `spin_lock_init()` function call after the error checking for the `kmalloc()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of pr_err/info functions with dev_err/info functions in the cpufreq driver for Exynos processors. The purpose of this change is to display accurate log messages with the device name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the code from using `clk_get()` to `devm_clk_get()` in the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function.
2. The `clk_get()` function is used to obtain a reference to a clock specified by the device and clock name.
3. The `devm_clk_get()` function is a managed version of `clk_get()`, which automatically releases the clock resource when the device is unregistered.
4. The patch also removes the `clk_put()` call in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that replaces `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()` and removes the `clk_put()` call. These changes do not fix a real and critical bug, nor do they address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes do not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that marks two functions as static in the exofs/ore_raid.c file. The functions are not used outside of this file, and marking them as static eliminates warning messages about missing prototypes.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for interrupt mode at the start of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the function is only executed when the interrupt mode is enabled. This is a valid optimization to avoid unnecessary execution in non-MSI-X mode.

2. The patch also adds a validation check for ring count changes. If the ring count is not going to change, the validation is skipped. This is another optimization to avoid unnecessary validation when the ring count remains the same.

3. The patch includes a check for `QLCNIC_MSIX_ENABLED` flag to ensure that RSS/TSS support is available in MSI-X mode. If the flag is not set, an error message is printed, and the function returns with `-EINVAL`. This check ensures that the function is only executed when the necessary support is available.

4. The patch modifies the validation check for `rx_count` and `tx_count`. Instead of checking if the counts are non-zero, it now checks if the counts are different from the current driver ring counts (`drv_sds_rings` and `drv_tx_rings` respectively). If the counts are different, the validation is performed, and the driver ring counts are updated accordingly.

5. The patch removes the validation checks for RSS/TSS support in INT-x and MSI modes from `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function in `qlcnic_main.c`. These checks are no longer necessary as the validation is now performed in `qlcnic_set_channels()`.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to optimize the ring count validations and improve the handling of interrupt modes. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only removes unnecessary messages. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the bcm_sf2 driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description states that it fixes a small piece of code that was left untouched during the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use b53_common. This indicates that it addresses a bug or an issue in the code.

2. The "Fixes" tag references a specific commit (f458995b9ad8) that introduced the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use the core B53 driver. This suggests that the patch is intended to correct a problem introduced by that commit.

3. The patch modifies the code in the bcm_sf2_port_setup function by replacing the usage of a local copy of the port_vlan_ctl bitmask value with the one maintained by b53_device. This change ensures that the correct and up-to-date value is used.

4. The change is specific to the bcm_sf2 driver and does not appear to have any impact on other parts of the kernel.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug or issue in the bcm_sf2 driver and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a memory leak issue in the docg3 driver for MTD (Memory Technology Devices).

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the error handling path in the `doc_probe_device` function.

3. In the original code, if the `chip_id` is not equal to its bitwise inverse, the code jumps to the `nomem3` label, which leads to memory deallocation and returning from the function.

4. The patch changes the `goto nomem3` statement to `goto nomem4` in two places.

5. The `nomem4` label is added, and it frees the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt` using `kfree`.

6. Finally, the `nomem3` label is reached, where memory allocated for `mtd` is freed using `kfree`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a memory leak issue by properly freeing the allocated memory in the error path. The change is not a trivial fix, as it addresses a real issue that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p-jpeg driver. The lack of spin_lock protection can potentially lead to race conditions and data corruption. 

The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to the s5p_jpeg_device_run and s5p_jpeg_runtime_resume functions, respectively. These functions modify device registers and should be protected by spin_locks to ensure proper synchronization.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces "x != NULL" with "x". This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to the ppc4xx_edac_match table. This macro is used to generate the module alias information for the OF platform driver, enabling module autoloading.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix SGL Initialization and posting Pages for Dual Chute". It suggests fixing the initialization of the Scatter-Gather List (SGL) and related page posting for the chute.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the file "be_main.c" in the "drivers/scsi/be2iscsi" directory. It makes changes to the functions "beiscsi_post_pages" and "beiscsi_init_sgl_handle".

3. Analysis of Changes:
   - In the function "beiscsi_post_pages", the patch adds a loop to iterate over the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers. It checks if each ULP is supported and breaks the loop when a supported ULP is found. This change seems to be related to the initialization of the SGL and page posting based on the ULP configuration.
   - In the same function, the patch modifies the calculation of the "page_offset" variable, which is used to determine the starting offset of the SGL in memory. The calculation now uses the ULP number obtained from the previous loop.
   - In the function "beiscsi_init_sgl_handle", the patch adds a similar loop to iterate over the ULP numbers. It checks if each ULP is supported and breaks the loop when a supported ULP is found. This change seems to be related to the initialization of the SGL handle.
   - The patch also introduces a new variable "ulp_icd_start" to store the value of "phba->fw_config.iscsi_icd_start[ulp_num]". This variable is then used in the calculation of the "psgl_handle->sgl_index" variable.

4. Analysis Conclusion:
   Based on the provided patch, it seems to address a specific issue related to the initialization of the SGL and page posting for the chute. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

   As an AI, I cannot make a definitive decision without more information. It would be best to consult with the Linux kernel maintainers or the patch author to gather more details about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug, nor does it fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch seems to be adding additional conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the `map_voltage` function call to the `mc13892_sw_regulator_ops` structure in the `mc13892-regulator.c` file. This change is intended to use the `regulator_map_voltage_ascend` function for the `mc13892_sw1` and `mc13892_sw` voltage tables.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. The flag is called "allow_runtime_pm" and is set to true for specific devices.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about a bug or issue that it aims to fix. It only adds a flag for runtime PM support.

Without further context or information about the bug or issue that this patch addresses, it is difficult to determine its significance. Therefore, based solely on the provided patch, it is not possible to make a conclusive decision.

However, if there is additional information available about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix, it would be helpful in making a more informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the drm/i915 driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch is reviewed and signed-off by Imre Deak and Zhao Yakui, who are both from Intel. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review and testing.

2. The patch modifies the gen8_gt_irq_handler() function in the i915_irq.c file.

3. The change in the patch adds support for handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring (VCS2) in addition to the first BSD ring (VCS1). This is done by checking the master_ctl bitmask for GEN8_GT_VCS2_IRQ and notifying the corresponding ring if the GT_RENDER_USER_INTERRUPT flag is set.

4. The patch also includes the necessary register reads and writes to handle the interrupt correctly.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functionality and modifies existing code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an uninitialized return variable in the function `request_code_segment()` in the `ft1000_download.c` file of the `ft1000` driver in the staging directory.

2. The issue occurs when the argument `boot_case` is false, and the return variable is used uninitialized.

3. The patch modifies the code by assigning the return value of the `write_blk_fifo()` function to the `status` variable when `boot_case` is false.

4. Additionally, when `ft1000dev->usbboot` is equal to 1, the patch modifies the code to use the `status` variable with the `ft1000_write_dpram16()` function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch fixes a bug where the return variable is used uninitialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or potential issues. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption or other problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates clock IDs in the Rockchip RK3288 clock driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the allocation of requests in the blk-mq-sched module. The patch checks for successful allocation before assigning a tag to the request.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses a potential issue in the allocation of requests, which could lead to incorrect assignment of tags.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the naming of a device tree property for the extcon-arizona driver. The patch adds the "-ms" suffix to the "wlf,micd-timeout" property to indicate that the timeout value is specified in milliseconds.

Since this patch only involves a naming update and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce.

2. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - Line 342: The initial jack status update is modified to schedule a delayed work using the `schedule_delayed_work` function, passing the debounce time as the delay.

3. Analysis:
   - Purpose: The patch aims to address the issue of hardware initialization and debounce by delaying the initial jack detect.
   - Bug Fix: The patch does not explicitly mention any specific bug or issue it is fixing.
   - Criticality: The patch does not address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a redundant definition for the `pgprot_writecombine` macro. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that hardcodes the clock event rating for the CMT driver to 125. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or a whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `snd_array_new` in the file `sound/pci/hda/hda_codec.c`. The purpose of this function is to allocate memory for an array used in the ALSA HDA (High Definition Audio) driver.

The patch replaces the explicit `memset` call with a reallocation using `krealloc` with the `GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO` flags. This change ensures that the newly allocated memory is zero-initialized, eliminating the need for the explicit `memset` call.

The patch does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential issue with memory allocation and initialization. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a potential issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to reading the CPUID(1).EAX leaf on the correct CPU for AMD microcode. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes and is focused on ensuring the correct CPU is used for the microcode search.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to missing return statements in the nl802154_add_llsec_key() function. The patch adds a missing return statement to handle the case where certain attributes are not present, returning -EINVAL.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or security issues, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used in the msi-available-ranges property. The patch modifies the code in the fsl_msi_setup_hwirq() and fsl_of_msi_probe() functions.

The change in the fsl_msi_setup_hwirq() function sets the cascade_data->index to the offset value instead of offset + irq_index. This change ensures that the correct index is assigned to cascade_data.

In the fsl_of_msi_probe() function, the patch adds a check for the availability of the p variable. If p is not available, it assigns the all_avail variable to p and updates the len variable accordingly.

Additionally, the patch modifies the fsl_msi_setup_hwirq() function call in the fsl_of_msi_probe() function by adding the offset + j value instead of just offset. This change ensures that the correct offset is used when setting up the hardware IRQ.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index and improves the handling of multiple MSI ranges. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, and it does not involve spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the platform name from "omap-pcm-audio" to "omap-mcbsp.2" in the n810_dai structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync()` before enabling and disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin in the `wm8958_mic_detect()` function of the `wm8994.c` file.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a minor change that ensures synchronization of DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) when enabling or disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a sparse warning. The warning itself does not indicate a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the fix does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing function call. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to modify the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq` from `unsigned int` to `int`. The reason for this change is that the function may eventually return a negative error code.

In terms of the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix related to the return type of a function.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming two functions in the powerpc/ps3 code. The functions being renamed are "modify_repository_node_value" and "remove_repository_node", which are being changed to "write_repository_node" and "delete_repository_node" respectively.

Since this patch only involves renaming functions and does not fix any real or critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the error-handling code of `nes_reg_user_mr()` function in `nes_verbs.c`. 

The purpose of `ib_umem_release()` is to release the resources associated with an `ib_umem` object. It is typically called when an error occurs or when the object is no longer needed. 

In this patch, the call to `ib_umem_release()` is added after the `ib_copy_from_udata()` function call, which checks if the copy from user space was successful. If the copy fails, the function returns with an error, and the `ib_umem` object is released before returning the error pointer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that adds missing cleanup code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes two lines of code. The lines being removed are setting the current x and y counts to zero. 

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical issue. However, based solely on the information provided, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the Intel(R) Trace Hub PCI ID for Broxton SOC. This patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling the "usb_put_dev" function. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a space before parentheses, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. This patch is simply a whitespace cleanup, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes that should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary calls to usb_get_dev and usb_put_dev functions in the usbpn_probe and usbpn_disconnect functions of the cdc-phonet USB network driver.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and it only removes trivial code, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused constant, OZ_MAX_TIMER_POOL_SIZE. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the email address of the author in the MODULE_AUTHOR field. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate "const" declaration in the ASoC wm8804 driver. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." as mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses an uninitialized variable issue in the netpoll_setup function in net/core/netpoll.c. The issue was reported by Fengguang Wu, and the patch is signed-off by Cong Wang and David S. Miller.

The patch adds the initialization of the 'err' variable to -EINVAL in the !CONFIG_IPV6 case. This ensures that 'err' is properly initialized before being used in the error handling code.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a warning about a potentially uninitialized variable, which falls under the category of a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the allocation of a local variable and removing an unnecessary if statement. This patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the contrast value in the wm8505 framebuffer driver. The original commit had a typo where the contrast value was set to 0x80 instead of 0x08. The patch corrects this by setting the contrast value to 0x10 based on feedback from an end user.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that does not address any significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the mx6quad variant of the ARM architecture. The patch adds a check to avoid a warning message on the mx6solo variant when attempting to disable the 1.2 GHz OPP (Operating Performance Point).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific warning message related to the mx6solo variant.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in a Linux -stable release (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to clear the hidden CPU state at reset time in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch itself is relatively small and straightforward. It adds a line of code that sets the `vcpu->arch.hflags` value to 0 during the reset of a KVM virtual CPU. This change ensures that the hidden CPU state is properly cleared.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

In this case, the patch does not explicitly mention any specific bug or issue it addresses. However, it is mentioned that the need for this change was noticed during the review of the system management mode implementation by Radim. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue being addressed.

Given the limited information provided, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a critical bug or addresses a significant issue. Additionally, the change itself is relatively trivial, as it only sets a variable to 0. Therefore, based on the information available, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further information or context about the bug being addressed could potentially change this assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for reporting whether the interrupt was handled or not in the tda998x driver. The patch introduces a new variable "handled" and sets it to false initially. If certain conditions are met, such as finding nothing to do or a change in HPD (Hot Plug Detect), the "handled" variable is set to true. Finally, the return value of the interrupt handler is set to IRQ_RETVAL(handled), which will return IRQ_NONE if the interrupt was not handled and IRQ_HANDLED if it was.

Considering the patch's purpose is to improve error handling and prevent the kernel from locking up, it addresses a potential issue that could lead to a hang. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only converts the code to use the new irq_alloc/free_hwirq interface without any functional change. Additionally, there are no indications of any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues being fixed.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch converts the i2c core to use the common attach/detach functions for PM domains, extending the support to include the generic PM domain as well. This indicates a change in the power management behavior of the i2c bus.

2. The patch is signed-off by Ulf Hansson, reviewed by Kevin Hilman, and acked by Wolfram Sang. It is also reviewed by Dmitry Torokhov and signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki.

3. In the code changes, the previous ACPI-specific power management functions `acpi_dev_pm_attach` and `acpi_dev_pm_detach` are replaced with the generic power management functions `dev_pm_domain_attach` and `dev_pm_domain_detach`.

4. The `i2c_device_probe` function is modified to use `dev_pm_domain_attach` instead of `acpi_dev_pm_attach`. If the attachment is not deferred (`status != -EPROBE_DEFER`), the driver's `probe` function is called. If the probe fails, `dev_pm_domain_detach` is called.

5. The `i2c_device_remove` function is modified to use `dev_pm_domain_detach` instead of `acpi_dev_pm_detach`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a change in the power management behavior of the i2c bus by extending support to include the generic PM domain. However, there is no indication of a real and critical bug being fixed or any significant issue being addressed. The patch seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the MIPS VPE (Virtual Processing Element) code. It checks if the weak symbol `vpe_run()` is defined or not. If it is not defined (i.e., its value is zero), the patch returns failure early without attempting to load the VPE.

The rationale behind this change is that if `vpe_run` is zero, there is no point in getting a VPE and attempting to load it since it will fail anyway. By exiting early, unnecessary operations are avoided, potentially improving performance and reducing resource usage.

The patch also includes a warning message when `vpe_run` is not defined, providing additional information to aid in debugging.

Overall, this patch addresses a potential issue and improves the efficiency of the VPE code. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "usb: dwc2: host: add function to compare frame index"
   - The patch adds a new function to compare frame indexes used for descriptor lists with 64 entries.

2. Patch Description:
   - The function `dwc2_frame_idx_num_gt` is added to compare frame indexes.
   - The comparison is done modulo FRLISTEN_64_SIZE, accounting for the rollover of the frame number when the maximum index frame number is reached.

3. Acked-by: John Youn <johnyoun@synopsys.com>
   - The patch has been reviewed and approved by John Youn.

4. Signed-off-by: Gregory Herrero <gregory.herrero@intel.com>
   - The patch has been signed off by Gregory Herrero.

5. Signed-off-by: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>, drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.h
   - The patch has been signed off by Felipe Balbi and is related to the `drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.h` file.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds a necessary function to compare frame indexes in the USB DWC2 host driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and could potentially address a critical bug or issue related to frame index comparison.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a deprecated and unused operation related to video-level DV timings in the s5p-tv driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and not suitable for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, my analysis is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for an indentation style issue in the ks7010_sdio.c file. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the dma-range size when the DT attribute is missing. The patch sets the size to dev->coherent_dma_mask + 1 instead of dev->coherent_dma_mask and adds code to check for invalid values of size configured in DT and log an error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to the dma-range size calculation.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake RAPL in the powercap intel_rapl driver. The patch includes the necessary changes to the rapl_ids array to include the Gemini Lake CPU family (INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_GEMINI_LAKE) and uses the existing rapl_defaults_core function for setting up the RAPL defaults.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   No, this patch does not fix a bug. It adds support for a new CPU family, Gemini Lake.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, this patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and splitting of the FPU initialization sequence into two parts: one for system initialization and one for per-CPU initialization. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only replaces the usage of `dev_{get|set}_drvdata` with `spi_{get|set}_drvdata` functions for getting and setting the driver data using `spi_device` instead of `&spi->dev`.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only makes a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a coding style issue. The change replaces the comparison "*rx_p == NULL" with "!*rx_p" in the if statement. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the MODULE_VERSION macro from the carl9170 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of a cleanup or cosmetic change rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a bypass mode for vce3.0 in the amdgpu driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new function called `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` which is responsible for setting the bypass mode for vce3.0. This function takes an `adev` parameter (amdgpu device) and a boolean `enable` parameter.

2. Inside the `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function, it reads the value of `GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `RREG32_SMC` macro and stores it in the `tmp` variable.

3. If the `enable` parameter is true, it sets the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit in the `tmp` variable using the bitwise OR operation. Otherwise, it clears the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit using the bitwise AND operation.

4. Finally, it writes the modified `tmp` value back to the `ixGCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using the `WREG32_SMC` macro.

5. The patch also modifies the `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function. If the `adev`'s `asic_type` is `CHIP_POLARIS10`, it calls the `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function with the `enable` parameter based on the `state` parameter.

6. The patch checks if the `AMD_CG_SUPPORT_VCE_MGCG` flag is set in `adev->cg_flags`. If it is not set, the function returns 0.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds a necessary functionality to set the bypass mode for vce3.0 in the amdgpu driver. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to initializing cl->tokens and cl->ctokens correctly in the htb_change_class function in the sch_htb.c file. The patch converts the values from ticks to nanoseconds using the PSCHED_TICKS2NS macro.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses an issue with incorrect initialization of cl->tokens and cl->ctokens, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior in the HTB queuing discipline. While the severity of the bug is not explicitly mentioned, it can be considered a real issue.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not seem to introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue without introducing any trivial changes or potential issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description: [SCSI] pm80xx: Fix for 32 bit compilation warning
   - The patch aims to fix a compilation warning related to 32-bit systems in the pm80xx SCSI driver.

2. Signed-off-by: Anandkumar.Santhanam@pmcs.com
   - The patch is signed off by Anandkumar.Santhanam, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

3. Signed-off-by: James Bottomley <JBottomley@Parallels.com>, drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_init.c
   - The patch is also signed off by James Bottomley, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

4. Code Changes:
   - Line 424: A typecast is added to the "memvirtaddr" variable to avoid a compilation warning on 32-bit systems.
     - Before: (u64)pm8001_ha->io_mem[logicalBar].memvirtaddr
     - After: (u64)(unsigned long)pm8001_ha->io_mem[logicalBar].memvirtaddr

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a compilation warning on 32-bit systems. It does not fix a critical bug, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any real security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference error in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds a NULL check for the 'match' variable before using it. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference error, which falls under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8940: Convert to table based control and DAPM init." It suggests converting the code to use a table-based control and DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) initialization.

2. The patch is signed-off by Mark Brown and has been acknowledged by Charles Keepax and Jonathan Cameron.

3. The patch modifies the "audio_map" variable name to "wm8940_dapm_routes" and updates the references to it accordingly.

4. The patch removes the "wm8940_add_widgets" function, which adds DAPM widgets and routes, and replaces it with direct initialization of the DAPM widgets and routes in the codec driver structure.

5. The patch also updates the codec driver structure to include the new DAPM widgets and routes.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is primarily a code refactoring and reorganization. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be more of a "trivial" nature, involving code cleanup and reorganization rather than addressing critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "funcs" argument in two functions: drm_fb_cma_alloc() and drm_fbdev_cma_create_with_funcs(). 

Since this patch only adds the "const" qualifier to function arguments, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to add the ability to defer skb (socket buffer) freeing in the net_sched subsystem. It addresses a problem where qdisc (queueing discipline) changes under RTNL (Routing Netlink) protection can cause TX/RX freezes and latency spikes when a large number of skbs need to be dropped.

The patch introduces the following changes:

1. Adds the function `rtnl_kfree_skbs()` to queue skbs for deferred freeing.
2. Modifies `__qdisc_reset_queue()` to use `rtnl_kfree_skbs()` for freeing skbs.
3. Modifies `qdisc_reset_queue()` to use `__qdisc_reset_queue()` for resetting the queue and sets the backlog to zero.
4. Adds the function `rtnl_qdisc_drop()` as an alternative to `qdisc_drop()` when RTNL is held.
5. Modifies `pfifo_fast_reset()` to use `__qdisc_reset_queue()` for resetting the queue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to TX/RX freezes and latency spikes caused by freeing skbs under certain locks. It introduces new functions and modifies existing ones to handle the deferred freeing of skbs.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause performance issues and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to properly starting and stopping the phy device in the mv643xx_eth driver. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption if the phy device is not handled correctly.

The patch adds the necessary calls to phy_start and phy_stop in the port_start and mv643xx_eth_stop functions respectively. These calls ensure that the phy device is properly started and stopped when needed.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that could potentially cause problems in the system. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

However, it is important to note that the patch has already been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Sebastian Hesselbarth, Mugunthan V N, and Florian Fainelli. This further supports the case for accepting the patch.

Therefore, my analysis is that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug or issue. The patch only replaces the calculation of `tmp` with a call to `usb_endpoint_maxp_mult()`. Since this change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which aims to clean up coding style issues in the clk-bcm2835.c file, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only focuses on addressing checkpatch complaints and improving the coding style.

According to the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of "trivial" fixes, as it only deals with coding style issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes a code style warning, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, are not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply replaces the usage of `call->conn->params.peer` with `call->peer` in multiple places within the code. This change is made because `call->conn` may become NULL, and using `call->peer` directly avoids this potential issue.

However, this patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical problems. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or optimization rather than addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a constant from "RSND_GEN2_SRU" to "RSND_GEN2_SCU" in the rcar_snd.h header file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity or consistency purposes.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the file `fs/proc/kcore.c` in the Linux kernel.

2. The change being made is to replace the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy` for copying the `saved_command_line` string into `prpsinfo.pr_psargs`.

3. The reason for this change is to ensure that the destination string is always null-terminated, even if the source string is longer than the destination buffer size.

4. The `strlcpy` function is used with the destination buffer size specified as `sizeof(prpsinfo.pr_psargs)`, which ensures that the copy operation does not exceed the size of the destination buffer.

5. The patch also includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` lines from the authors who made the change.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change addresses a potential issue with string copying and ensures that the destination string is always null-terminated, which can help prevent buffer overflows or other related issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a struct and associated variable names. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the code in the ni_atmio16d driver in the staging directory of the Linux kernel.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `comedi_buf_put()` with `comedi_buf_write_samples()` to add the sample to the async buffer.

3. It introduces a new variable `val` of type `unsigned short`.

4. The value read from the `AD_FIFO_REG` register using `inw()` is assigned to the `val` variable.

5. The `comedi_buf_write_samples()` function is called to write the sample to the async buffer.

6. The `comedi_handle_events()` function is called to handle events for the device.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making a functional change to the code by replacing the usage of `comedi_buf_put()` with `comedi_buf_write_samples()`. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it seems to be more of an aesthetic change rather than addressing a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to selecting only devices with active links in the staging/rdma/hfi1 driver. The patch introduces a new function called `usable_device` which checks if a device is available for general use by verifying if the driver link state is active. 

The patch then modifies the `get_user_context` function to iterate through the available devices and only consider devices that are active and have free contexts. This ensures that only devices with active links are used for user contexts.

Overall, this patch seems to address a specific issue related to device selection and ensures that only devices with active links are used. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that exports the ioremap_nocache function in the CRIS architecture.

false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ASoC: arizona: Ensure we clock two channels for I2S mode"
   - The patch aims to ensure that two channels are clocked for I2S mode, even for mono data.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the "arizona_hw_params" function in the "arizona.c" file.
   - It adds code to force stereo mode for I2S mode if the number of channels is 1.
   - It updates the "bclk_target" value accordingly.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific behavior related to I2S mode in the Arizona ASoC codec driver.
   - It ensures that stereo clocking is used even for mono data in I2S mode.
   - This is important because I2S requires stereo clocking, and not following this requirement could lead to data corruption or other issues.

4. Impact:
   - The patch fixes a potential issue that could cause data corruption or other problems when using I2S mode with mono data.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to I2S mode and ensures proper functionality and data integrity.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug.

Based on the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch addresses a critical bug or meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or maintainers before making a decision. As it stands, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in a stable release (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the detection of certain boards in the MIPS BCM47XX architecture. The patch adds missing entries for specific board types in the `bcm47xx_board_list_hardware_version` array.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it addresses a specific detection issue for certain boards.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to export the I2C module alias information. This change allows udev to auto load the correct module when the device is added.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it is a trivial change that makes the `register_disk()` function static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a sparse warning in the `net/nfc/digital_technology.c` file. The warning suggests that the symbol `digital_tg_send_sensf_res` was not declared and asks if it should be static.

The patch addresses this warning by making the `digital_tg_send_sensf_res` function static. This change restricts the visibility of the function to the current translation unit, which is generally considered good practice unless there is a specific reason for it to be externally visible.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather addresses a sparse warning, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a debug entry for GCA configuration data in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes changes to the amdgpu_device.c file to add the debugfs entry and the corresponding read function.

Additionally, the patch includes some minor changes such as using kmalloc instead of vmalloc and correcting indentation. While these changes are not considered trivial, they do not address any critical issues.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the em28xx-v4l extension in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch moves the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() functions to the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function.

3. The reason for this change is that currently, these functions are only called when the last user closes the device and the device is already disconnected. However, it is stated that this behavior is incorrect, and these functions should be called whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

4. The patch also updates the warning message in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function to reflect the change in behavior.

5. Additionally, the patch removes the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() functions from the em28xx_v4l2_close() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the em28xx-v4l extension and improves the correct behavior by ensuring that the necessary functions are called when the extension is closed.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the declaration of the function `release_uids` is being removed from `sched.h`. The patch also includes an `Acked-by` tag from Serge Hallyn and a `Signed-off-by` tag from Eric W. Biederman.

Since the patch is removing a declaration for a function that does not exist (`release_uids`), it does not fix any real or critical bug. Additionally, it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix, as it only removes a non-existent function declaration.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `clear_shadow_scan`.

false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "[SCSI] qla2xxx: No fcport FC-4 type assignment in GA_NXT response." It suggests a fix for an issue related to the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the qla2x00_ga_nxt() function in the qla_gs.c file. Specifically, it adds a new assignment for the fc4_type field of the fc_port_t structure.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses the issue of missing fcport FC-4 type assignment in the GA_NXT response. It assigns the fc4_type based on the value of the third element in the fc4_types array of the ct_rsp structure. If the third element's BIT_0 is set, the fc4_type is assigned as FC4_TYPE_FCP_SCSI; otherwise, it is assigned as FC4_TYPE_OTHER.

   This fix ensures that the fc4_type field is correctly assigned, which is crucial for proper functioning of the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

4. Criticality:
   Based on the provided information, it is not explicitly mentioned whether this issue causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. However, the patch addresses a specific bug related to the fcport FC-4 type assignment, which can potentially impact the functionality of the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific bug mentioned in the patch description.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). While the criticality of the bug is not explicitly mentioned, the patch addresses a specific issue in the qla2xxx SCSI driver, ensuring correct assignment of the fc4_type field.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the code in the file net/ipv6/ip6_output.c.
2. The change replaces the existing code "if (skb_copy_bits(skb, ptr, skb_transport_header(frag), len)) BUG();" with "BUG_ON(skb_copy_bits(skb, ptr, skb_transport_header(frag), len));".
3. The change replaces the if statement with a BUG_ON macro.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

- The patch replaces an if statement with a BUG_ON macro, which is a more concise and expressive way of expressing the intent.
- The change does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the control flow of the code.
- The patch does not introduce any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.
- The change does not seem to introduce any new bugs or issues.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "dvb_unregister_device". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

However, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or optimization rather than addressing a critical problem.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves release handles into fail labels. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the TWL6030 MFD (Multi-Function Device) driver by introducing the ability to set wake-up functionality for the device's interrupt line. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new feature to the driver. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT on the read syscall path in the perf subsystem. The patch is signed-off by Jiri Olsa and has been acked by Stephane Eranian and Peter Zijlstra.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its impact on the criteria mentioned earlier.

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any bug, but it reverts a check that is considered to break the standard way of reading counters. This suggests that the check was causing issues in the functionality of the perf subsystem.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not mention any of these issues explicitly. However, it is reverting a check that might have been causing issues in reading counters, which could potentially lead to incorrect or unreliable performance measurements.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It is reverting a specific check in the code.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the patch does not explicitly mention a bug or its impact, it reverts a check that is considered to break the standard way of reading counters. This suggests that the check was causing issues in the functionality of the perf subsystem, which can be considered a real and critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the hfi1_query_qp function is being removed from the staging/rdma/hfi1/qp.c file. The function is then no longer being used in the codebase.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an issue that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not provide any information about the reason for removing the hfi1_query_qp function or any associated bug or issue. Without this context, it is difficult to determine the impact of removing this function.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, it is not possible to make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further investigation and clarification are needed to determine the significance and impact of removing the hfi1_query_qp function.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it addresses an issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it is reset.

2. The patch description explains that when the kernel reboots, the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called. However, the buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler. Therefore, the patch proposes not to update the buffer tail if it is reset.

3. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by Sonic Zhang and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

4. In the code changes, the line "xmit->tail = (xmit->tail + uart->tx_count) & (UART_XMIT_SIZE - 1);" is removed from its original position.

5. A new condition is added to check if the circular buffer is not empty before updating the buffer tail and performing further operations.

6. If the condition is met, the buffer tail is updated, and an additional check is performed to determine if there are fewer pending characters than a defined threshold (WAKEUP_CHARS). If so, the uart_write_wakeup function is called.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it is reset, which can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. The patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals, and the code changes appear to be appropriate for fixing the problem.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds support for Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem.

2. Changes Made: The patch adds four new clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2: epit1_ipg_gate, epit1_hf_gate, epit2_ipg_gate, and epit2_hf_gate.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch adds necessary clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2, which indicates that it is addressing a specific hardware support issue.
   - The changes made are not trivial, as they involve adding new clock gates to the existing clock subsystem.
   - The patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.
   - It does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues either.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to updating the scan response data in the Bluetooth management code. The patch updates the correct variables, `scan_rsp_data_len` and `scan_rsp_data`, instead of mistakenly using the advertising data variables.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a non-critical issue related to Bluetooth management.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The original code uses pr_warn to print a warning message when the registration to debugfs fails. However, pr_warn is a generic printk function that does not provide context-specific information. The patch replaces pr_warn with netdev_warn, which is a netdev-specific printk function that includes the network device name in the warning message. This improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve replacing a generic printk function with a netdev-specific printk function. This change enhances the code's functionality and improves the quality of the warning messages.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new bugs, errors, or security vulnerabilities. The patch simply improves the existing code by providing more informative warning messages.

Based on these factors, I believe that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the declaration of the "decon_crtc_ops" structure in the "exynos5433_drm_decon.c" file. This change is aimed at improving code correctness by ensuring that the structure is treated as read-only when passed as an argument to the "exynos_drm_crtc_create" function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the `mask_pos` correctly in the PCI subsystem. The original code incorrectly calculated the value of `mask_pos` based on the `control` and `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` values.

The patch modifies the code to correctly calculate the value of `mask_pos` based on the `control` value. It uses a conditional statement to check if `control` has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set. If it does, `mask_pos` is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, otherwise it is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior in the PCI subsystem, and it does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial update to the version number of the tg3 driver. It does not fix any real or critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the `builtin_platform_driver()` helper. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls outside the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "drm/msm: use drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence." It suggests using the function drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane_state in the msm_atomic_commit() function.

The patch description mentions that drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() is smart and won't overwrite plane_state->fence if the user has already set an explicit fence there. This implies that the patch aims to improve the behavior of setting the fence for the plane_state.

Looking at the code changes, the patch adds a call to drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() after obtaining the msm_obj->resv fence. This function is responsible for setting the fence for the plane_state.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the usage of a variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug or issue. The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT (Device Tree) data, which avoids the need to add clock aliases under specific files.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (code improvement), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivars.c file. The patch addresses a sign issue by changing the variable type from ssize_t to size_t.

The patch itself does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a fix for a potential sign issue, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to newer versions of gcc and variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch addresses the issue by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays directly.

However, the patch does not mention any specific critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue that it fixes. It seems to be more of a code improvement or compatibility fix rather than addressing a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not provide any information about the impact or potential risks associated with the issue it addresses. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue and whether it warrants inclusion in a stable release.

Considering these factors, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further information is provided to demonstrate its criticality and impact on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to debug information display in the mac80211 module. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" debug information outside the mesh_stats debug group, as it is not a statistics member.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to address a sparse warning. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

The addition of locking is aimed at preventing potential race conditions when accessing the `free_vbufs` list, which could lead to issues such as data corruption or hangs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could cause data corruption or hangs, making it a valid candidate for inclusion. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the analysis suggests that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses the non-success return paths where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks in certain scenarios, such as when the card isn't ready after il4965_prepare_card_hw() or when the card is hardware-rfkilled.

The suggested fix is to deallocate the broadcast stations by calling il_dealloc_bcast_stations() in both of these non-success return paths. This ensures that the allocated memory is properly freed before returning an error code or a warning message.

Considering that memory leaks can cause resource exhaustion and potential stability issues, this patch addresses a real and critical bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes, as it focuses on memory management and preventing leaks. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that eliminates the send buffers in the GSI receive QP. This change does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "userns: Convert xenfs to use kuid and kgid where appropriate." This suggests that the patch aims to convert the xenfs filesystem to use kernel user identifiers (kuid and kgid) where necessary.

2. The patch includes changes to the "xenfs_make_inode" function in the "super.c" file. It modifies the initialization of the inode's uid and gid fields. Instead of setting them to 0, it sets them to GLOBAL_ROOT_UID and GLOBAL_ROOT_GID, respectively.

3. The patch also includes changes to the "UIDGID_CONVERTED" configuration option in the "init/Kconfig" file. It removes the dependency on XENFS.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the xenfs filesystem and its handling of user identifiers. However, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new functionality related to pipeline power management in the future. This indicates that it is not fixing an existing critical bug or security issue.

2. The patch also includes a fix for a documentation bug related to a warning message. While documentation bugs are not considered critical, they can still be important for code clarity and maintainability.

3. The patch modifies the `media_device_register_entity` function by re-creating the graph walk object if it is not large enough for all entities in the graph. This ensures that the graph walk object is always sufficient.

4. The patch also adds a cleanup step for the `pm_count_walk` graph walk object in the `media_device_cleanup` function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not fix a critical bug, a security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It introduces a new functionality and includes a documentation bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless conditional branch. The change simply assigns the value of `skb` to `napi->skb` without checking if `skb` is NULL. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to waiting for a BO (Buffer Object) to become idle after a move in ttm_bo_swapout function in ttm_bo.c file.

2. The patch removes the unnecessary wait for the GPU before moving the BO to system cached memory. This change improves the efficiency of the swapout process.

3. After the move to system cached memory, the patch introduces a new step to ensure that the BO is idle before proceeding further. This ensures that any pending operations on the BO are completed before unmap and other operations are performed.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Christian König and Alex Deucher, who are recognized contributors in the Linux kernel community.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical issue related to BO management and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant declarations of functions in the perf/x86/intel/bts driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds support for the AR9580 chipset in the ath9k driver. However, the patch does not provide any specific details about the bug or issue that it addresses. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need more information about the nature of the bug or issue it fixes. Without that information, it is difficult to assess the criticality or severity of the problem being addressed.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases until more details about the bug or issue it fixes are provided.
false || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch removes the 'i8254_osc_base' field from the 'struct pcl816_board' in the pcl816.c file.
2. It also removes the 'i8254_osc_base' initialization from two boardtypes in the 'boardtypes' array.

The 'i8254_osc_base' field is not used anywhere else in the code, and its removal does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a trivial fix, removing an unused field.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. It seems to be a trivial cleanup, removing unused code. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a wait for one vblank before disabling CRCs in the i915 driver. The purpose of this change is to avoid a spurious interrupt warning. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new member `resource` to the `struct drbd_device` in the `drbd_int.h` header file. This member is then assigned a value in the `drbd_create_minor` function in `drbd_main.c` and used in the `drbd_adm_prepare` function in `drbd_nl.c`.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it seems to be a trivial change that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the svcrpc module related to the traversal of the xpt_list during shutdown. The patch introduces spin locks to ensure proper synchronization when accessing the xprt_list.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a locking issue that may not have a significant impact on system stability or security.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a refactoring of the sdhci_init() function in the sdhci driver. It introduces a new function called sdhci_set_default_irqs() and moves some code from sdhci_init() to this new function.

Based on the provided patch, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a code cleanup or refactoring change, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes that should not be included in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of the `led_info` structure in the `leds-pca963x.c` file. The patch initializes the `led` structure completely by using the `{}` initializer, which ensures that all fields are properly initialized.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to uninitialized data and unpredictable behavior, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. However, it does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it only addresses the initialization of a structure. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a helper function called `dwc3_core_fifo_space` to the `dwc3` USB driver. This helper function is used to retrieve the available space in different queues and FIFOs in the `dwc3` controller. The purpose of this helper function is initially for debugging purposes, specifically for dumping space information to debugfs. It is also mentioned that this helper function will be used later for issuing remote wakeup when starting a transfer and there is something in a TX FIFO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? - No, this patch does not appear to fix a bug. It adds a helper function for debugging and potential future use.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? - No, this patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? - No, this patch does not address any security concerns.

4. Does it address an "oh, that's not good" issue? - No, this patch does not seem to address any critical issues.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? - It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend giving it a (B) and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential security issue. The patch reintroduces a check to disallow world-writable files in sysfs. This check was previously removed when the check was unified into VERIFY_OCTAL_PERMISSIONS().

Considering that the patch addresses a real security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a semicolon. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the values of n, m1, and m2 in the FP register for the gma500 driver in the psb_intel_display.c file. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple adjustment of clock limits.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply changes the return type of the `drm_pci_agp_init` function from `int` to `void`. This change is not critical and does not fix any real issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the nf_bridge_info structure in the netfilter bridge code. The patch frees the nf_bridge_info structure after POST_ROUTING, which is only needed for the -m physdev option.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not address any of the mentioned critical issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the Lustre staging driver. It does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes warnings that occur when compiling a 64-bit kernel in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. These warnings are related to pointer-to-integer casts and integer-to-pointer casts of different sizes.

2. The patch introduces a change in the IS_DMA_ALIGNED macro, replacing the previous check with the IS_ALIGNED macro using DMA_ALIGNMENT.

3. The patch also modifies the initialization of the null_dma_buf field in the driver_data structure, using PTR_ALIGN instead of ALIGN.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. The warnings addressed by the patch are related to compiler warnings and do not impact the functionality or stability of the kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to make use of the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of hardcoding it to the bit used by current Tegra GPUs.

2. It adds a new member "iommu_bit" of type u16 to the "struct gk20a_instmem" in the "gk20a.c" file.

3. In the "gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu" function, the patch replaces the hardcoded bit 34 with the "iommu_bit" to clear the IOMMU bit and unmap pages.

4. In the "gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu" function, the patch replaces the hardcoded bit 34 with the "iommu_bit" to set the IOMMU bit and resolve addresses through the IOMMU.

5. In the "gk20a_instmem_new" function, the patch assigns the "iommu_bit" from the platform data to the "iommu_bit" member of "struct gk20a_instmem".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making a necessary change to use the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of a hardcoded value. This change improves flexibility and maintainability.

Considering that the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it seems to be a non-critical fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a "clean-up" rather than addressing a significant issue.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that replaces the module_init and module_exit calls with the module_i2c_driver macro. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the explicit initialization and cleanup functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function callback. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a new function `nvme_free_queue_mem()` to free the memory allocated for the admin queue in case of initialization failure. This function is then called in the `nvme_configure_admin_queue()` function when the initialization fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential memory leak issue, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style warning related to void function return statements. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the function `blkdev_mmap()` as static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the cfg80211 module. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch allows vendor commands that require the WIPHY_VENDOR_CMD_NEED_RUNNING flag to be sent to the NAN (Neighborhood Aware Networking) interface. This indicates that it addresses a specific functionality or behavior related to the NAN interface.

2. The patch includes three signed-off lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by multiple developers from Intel. This suggests that the patch has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

3. In the code changes, there is an addition to the condition for returning -ENETDOWN. Previously, the condition checked for the absence of a network device (wdev->netdev) and the absence of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) started flag (wdev->p2p_started). The patch adds an additional condition to check for the absence of NAN (wdev->nan_started). This change ensures that vendor commands can only be sent to the NAN interface if it is started.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the cfg80211 module and has been reviewed and approved by multiple developers. Additionally, the code changes appear to be logical and necessary to ensure proper functionality of the NAN interface.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for obtaining the BOS (Binary Object Store) descriptor test scenario for USB 3.0 in the usbtest module. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new feature to the usbtest module.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a dentry leak issue in the greybus driver's es2.c file. The patch adds a debugfs_remove() call to properly remove the debugfs file, which was previously missing. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a dentry leak issue, which can be categorized as an "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug and does not introduce any trivial fixes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding stub functions for v_sys, refclk, and unipro resource management in the greybus driver. These stub functions are currently not implemented and return 0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to ensure that tasklets are killed in the edma driver upon exit, preventing them from being executed after the driver is removed. It specifically targets vchan tasklets used in the driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch adds a new function called `edma_cleanupp_vchan` which iterates over the list of channels in the `dma_device` structure and removes each channel's device node from the list. Additionally, it calls `tasklet_kill` to kill the tasklet associated with each channel.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to tasklets in the edma driver. It ensures that tasklets are properly cleaned up upon driver removal, preventing any potential issues that may arise from their execution after removal.

   The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve adding a new function and modifying the `edma_remove` function to call this new function. The patch does not contain any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

   However, without further context or information about the severity of the issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug being addressed is critical or not. Additionally, the patch does not mention any specific build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues being fixed.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, it is not clear whether the bug being fixed by the patch is critical or meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Without more information, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.

   Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation and discussion by the Linux kernel maintainers and experts to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch title: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: fixup FPGA ioremap area"
   - The patch appears to fix an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area on the shmobile bockw board.

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Kuninori Morimoto <kuninori.morimoto.gx@renesas.com> and Simon Horman <horms+renesas@verge.net.au>.

3. Code changes:
   - Line 42: The variable "fpga" is changed from a static variable to a non-static variable.
   - Line 66: The "fpga" variable is unmapped using the iounmap() function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area on the shmobile bockw board. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.).

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in a stable release or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the AXP20X and AXP22X battery drivers to the MFD cells of the AXP209, AXP221, and AXP223 MFDs. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds functionality to support battery drivers for specific PMICs.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of error paths in drivers that use optional clocks by allowing NULL or error pointers to be passed unconditionally. This simplifies the error handling logic in such drivers.

In the function `clk_unprepare()`, the patch checks if the `clk` pointer is NULL or an error pointer using the `IS_ERR_OR_NULL()` macro. If it is, the function returns early, avoiding any further operations.

Similarly, in the function `clk_disable()`, the patch performs the same NULL or error pointer check before proceeding with the disabling of the clock.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It directly addresses a potential issue in the code logic.

Overall, the patch seems to fix a real and critical bug related to error handling in drivers that use optional clocks. It does not introduce any trivial changes and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds definitions for Skylake stepping revision IDs. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." mentioned in the criteria. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "ops" member of the "ds2404" structure. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is simply a constification of a structure that is never modified.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for unregistering the connector during component removal in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds the necessary calls to unregister and cleanup the connector in the `hdmi_connector_destroy` function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a cleanup issue and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for sharing the interrupt handler in the dwc3-omap driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that on OMAPs, OTG events come on the same IRQ, so it is necessary to share this IRQ with the OTG device driver. This suggests that there is a potential issue with handling interrupts in the current implementation.

2. The patch modifies the `dwc3_omap_probe` function in the `dwc3-omap.c` file.

3. Specifically, it modifies the `devm_request_threaded_irq` function call by adding the `IRQF_SHARED` flag as the last argument. This flag indicates that the interrupt handler should be shared with other interrupt handlers on the same IRQ.

4. The patch also updates the error message to include the IRQ number.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to interrupt handling in the dwc3-omap driver. It introduces the necessary changes to share the interrupt handler, which should help in handling OTG events correctly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the pageflip finish event for interlace mode in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs. The bug is related to incorrect checking of the top field vsync due to a comparison between DMA addresses converted by start coordinates and non-converted DMA addresses.

The patch modifies the "mixer_irq_handler" function in the "exynos_mixer.c" file. It introduces changes to compare the base and shadow registers for both graphic bases (0 and 1) in the interlace scan case.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to interlace mode and the incorrect checking of DMA addresses. However, without further context or details about the bug's impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, additional information is needed, such as the severity of the bug, its impact on system stability, potential security implications, and whether it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug. Without this information, I cannot definitively determine whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a flag to indicate that a recovery work was initiated on purpose to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set.

2. The BUG_ON() macro is modified to include an additional condition that checks if the bug_on_recovery flag is set and the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is not set in the wl->flags bitfield.

3. In the wl1271_op_add_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before initiating the recovery work.

4. In the wl1271_op_remove_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before queuing the recovery work.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary fix to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set. It adds a flag to indicate that the recovery work was initiated intentionally, preventing the BUG() from being triggered. This fix addresses a potential issue that could cause a hang or other critical problem.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new sysfs file to show the Latency Tolerance Messaging (LTM) capabilities of USB devices. This is not a critical bug fix or a security issue, but rather an enhancement to provide additional information about USB devices.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being addressed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the netfilter hashlimit module. The patch moves the rateinfo initialization to a helper function called rateinfo_init. This change is done to avoid bloating the main match function.

The patch itself does not seem to fix any critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or code refactoring change rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch adds a new function `dso__last_symbol()` to find the last symbol in a DSO (Dynamic Shared Object). While this enhancement may be useful for certain scenarios, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that made changes to the ARM shmobile emev2 code. The reason for the revert is that the code changes the flags of the wrong CPUs, which breaks the bootup of secondary CPUs.

The patch itself does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address a critical bug that causes the bootup of secondary CPUs to fail. This can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch should be accepted (ACK) because it fixes a critical bug that affects the functionality of the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes deprecated usage of the `cpus_` functions in the `irq_ia64.c` file for the IA64 architecture. The patch replaces the deprecated functions with the corresponding `cpumask_` functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the ACPI device ID array in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple code modification that improves code readability and maintainability by making the ACPI device ID array const.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a numeric value with a defined constant. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a relatively small change to the nve0_fifo_intr function in the nve0.c file of the nouveau driver. The patch introduces a new function called nve0_fifo_intr_engine, which triggers a specific event when a certain condition is met.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, without additional context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.

If this patch is fixing a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other significant issue, then it may be appropriate for inclusion in a stable release. However, if the patch is addressing a relatively minor issue or making a trivial change, such as a spelling correction or whitespace cleanup, it would not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, without more information about the bug or issue being addressed, I cannot make a conclusive determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling `schedule_work()`. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It also does not introduce any functional changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and not suitable for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the i2c-mxs driver. The bug causes the i2cdetect command to scan the i2c bus slowly because the driver ignores the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit during the busy-waiting loop. The patch adds a check for the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit and returns an error if it is set, which improves the speed of the i2cdetect command.

Considering that this patch addresses a real issue that affects the functionality and performance of the i2c-mxs driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error when the mc138xxx driver is built as a module. The error is related to undefined symbols "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" in the mc13892-regulator.ko module.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that addresses a build error when the driver is built as a module.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a whitespace before a parenthesis, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch warning. The change only modifies the formatting of a log message by adding indentation. This does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to scheduling while atomic in the sdhci_s3c_set_clock() function. The patch modifies the driver to cache the rates of all bus clocks at probe time and then only use those cached values, instead of calling clk_get_rate() which might sleep.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes the `ops` structure in the `nand_default_block_markbad`, `nand_read`, `panic_nand_write`, and `nand_write` functions. The patch initializes the `ops` structure using `memset` instead of explicitly setting the `datbuf` and `oobbuf` fields to `NULL`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a line length issue and a blank line issue in the code. The change involves removing a comment and repositioning it to comply with the coding style guidelines.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only fixes the default value of gpio_base when no device tree node exists for a device with CONFIG_OF_GPIO defined. This does not seem to be a critical issue that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "f2fs: detect error of update_dent_inode in ->rename". This suggests that it aims to address an issue related to the update_dent_inode function in the f2fs filesystem's rename operation.

2. The patch adds error checking and handling for the update_dent_inode function call in the f2fs_rename function.

3. In the original code, the return value of update_dent_inode is not checked, and the code proceeds regardless of any potential errors.

4. The patch modifies the code to assign the return value of update_dent_inode to the 'err' variable and then checks if 'err' is non-zero. If an error occurs, the code releases the orphan inode and jumps to the 'put_out_dir' label, indicating a failure.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue by adding error handling for the update_dent_inode function call in the f2fs_rename function. This change ensures that any errors during the update operation are properly detected and handled, improving the overall reliability and stability of the f2fs filesystem.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds support for different MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths. This can be useful for systems that require separate memory regions for transmitting and receiving data.

2. If only one region is specified, it is assumed to be shared between Rx and Tx, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. The patch also assigns the Tx channel to Rx if the MMIO regions are different and Rx is not specified. This ensures that the system can still function properly even if only one channel is specified.

4. The patch modifies the structure `struct mbox_test_device` to include separate `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers for the Tx and Rx MMIO regions, respectively.

5. The `mbox_test_message_write` function is modified to check if `tx_mmio` and `signal` are not NULL before proceeding with sending the message. This ensures that the message is only sent if there is a valid MMIO region and a signal to pass the message through.

6. The `mbox_test_receive_message` function is modified to check if `rx_mmio` is not NULL before copying the received message from the MMIO region to the `rx_buffer`. This ensures that the message is only copied if there is a valid Rx MMIO region.

7. The `mbox_test_prepare_message` function is modified to check if `tx_mmio` is not NULL before copying the message to the Tx MMIO region. This ensures that the message is only copied if there is a valid Tx MMIO region.

8. The `mbox_test_probe` function is modified to handle separate Tx and Rx MMIO regions. It first attempts to map the Tx MMIO region and assigns it to `tx_mmio`. If a second resource entry is specified, it attempts to map the Rx MMIO region and assigns it to `rx_mmio`. If the Rx MMIO mapping fails, it falls back to using the Tx MMIO region for Rx as well.

9. If the Rx channel is not specified but there is an Rx MMIO region, the patch assigns the Rx channel to the Tx channel. This ensures that the system can still function properly even if only one channel is specified.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical issue by adding support for separate Tx and Rx MMIO regions. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a line over 80 characters warning detected by the checkpatch.pl script. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the code. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to passing the wrong value as an argument for PTR_ERR() in the ALSA fireworks driver. The patch correctly assigns the return value of memdup_user() to the 'buf' variable and checks if it is an error using IS_ERR(). However, the current implementation incorrectly passes 'data' instead of 'buf' to PTR_ERR().

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect error handling and behavior in the ALSA fireworks driver. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption, it can be considered a bug that affects the correct functioning of the driver.

Additionally, the fix does not appear to contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch only involves inlining the ATS setup code into the `pci_ats_init()` function, without any functional change.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring patch that breaks up a long function into smaller functions for better code readability. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "_single" suffix from the page table allocator function names. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

So, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the parameter 'dma_mask' to 'max_addr' in the blk_queue_bounce_limit() function. The patch does not introduce any functional changes and is aimed at avoiding misinterpretation of the parameter.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary variable initialization in the `d40_probe()` function of the `ste_dma40` driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the ocfs2 filesystem when calling Q_GETNEXTQUOTA for a filesystem with quotas disabled. The patch checks early whether the filesystem has quotas enabled and returns an error if quotas are not enabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch fixes an issue that causes an oops when calling Q_GETNEXTQUOTA for a filesystem with quotas disabled. This can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the bug causes an oops, which is an undesirable issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that causes an oops.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a change related to ACPI Power Management Timer (PM Timer) in the ACPICA module. The patch makes the PM Timer optional, aligning with ACPI 5.0A specifications.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems that the change does not directly affect Linux because Linux does not rely on the presence of the PM Timer. The patch includes modifications to the `acpi_get_timer` and `acpi_get_timer_duration` functions in `hwtimer.c` file, as well as the `fadt_info_table` and `acpi_tb_validate_fadt` functions in `tbfadt.c` file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optional enhancement aligned with ACPI specifications.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated function `simple_strtoul` with the recommended function `kstrtoul`. This change improves the code by using a more strict function that filters invalid input.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. It is a simple code improvement that does not address any critical problem.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an extra variable declaration. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for whitespace issues in the `spidev_test` file. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch increases the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw module.

2. The patch is signed-off by Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org> and John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>.

3. The patch modifies the ath9k_hw_abort_tx_dma() function in the mac.c file.

4. It introduces a new variable "maxdelay" and initializes it to 1000.

5. If the current channel (ah->curchan) is not NULL, the patch checks if it is a half-rate or quarter-rate channel and adjusts the "maxdelay" accordingly.

6. The patch writes to the AR_Q_TXD register to abort the transmission DMA.

7. It sets various bits in different registers to handle the abort process.

8. It then enters a loop to wait for the abort to complete. The loop iterates "maxdelay" times, with a delay of 5 microseconds between iterations.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be addressing a specific issue related to the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw module. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which reformats pointer variables in the `main.c` file of the `staging/speakup` driver, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only aims to meet kernel coding standards by reformatting the pointer variables.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the driver from "ohci" to "ohci-da8xx" in the davinci ohci driver. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the LM63 hardware monitoring driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds support for the LM64 chip, which has a dedicated pin for tachometer function and always enables fan speed monitoring. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch adds support for the LM64 chip, which has a dedicated pin for tachometer function. This can be considered a bug fix as it enables proper fan speed monitoring on the LM64 chip.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug by adding support for the LM64 chip, ensuring proper fan speed monitoring.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch in question is titled "net_sched: cls_bpf: remove unnecessary iteration and use passed arg." It modifies the `cls_bpf_delete` function in the `net/sched/cls_bpf.c` file.

The patch removes the unnecessary iteration through the `head->plist` list and instead directly uses the passed argument `arg` as the `cls_bpf_prog` to delete. It then deletes the program from the list, unbinds the filter, and calls the appropriate cleanup functions.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a trivial fix that removes unnecessary code and improves the efficiency of the `cls_bpf_delete` function. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of removing unnecessary code and improving code efficiency. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch adds a module license to the dwc-xlgmac driver in the Linux kernel. The lack of a license was causing a warning during module building. The patch fixes this issue by adding the "GPL" license tag to the driver.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial fix that addresses a warning related to module licensing.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/nouveau/device: type-safe register accessor macros" and it modifies the file "drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/include/nvkm/core/device.h".

2. The patch introduces type-safe register accessor macros for privileged register interface operations.

3. The new macros are defined as follows:
   - `nvkm_rd08(d,a)`: Reads an 8-bit value from the specified address in the device's memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) space.
   - `nvkm_rd16(d,a)`: Reads a 16-bit value from the specified address in the device's MMIO space.
   - `nvkm_rd32(d,a)`: Reads a 32-bit value from the specified address in the device's MMIO space.
   - `nvkm_wr08(d,a,v)`: Writes an 8-bit value to the specified address in the device's MMIO space.
   - `nvkm_wr16(d,a,v)`: Writes a 16-bit value to the specified address in the device's MMIO space.
   - `nvkm_wr32(d,a,v)`: Writes a 32-bit value to the specified address in the device's MMIO space.
   - `nvkm_mask(d,a,m,v)`: Reads a 32-bit value from the specified address, applies a mask to it, updates the value with a new mask, and writes it back to the address.

4. The patch also includes a function `nv_device(void *obj)` which returns a pointer to the `nvkm_device` structure.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch introduces necessary type-safe register accessor macros for privileged register interface operations in the `nvkm_device` structure.

Considering that this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would classify it as a non-critical enhancement. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for legacy initialization of the wl12xx wireless module on VAR-STK/DVK-OM44 boards in the OMAP2+ ARM architecture. 

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be adding support for specific hardware configurations, which does not fall under the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and arguments in the function `ced_get_out_buf_space()`. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two bugs in the __lpc_handle_xmit() function of the lpc_eth driver. Let's analyze each bug fix to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a Linux -stable release:

1) Bug fix: It can leak skbs in case TXSTATUS_ERROR is set.
   - This bug fix addresses a potential memory leak issue when the TXSTATUS_ERROR flag is set. Memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and instability in the system, which qualifies as a critical bug.
   - The fix itself involves freeing the skb (socket buffer) using dev_kfree_skb_irq() to release the allocated memory.

2) Bug fix: It can wake up txqueue while no slot was freed.
   - This bug fix addresses a potential issue where the txqueue is woken up even when no slot was freed. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential data corruption.
   - The fix checks the number of used transmit buffers and only wakes up the txqueue if the number is below a certain threshold (ENET_TX_DESC/2).

Based on the analysis, both bug fixes address real and critical issues that can cause data corruption, resource leaks, and instability. The fixes do not appear to be trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace corrections.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to accidentally enabling the RTC channel during resume. This issue can cause problems with timers and interrupts, leading to timeouts and potential data corruption. 

The patch adds a check to only enable the HPET RTC timer if the device may wake up. This ensures that the timer initialization is only performed when necessary. Additionally, the patch removes the call to `hpet_rtc_timer_init()` from the loop, preventing it from being called multiple times.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and resolves an issue that can cause timeouts for utilities like hwclock.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes two issues in the net/mlx4_core module related to the update-qp command.
2. The first issue is that the bit mask for currently supported driver features (MLX4_UPDATE_QP_SUPPORTED_ATTRS) was defined twice, using both an enum value and a pre-processor define directive. This is incorrect and needs to be fixed.
3. The second issue is that the return value of the mlx4_update_qp() function call from within the SRIOV resource-tracker was wrongly voided down. This means that the return value was not properly handled, which could lead to potential issues.
4. The patch fixes both of these issues by correcting the bit mask definition and properly handling the return value of mlx4_update_qp().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses real and critical bugs that could potentially cause issues in the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. The patch adds missing configuration for MBUS windows access protection in the mvneta_conf_mbus_windows function. This configuration was present but unused since the initial support in v3.8, causing the register contents to be inherited from the bootloader.

The patch includes the necessary changes to enable the access protection by writing to the MVNETA_ACCESS_PROTECT_ENABLE register. This fix addresses a potential security issue by ensuring that the register contents are properly configured instead of relying on inherited values.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to security, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the handling of prsctp policies in the sctp module. The patch changes the check for prsctp enablement from using `asoc->prsctp_enable` to `asoc->peer.prsctp_capable`. This change ensures that prsctp is enabled on both the local and peer hosts before using prsctp policies.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a non-critical bug fix that improves the handling of prsctp policies.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing break statement in the set control handler of the tvp5150 driver. It fixes a bug where the hue control would enable or disable the decode completely. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The Tilera boot infrastructure now provides the initramfs to Linux with a different name, "initramfs", instead of "initramfs.cpio.gz". This change allows for the use of other compression techniques without causing confusion.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: It adapts to the new initramfs name and also falls back to checking for the old name, ensuring compatibility with older kernels.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and is also Cc'd to the stable mailing list, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the async_probe generic module parameter. The bug causes a crash whenever the async_probe parameter is used, due to a missing required argument in the parse_args() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the bug causes a crash when using the async_probe parameter, which can be considered a critical issue.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the bug causes a crash, which can be classified as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch addresses a specific bug and does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a critical bug that causes a crash and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference in the bcm2835_i2c_isr() function. This bug was introduced in the commit e2474541032d, which fixed a hang issue for writing messages larger than 16 bytes.

The patch adds a check for a NULL curr_msg pointer before accessing its flags. If the curr_msg pointer is NULL, it logs an error message indicating an unexpected interrupt. Otherwise, it proceeds with the existing logic.

Given that this patch addresses a potential crash scenario and improves error handling, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an issue with the srcline translation for call chains of user space applications in the perf report command. The patch changes the assignment of the "ip" field in the "entry" function of the unwind-libdw.c and unwind-libunwind-local.c files to use the "addr" field from the "addr_location" structure instead of the "ip" value directly.

This change ensures that the correct address is used for the call chain entries, resulting in improved accuracy in the reported source lines.

Considering the nature of the patch, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses an issue related to the accuracy of the reported source lines in the perf report command.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses an issue in the perf probe functionality related to finding symbols in the kernel map. Currently, for kprobes, the patch relies on map__load() to find symbols, which can cause kprobes to fail to find symbols even if they exist in the map. To fix this, the patch suggests using map__find_symbol_by_name() instead.

The patch also introduces a new function, find_probe_functions(), which uses map__find_symbol_by_name() to search for symbols in the map. It iterates through the symbols and checks their bindings to determine if they match the desired function name.

In the main function, find_probe_trace_events_from_map(), the patch replaces the previous method of loading symbols using map__load() with the new find_probe_functions() function. It also replaces the iteration through symbols using map__for_each_symbol() with a while loop that uses symbol__next_by_name() to iterate through symbols with the same name.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue in the perf probe functionality and provides a more efficient and accurate method for finding symbols in the kernel map. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug that could impact the functionality of kprobes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to a race condition when setting the 'action' to 'idle' in the md (multiple devices) subsystem of the Linux kernel.

2. The patch provides an explanation of the problem, stating that checking the 'sync_thread' without holding the 'mddev_lock()' is not safe, even after flushing the workqueue.

3. The patch describes the race condition scenario where md_check_recovery could reap the thread itself and start another thread, leading to confusion.

4. The proposed solution is to avoid the race condition by performing the flush, test, and reap operations under the 'mddev_lock' to synchronize with md_check_recovery.

5. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

6. The patch also includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which helps track the patch's relevance.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to a race condition that can lead to confusion and incorrect behavior. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and proposes a solution that synchronizes the necessary operations under the 'mddev_lock'.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to fix the debugfs entry creation path in the f2fs filesystem.

2. The patch moves the initialization of the "status" debugfs entry to the init part of f2fs and the destruction to the exit part. This change ensures that the entry creation code will not be executed for individual partition mounts.

3. The patch includes changes to the following files:
   - fs/f2fs/debug.c
   - fs/f2fs/f2fs.h
   - fs/f2fs/super.c

4. In fs/f2fs/debug.c, the function `init_stats` is renamed to `f2fs_build_stats`. The function initializes the statistics related to the f2fs filesystem.

5. The function `f2fs_build_stats` is modified to create the "status" debugfs entry if `debugfs_root` is not already created.

6. The function `f2fs_destroy_stats` is modified to destroy the statistics related to the f2fs filesystem.

7. The function `destroy_root_stats` is renamed to `f2fs_create_root_stats` and modified to create the debugfs root directory "f2fs" and the "status" debugfs entry.

8. The function `f2fs_destroy_root_stats` is modified to remove the debugfs root directory and set `debugfs_root` to NULL.

9. In fs/f2fs/f2fs.h, the function declarations for `destroy_root_stats` are replaced with `f2fs_create_root_stats` and `f2fs_destroy_root_stats`.

10. In fs/f2fs/super.c, the `init_f2fs_fs` function is modified to call `f2fs_create_root_stats` instead of `destroy_root_stats` and `exit_f2fs_fs` is modified to call `f2fs_destroy_root_stats` instead of `destroy_root_stats`.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a valid fix for the debugfs entry creation path in the f2fs filesystem. It does not seem to introduce any trivial changes and addresses a potential issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The call to topology_init is currently placed too late, resulting in the initial scheduling domain structure being established with the default topology array. This can lead to incorrect scheduling behavior.

2. The patch fixes a critical issue: By using the smp_cpus_done() call, the s390 specific topology array can be registered early enough, ensuring that the correct topology is used for scheduling.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-critical modifications.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues: It adds an early_initcall to ensure that set_sched_topology is called at the appropriate time, without affecting other functionality.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the TX queue stop/wake flow in the mlx4_en driver. It removes the "blocked" flag, which is deemed redundant and can lead to a race condition. The race condition occurs when the TX queue is closed, and the "blocked" flag is set. In this scenario, the completion function may check the "blocked" flag, find it to be 0, and fail to open the TX queue.

To fix this race condition, the patch suggests using the netif_tx_queue_stopped function to check the state of the queue instead of relying on the "blocked" flag. If the queue is stopped and at least one packet was completed, the TX queue is woken up using netif_tx_wake_queue.

The removal of the "blocked" flag and the introduction of the netif_tx_queue_stopped function provide a more reliable and race-free solution to the problem.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and modifies only the relevant files.

Considering the patch addresses a real issue related to the TX queue flow and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak in the error path of the function `rsi_send_auto_rate_request()` in the `rsi_91x_mgmt.c` file. The patch frees the previously allocated `skb` in case memory allocation for the `selected_rates` array fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It addresses a potential memory leak, which is not explicitly mentioned as a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HID i2c-hid driver. It fixes a problem where the driver fails to probe if GPIO support is not enabled in the kernel configuration. The issue was introduced in a previous commit that did not handle the case when GPIO support is disabled.

The patch checks the return value of the acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() function, which adds ACPI GPIO interrupts, and only fails the probe if the return value is not -ENXIO or 0. This ensures that the driver does not fail if GPIO support is not enabled.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by a user, and it is signed-off by the relevant developers.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue that can cause the driver to fail probing, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of percpu_ref_tryget() and percpu_ref_tryget_live() can result in a reference leak, leading to potential hangs and race conditions during CPU hotplug and I/O operations.

2. The bug can cause hangs and race conditions: The provided stack trace indicates that the bug can lead to hangs in blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait, which can impact I/O operations. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed.

3. The fix is well-explained: The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution. It suggests using an actual boolean internally instead of truncating the atomic long result to an int, ensuring that the tryget routines return the correct value.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: The patch has been reviewed by Jens Axboe and signed-off by Douglas Miller and Tejun Heo. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has been tested.

5. The patch includes relevant metadata: The patch includes a link to the bug report, which provides additional context and information about the issue. It also includes the necessary Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org tag, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug, provides a clear and tested solution, and includes the necessary metadata. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential security issue by preventing the leakage of kernel stack memory to userland. The patch sets the `msg_namelen` member to 0 in the `hash_recvmsg` and `skcipher_recvmsg` functions, which prevents the `sockaddr_storage` variable from being leaked.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

7. Code changes:
   - Line 1288: The patch modifies the size of the "reserved_4" array from 28 to 24.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is a valid fix for a specific issue related to the qla2xxx driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the size of an array. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to the nvme/pci controller. The bug causes an 'nvme reset /dev/nvme0' command to block forever because the queues were never frozen. The patch addresses this issue by accounting for the controller state when deciding whether to freeze the queues.

Considering that the bug can potentially lead to a hang and the patch fixes the issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses an issue related to storing the status of registers in the s390/kvm code. It mentions that the current implementation may save stale versions of the ACRS/FPRS registers because the SIE state descriptor does not have fields for these guest registers. Instead, they are stored in the host registers, and the host program must copy them if needed during vcpu_put/load operations.

The patch proposes collecting the ACRS/FPRS registers before saving them to ensure that the saved values are up-to-date. This fix also resolves some strange problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw, as the low-level machine check handler revalidates all registers with the content of the save area.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to register state saving and ensures that the saved values are correct. Additionally, it resolves problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on critical bug fixes and potential data corruption issues.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a critical bug that can cause a segmentation fault when using the perf probe command with a glob. The bug occurs when perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob, leading to a segfault. 

The patch ensures that the tf->ntevs and tf->tevs variables are not modified if add_probe_trace_event() fails. It also adds error handling code to free allocated memory and clear the probe_trace_event structure in case of failure.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for s_dirty under cp_mutex in the `write_checkpoint` function in `fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c`. This change ensures that s_dirty is checked and reset under the correct mutex, which is necessary for proper synchronization.

2. The previous condition for skipping the checkpoint was incorrect. The patch fixes this by adding a check for `!sbi->s_dirty` and jumping to the `out` label if it is true. This change ensures that the checkpoint is only skipped when necessary.

3. The `block_operations` function is called after the s_dirty check, indicating that some block operations need to be performed before the checkpoint.

4. The `do_checkpoint` function is called after the block operations, indicating that the actual checkpointing process is performed.

5. The `unblock_operations` function is called after the checkpoint, indicating that any blocked operations are unblocked.

6. The `stat_inc_cp_count` function is called to increment the checkpoint count in the statistics.

7. The `mutex_unlock` function is called to release the cp_mutex.

8. The `write_checkpoint` function is traced to indicate the start and finish of the block operations and checkpoint.

9. In `fs/f2fs/super.c`, the `f2fs_sync_fs` function is modified. The previous condition for skipping the sync was incorrect and has been removed. This change ensures that the sync is performed when necessary.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a synchronization issue related to checkpointing in the f2fs filesystem. It ensures that s_dirty is checked and reset under the correct mutex and fixes the condition for skipping the checkpoint. The changes seem to address a real and critical bug, and there are no trivial fixes in the patch.

   The patch modifies the existing code in the of_free_opp_table() function.

3. Purpose of the Patch:
   The patch aims to prevent a warning message from being displayed when OPP (Operating Performance Points) are not defined for a device. It also handles the case where an invalid device is passed to the function.

4. Analysis:
   The patch checks if the device OPP is an error pointer using the IS_ERR() macro. If it is an error pointer, it further checks if the error is -ENODEV. If the error is not -ENODEV, it displays a warning message using the WARN() macro. The warning message indicates either an invalid device or the name of the device and the error code.

5. Decision:
   Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a warning message related to device OPPs. While it does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by preventing unnecessary warning messages. However, it does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

   Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves the code quality and user experience by avoiding unnecessary warning messages.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is aimed at fixing a regression introduced by commit 027bd7e89906 in the xenbus_dev_request_and_reply() function. The regression causes failed XS_TRANSACTION_START messages to leave the transaction open, which can lead to problems with suspend and migration.

The patch itself removes a section of code that was added accidentally and is not necessary for fixing the regression. Specifically, the lines that check if the return value of ret is an error and return it early have been removed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a regression that affects suspend and migration, but it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.

Therefore, my analysis is that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new software pte flag called L_PTE_NONE. This flag is set to identify faulting, present entries. The patch modifies various files in the ARM architecture to include this new flag in the page protection attributes.

From the patch description, it is mentioned that PROT_NONE mappings with the page protection attributes defined by _P000 translate to PAGE_NONE for ARM. However, on kernels without support for domains, such a page table entry (pte) with PAGE_NONE attributes is accessible to the kernel and can be read via get_user, allowing tasks to read PROT_NONE pages via syscalls such as read/write over a pipe.

The patch aims to address this issue by introducing the L_PTE_NONE flag and modifying the relevant code to handle it appropriately.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to security. It prevents tasks from reading PROT_NONE pages via syscalls, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real security issue.

2. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? 
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It is focused on adding a specific quirk for the Acer Aspire 5734Z machine.

Based on the analysis, I would conclude that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Telit LE910 V2 mobile broadband card in the cdc_ncm driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new entry for the Telit LE910 V2 device in the `cdc_devs` array, which is used for device identification. This is done by specifying the USB vendor and product IDs, USB class, CDC subclass, and protocol. This step seems reasonable as it allows the driver to recognize the Telit LE910 V2 device.

2. The `driver_info` field for the Telit LE910 V2 entry is set to `wwan_noarp_info`. This suggests that the patch is modifying the behavior of the driver for this specific device. It is important to note that the Telit LE910 V2 is mentioned to have no ARP capabilities.

3. The patch is signed-off by Daniele Palmas and reviewed by Bjørn Mork, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is adding support for a specific device and modifying the driver behavior accordingly.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to disable register synchronization for low-frequency SYSCLK in the WM8996 codec. It states that with a low-frequency SYSCLK and fast I2C clock register synchronization, there may be occasional delays causing I/O issues. Disabling synchronization is suggested to avoid such issues.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function in `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.c` and adds a new variable `sync` initialized with the value of `WM8996_REG_SYNC`. It then updates the value of `sync` to 0 when the clock rate is 32000 or 32768. Finally, it updates the `WM8996_CONTROL_INTERFACE_1` register with the value of `sync` using `snd_soc_update_bits`.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential issue with I/O caused by delays in register synchronization when using a low-frequency SYSCLK. By disabling synchronization for specific clock rates, it aims to prevent these delays and avoid I/O issues.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue related to I/O problems caused by register synchronization delays. While not critical in terms of security or stability, it can improve the overall functionality and reliability of the WM8996 codec.

5. Triviality Check:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a functional change to disable register synchronization based on clock rate.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Although it does not fix a critical bug, it addresses an issue that can impact the I/O functionality of the WM8996 codec. However, the final decision should be made by considering the opinions of the relevant maintainers and the stability requirements of the Linux -stable branch.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a bug in the paging_init() function that causes issues with unsupported highmem due to dcache aliasing. This bug can lead to coherency issues, trigger a BUG_ON, and result in invalid pointer dereference and TLB exceptions.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a specific issue related to highmem and dcache aliasing, which is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch improves detection of unsupported highmem: The patch ensures that the detection of unsupported highmem is triggered successfully by running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(). This allows the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro to evaluate correctly.

4. The patch avoids invalid pointer dereference: The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates true. This prevents the invalid pointer dereference and TLB exception that would occur when attempting to free highmem pages without valid page structs.

Based on these points, the patch addresses a critical bug, improves detection, and avoids potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to duration calculation for non-aggregated packets in the ath9k driver. The patch overrides the length in ath_tx_fill_desc before passing it to ath_buf_set_rate, which addresses the broken duration calculation.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the patch description, it does not mention any specific issues caused by the bug, such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. However, it does state that the duration calculation was broken, which suggests that it could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or performance issues.

Regarding the trivial fixes, the patch does not appear to contain any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It focuses on addressing the duration calculation issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue related to duration calculation for non-aggregated packets in the ath9k driver without any trivial modifications. However, it is important to note that further testing and verification may be necessary before including it in the stable release.

1. The patch addresses a specific bug introduced by commit 2ae66c26550cd94b0e2606a9275eb0ab7070ad0e, which caused a regression on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI.

2. The bug occurs because the driver modifies the global variable align_buffer_size when an Intel controller is found, but the Nvidia HDMI controller is probed after Intel, and Nvidia chips require aligned buffers.

3. The patch fixes the problem by moving the flag into the local struct, ensuring it is not affected by other controllers.

4. The patch includes a reference to the bug report in Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42567), indicating that the issue has been reported and tracked.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that causes a regression and provides a specific fix for the issue. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes and includes a reference to the bug report for further information.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a comparison issue in the dma debug code. The issue is that the same pointer variable 'a->dev_addr' is being compared to itself instead of comparing it to 'b->dev_addr'. This mistake is flagged by the cppcheck tool.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a simple logical error that does not have any significant impact on the system's functionality or security.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only addresses a coding style issue and does not fix a real and critical bug. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

1. The patch aims to clean up the init error handling in the ehv_bytechan driver for tty devices.

2. The patch addresses the issue of deregistering a never-registered tty driver, which could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference if driver registration fails.

3. The patch introduces changes to the error handling code in the ehv_bc_init() function.

4. In the event that the allocation of the tty driver fails, the patch updates the error handling to jump to the "err_free_bcs" label instead of the previous "error" label.

5. If the tty driver registration fails, the patch updates the error handling to jump to the "err_put_tty_driver" label instead of the previous "error" label.

6. If the platform driver registration fails, the patch updates the error handling to jump to the "err_deregister_tty_driver" label instead of the previous "error" label.

7. The patch adds the "err_deregister_tty_driver" and "err_put_tty_driver" labels to properly handle the error cases and clean up resources.

8. Finally, the patch frees the "bcs" variable and returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a clean-up and improvement of the error handling in the ehv_bytechan driver. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address any critical issues.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, which exclude "trivial" fixes, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. It only changes the GFP flags used in the netlbl_secattr_catmap_setbit() function from GFP_ATOMIC to the flags passed by the caller.

It skips the suspend and resume operations for APUs, which suggests that these operations are not necessary for APUs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous change that enabled new link protections by default in the Linux VFS. The reason for reverting the change is that it has been found to break some applications and is considered unacceptable to break existing systems.

The patch provides instructions for re-enabling the link protections if desired, but it suggests that distributions can handle this at initrd time or in system scripts. It also mentions the possibility of introducing a kernel config option to automatically set these behavioral options.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be more of a revert to address compatibility concerns.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a possible race condition in the mlx5_core_destroy_mkey() function in the mlx5_core driver.

2. The patch ensures that the mr (memory region) is first removed from the radix tree before destroying it. This prevents a race condition if the key was reallocated and an attempt was made to insert it into the radix tree.

3. The patch also handles radix tree insert/delete failures by checking the return value of radix_tree_insert() and taking appropriate action if an error occurs.

4. The patch includes proper error handling and logging in case of failures during radix tree insert/delete operations.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential race condition and improves the reliability and stability of the mlx5_core driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the md (multiple devices) subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to refine the behavior of md_check_recovery to avoid unnecessary work and reduce the frequency of info messages from ->add_disk.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

From the patch description, it seems that the issue being addressed is related to unnecessary work and excessive reporting of info messages. While this may not directly cause any of the mentioned critical issues, it can still be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not introduce any trivial fixes, it is reasonable to conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a locking bug in the SELinux/NetLabel glue code that affects systems with NetLabel enabled. The bug is causing a suspicious RCU usage error, as indicated by the kernel error message.

2. The patch corrects the locking issue by converting the bottom half socket lock to a more conventional and correct lock_sock() call.

3. The patch includes changes to the selinux_netlbl_socket_connect() function, where the bh_lock_sock_nested() call is replaced with lock_sock() and bh_unlock_sock() is replaced with release_sock().

4. The patch also removes the local_bh_disable() and local_bh_enable() calls, which were previously used to disable and enable bottom halves.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a suspicious RCU usage error. The changes made in the patch seem appropriate and necessary to fix the locking issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "Fix memory leak in query device"
   This indicates that the patch addresses a memory leak issue in the query device functionality.

2. Fixes tag: Fixes: 0837e86a7a34 ('IB/mlx5: Add per port counters')
   The patch is associated with a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the bug and verifying the fix.

3. Signed-off-by tags:
   - Majd Dibbiny <majd@mellanox.com>
   - Maor Gottlieb <maorg@mellanox.com>
   - Reviewed-by: Mark Bloch <markb@mellanox.com>
   - Signed-off-by: Leon Romanovsky <leon@kernel.org>
   - Signed-off-by: Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com>

   These tags indicate the authors and reviewers of the patch, providing a level of accountability and validation.

4. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the mlx5_ib_add() function in the main.c file of the mlx5 driver.

   - Line 3115: If the initialization of node data fails, the patch jumps to the "err_free_port" label instead of "err_dealloc".
   - Line 3125: If the link layer is Ethernet, the patch jumps to the "err_free_port" label instead of "err_dealloc" if enabling RoCE fails.

   Both jumps lead to the same error handling code, which frees the "dev->port" resource.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a memory leak issue in the query device functionality. The code changes correctly handle the error cases by freeing the "dev->port" resource. The patch also includes appropriate tags and references to track the bug and validate the fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the number of offload queue sets in the cxgb4 driver. The patch limits the number of offload queue sets to prevent a driver crash on machines with more cores than the maximum allowed offload queue sets.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a potential hang or crash issue, which qualifies as a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch tablet (056a:00d0) in the HID: wacom driver. The issue is that the device is being removed before the mode setting can be executed due to the introduction of delayed work for querying the mode on all tablets.

The patch cancels the delayed work and calls the _wacom_query_tablet_data() function to set the mode on the ghost pen interface before removing the device. This ensures that the mode setting is executed before the device is removed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch tablet.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing spinlock initialization in the aq_ring structure in the Aquantia Ethernet driver. The patch adds the necessary spin_lock_init() function call to initialize the lock.

Since this patch addresses a missing initialization, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a missing initialization and does not address any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific bug related to GPU hangs in the Intel i915 driver. The patch disables the RHWO (Render Hang Workaround Optimization) optimization by setting specific bits in the GEN7_COMMON_SLICE_CHICKEN1 register.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses GPU hangs, which can be considered a critical issue.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a security issue? No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any trivial fixes? No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. Does it meet the "oh, that's not good" criteria? Yes, GPU hangs can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical bug and does not introduce any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a slab-out-of-bounds error, which is a memory corruption issue. This can lead to system instability, crashes, or potential security vulnerabilities.

2. The bug is reproducible on a specific hardware platform: The issue has been observed on the Rockchip platform rk3368 SoC, which supports USB 2.0. This indicates that the bug is not limited to a specific edge case and can affect a significant number of users.

3. The bug is triggered by specific kernel configurations: The bug is reported when the kernel is built with CONFIG_KASAN=y (Kernel Address Sanitizer) and CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y (SLUB allocator debugging). These configurations are commonly used for debugging and testing purposes, indicating that the bug can impact developers and testers.

4. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch avoids accessing the Companion descriptor if the gadget is not SuperSpeed. This ensures that the out-of-bounds access is prevented, addressing the root cause of the bug.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch focuses on fixing the critical bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and improve the stability and security of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the get_fmt callback function in the m5mols driver. The patch corrects an inverted check of the return value from __find_format().

Since this patch only addresses a typo and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. This BUG_ON statement was causing a regression in the Linux kernel version 3.5, resulting in a kernel crash.

The regression was introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16, which removed the list of pinned inactive objects in the i915 driver.

According to Chris Wilson, the author of the commit, the BUG_ON statement is unnecessary and the checks it performs are too late to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state. Therefore, removing the BUG_ON statement is the correct action to take.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression that causes a kernel crash and removes unnecessary code.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the Xen pciback driver and the resetting of pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called. The patch aims to avoid resetting pci_dev->irq in the 3.19 kernel version as a hotfix, with a proper fix planned for the next merging window.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug being fixed is specific to the Xen pciback driver and does not directly cause any of the mentioned critical issues. Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to indexing beyond the end of the failed_num[] and fdev[] arrays in the need_this_block() function in the md/raid5 driver. The patch limits the loops to a maximum of 2 iterations to prevent indexing beyond the end of the arrays.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to assess the severity and impact of the issue.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and analysis to determine the severity and impact of the bug being fixed by this patch. If it is confirmed to be a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier, and the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, then it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if the bug is not critical or the patch contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The patch description states that on non-DeviceTree platforms, the index of the serial device is incremented even if a deferred probe happens. This can lead to memory corruption as the index may point outside of the statically allocated array.

2. The bug can cause memory corruption: The out-of-bounds access can lead to memory corruption, which is a critical issue.

3. The patch fixes the bug: The patch modifies the code to increment the index only on a successful probe, ensuring that it stays within the bounds of the array.

4. The patch has a reported-by tag: The bug was reported by Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz, indicating that it has been identified and confirmed by a reliable source.

5. The patch has a Fixes tag: The patch references a specific commit that introduced the bug, indicating that it is a targeted fix for a known issue.

6. The patch has proper sign-offs: The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a recursive locking bug introduced in the imx_console_write() function, which can cause issues such as being stuck on the lock and being unable to determine the cause of a kernel crash.

2. The patch proposes a solution to avoid locking in the sysrq case and use trylock in the oops_in_progress case, which is a common approach used in other drivers as well.

3. The patch also identifies another issue related to the port->sysrq indicator, which can lead to console writes happening unlocked. The proposed solution involves introducing a separate indicator port->sysrq_cpu and modifying the locking check accordingly.

4. The patch includes a reported-and-tested-by tag and is signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Considering the critical nature of the bug being fixed and the proposed solution, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and reliability of the kernel.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation introduces a race condition where accessing already freed memory can occur when the timer expires again.

2. The bug can potentially cause data corruption or other issues: Accessing freed memory can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes or data corruption.

3. The patch provides a fix for the bug: It suggests replacing the use of mod_timer with mod_timer_pending to prevent the race condition.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a significant issue rather than making trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the identified bug and prevent potential issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a resource management issue during the resume step of the stmmac driver. The patch aims to address a memory leak by reinitializing descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume, instead of freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for enabling the passing of probe requests and beacons from foreign APs in AP mode and GO mode. This is necessary for setting the ht protection IE properly. The patch also includes the same filters for GO mode, which were likely missing by mistake.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm in the TCP implementation. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

The patch modifies the code in the tcp_process_loss function in the tcp_input.c file. It changes the condition for resetting the F-RTO flag (tp->frto) to only reset it if the loss was real (step 3.a). This change ensures that F-RTO probes are not over-sent when the next ACK advances SND_UNA and does not sack new packets.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause longer HoL blocking on the receiver side, improving the overall stability and performance of the TCP implementation.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that prevented waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates. The patch suggests that there are better ways to fix this issue.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch description does not provide enough information to determine if it meets these criteria. It does not mention any specific bug or issue that is being addressed. Without more context, it is difficult to make an informed decision.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further analysis and information would be required to make a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting the commit is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Given that the patch is reverting a previous implementation and the reason provided for the revert is a race condition, it suggests that the previous implementation was causing issues. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior and can potentially cause hangs, data corruption, or other critical issues.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang or data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open.

2. The patch addresses a specific scenario where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

3. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

4. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to take the synack_stamp as a parameter instead of using tp->lsndtime.

5. If synack_stamp is available and there are no total retransmissions, the patch calculates the sequence RTT as tcp_time_stamp - synack_stamp.

6. If tp->srtt is not set (indicating that the ACK acks both the SYNACK and the Fast Open'd data packets sent in SYN_RECV), the patch calls tcp_ack_update_rtt() to update the RTT.

7. The patch also introduces a new variable synack_stamp in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function to store the SYNACK timestamp.

8. Depending on whether a request_sock is present or not, the patch assigns the appropriate value to synack_stamp.

9. The patch then sets tp->total_retrans to req->num_retrans and removes the request_sock if it exists.

10. If no request_sock is present, the patch assigns tp->lsndtime to synack_stamp.

11. The patch initializes various TCP parameters and calls tcp_synack_rtt_meas() with the appropriate synack_stamp value.

12. Finally, the patch adjusts tp->advmss if tp->rx_opt.tstamp_ok is true.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific scenario related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open. It addresses a potential issue and improves the accuracy of RTT measurement. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a reject for the MPC5121 platform if an input-only pin is requested to be output. This is done to comply with the reference manual (18.3.1.1). This indicates that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. Therefore, this is a positive aspect.

2. The patch also includes a rewrite of the mach-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which is expected to scale better. This is an improvement in terms of code efficiency and maintainability, but it does not directly address any critical bug or issue. Therefore, this part of the patch can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a mixed case. It addresses a real and critical bug related to input-only pins being set as output, but it also includes a "trivial" fix for code efficiency. Considering the critical bug fix, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it would be advisable to separate the critical bug fix from the "trivial" fix to maintain the focus on addressing critical issues in the stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm (memory management) in the Nouveau DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a particular resource, and it avoids the need to add checks for the mm's existence throughout the code.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they modify the logic of the `nouveau_mm_init` function in the `mm.c` file. It introduces conditional statements to handle the case when the length is zero.

3. The patch does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption: The changes made in the patch do not appear to introduce any new issues that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

4. The patch does not address a real security issue: The patch does not mention or address any security-related concerns or vulnerabilities.

5. The patch does not fix any "oh, that's not good" issue: The patch does not mention or address any critical issues that could cause significant problems or impact system stability.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and non-trivial fix for a specific issue in the Nouveau DRM driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch description states that a deadlock can occur when using NVMe-oF with a small queue size (<32), leading to an error message and a failed send operation.

2. The patch provides a fix for the issue: The patch changes the way signaling is done, depending on the queue depth, instead of relying on a magic define. It introduces a new function, `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit()`, which calculates the signaling limit based on the queue size. This change ensures that completions are sent appropriately and prevents the deadlock.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch focuses on addressing the deadlock issue and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged: It has been reviewed and acknowledged by Sagi Grimberg, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. However, it is always recommended to further review and test the patch in the specific environment to ensure its effectiveness and compatibility.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the intended behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It modifies the scheduling behavior of the task, which can have a significant impact on the system's behavior.

3. The patch does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a straightforward code improvement that enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver in the musb subsystem. The issue was caused by a lack of validation of the corresponding ->driver_data pointer when the musb core driver fails to probe or hasn't been probed yet.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: Yes, the NULL pointer dereference during system suspend can lead to system instability or crashes.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, a NULL pointer dereference can potentially lead to system instability or crashes, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It specifically addresses the NULL pointer dereference issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to system instability or crashes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not getting out of idle when HDMI is enabled. The patch introduces a temporary hack by adding a call to `dss_runtime_get()` before calling `pm_runtime_get_sync()` for the HDMI platform device. It also adds a corresponding call to `dss_runtime_put()` in `hdmi_runtime_put()`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, it addresses an issue where the DSS clock domain fails to transition from idle to active state, causing HDMI not to work correctly.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the functionality of HDMI.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch introduces a specific workaround to address the issue.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the patch is described as a temporary hack, and the author suggests that a correct fix should be implemented later. Therefore, it would be advisable to monitor the situation and consider a more permanent solution in the future.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a build error in the s3c2410_udc driver. The error is caused by passing the address of a bit-field 'maxpacket' instead of its value to the 'usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit' function.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves correcting a compilation error rather than addressing a substantial problem.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that causes a crash with a general protection fault. The crash is caused by a use-after-free issue in the blk_exit_rl() function. The patch addresses this issue by making blk_init_rl() take a reference on struct request_queue and modifying the blk_exit_rl() function to properly handle the reference.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to crashes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt enable code in the cavium-octeon MMC driver. The patch description explains that on some OCTEON SoCs with CIU3, there is no interrupt masking local to the MMC bus interface, and attempting to store to the enable register can cause interrupts to fire immediately, breaking the driver.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `octeon_mmc_int_enable` function to only write to the enable register if the `host` does not have CIU3. This change ensures that the register is not touched on SoCs where it could cause problems.

Considering the patch description and the fix it provides, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as oops or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to resolve the hang of direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN.
2. It mentions that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag should be set simultaneously with the increase of i_aiodio_unwritten since ext4_end_io_nolock clears the flag and decreases the counter at the same time.
3. It acknowledges that not increasing i_aiodio_unwritten when setting EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN can cause it to go negative and cause some processes to wait indefinitely.
4. The patch includes a reference to a previous email thread where the problem was reported and tested by Michael Tokarev.
5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Sandeen, Tao Ma, and Theodore Ts'o.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug and addresses an issue that can impact system stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the virtio console driver. When a port is unplugged while a user is blocked on a read operation, the current behavior is to return -ENODEV. However, subsequent read operations return 0, indicating no host-side connection but not indicating that the device went away. This can lead to confusion for users who are not monitoring the SIGIO signal.

The patch fixes this issue by ensuring that all read operations return -ENODEV after the port gets unplugged. This aligns the behavior of read() with write(), which already returns -ENODEV in such cases.

The patch is concise and focused, addressing the specific issue without introducing any trivial fixes. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and a CC to the stable mailing list, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the appropriate fix provided by the patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to GPU reset in the Intel i915 driver. The bug causes interference with GPU initialization and may trigger a warning. The patch aims to solve this issue by disabling RPS interrupts and flushing related work items before resetting the GPU.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It addresses a critical bug that can potentially cause system instability and data corruption. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the analysis suggests that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the initialization of nlmsvc_timeout in the lockd daemon. The race condition occurs when nlmclnt_init() starts the lockd daemon and then calls nlm_bind_host() with the expectation that nlmsvc_timeout has already been initialized. However, there is no synchronization between lockd() and lockd_up() to guarantee this.

The fix moves the initialization of nlmsvc_timeout into lockd_create_svc, ensuring that it is properly initialized before being used. This resolves the race condition and prevents potential issues caused by accessing uninitialized data.

Considering the patch fixes a race condition that could lead to unexpected behavior or issues, it addresses a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel oops issue in the MIPS architecture. The patch checks for unsupported reloc types in modules and returns an error code if no handler is found. This prevents the kernel from blindly branching to a NULL value or dereferencing an invalid memory location.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential kernel oops and improves the stability of the system, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the udc core of the USB gadget driver. The patch ensures that the udc device is properly deleted if an error occurs during the registration process.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as build errors or data corruption. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the Xen balloon driver. The bug occurs when highmem pages are requested from the balloon on a system without highmem. In such cases, the alloc_xenballooned_pages function will allocate all available memory in an attempt to find highmem pages to return. This can lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) situation.

The patch modifies the alloc_xenballooned_pages function to allow low memory to be returned when highmem pages are requested. This change prevents the function from entering an infinite loop and avoids the OOM condition.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It directly addresses the bug and improves the functionality of the Xen balloon driver.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of the bug and the non-trivial nature of the patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to preventing inner-reload while virtual functions (VFs) exist in the bnx2x driver. The bug was introduced in a previous patch and caused the MTU change to not be prevented correctly. The patch moves the check to the correct spot in the code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a relatively minor issue related to MTU change prevention when VFs are enabled.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "PCI: imx6: Fix config read timeout handling" and it references a specific commit that made PCI configuration requests non-posted.

2. The patch explains that synchronous aborts need to be handled differently from the asynchronous aborts that were previously received. Specifically, the PC (program counter) needs to be advanced when resolving the abort.

3. The patch includes code changes in the `imx6q_pcie_abort_handler` function to handle the synchronous aborts. It checks the instruction being executed and modifies the register values accordingly.

4. The patch also includes changes in the `imx6_pcie_init` function to install the abort handler.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to handling synchronous aborts during PCI configuration requests on the imx6 platform. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to nested virtualization with VPID (Virtual Processor Identifier) in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. The bug causes an unhandled exception and a crash when running the kvm-unit-tests/vmx.flat test suite on L0 (Level 0) with VPID disabled.

The patch aims to address this issue by preventing the nested VPID enable bit from being set unconditionally during the setup of nested vmx exec controls if VPID is disabled on L0. Instead, the nested VPID enable bit is only set if VPID is enabled on L0.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It addresses a real and critical issue that can lead to crashes and unhandled exceptions. Additionally, the fix does not appear to be trivial, as it involves modifying the conditional setting of the nested VPID enable bit.

Therefore, my analysis suggests that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the thunder-pem driver in the PCI subsystem. The issue is that reserving the full 16M range for PEM-specific resources causes a failure when the pcieport driver requests resources. This failure prevents proper initialization of the thunder-pem driver.

The patch fixes this issue by modifying the resource reservation. Instead of reserving the full 16M range, the patch reserves only the PEM-specific register, which has a size of SZ_64K. This change ensures that the child device driver does not fail when requesting resources.

Additionally, the patch increases the PEM resource size back to SZ_16M at the end, as this is what the thunder_pem_init() call expects for proper initialization.

The patch also includes a fix for reserving the PCI configuration space.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause device driver failures and prevents proper initialization of the thunder-pem driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is focused on resolving the specific issue at hand. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a deadlock issue between the "chcp" and "thaw" ioctls in the nilfs2 file system. The deadlock occurs when the "thaw" ioctl is called while the "chcp" command is waiting at nilfs_transaction_begin(). The patch replaces the usage of sb->s_umount with a dedicated mutex to protect snapshot mounts, thus resolving the deadlock issue.

Considering that the deadlock is 100% reproducible and the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause system hangs, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning message related to the absence of a "/cpus" node in certain DT platforms. The patch simply removes the warning message and returns NULL if the "/cpus" node is not found.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is adding a new USB ID for the ath9k_htc module to recognize a Philips (or NXP) PTA01 wireless adapter. The patch has been tested on real hardware and the USB ID is correctly recognized by lsusb.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it adds support for a specific USB device.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address any critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch removes the BUG_ON() statements in the btrfs_map_block function. BUG_ON() statements are typically used to catch unexpected conditions and trigger a kernel panic. Removing these statements means that the code will no longer panic when certain conditions are met.

2. The patch replaces the BUG_ON() statements with error handling code that logs an error message and returns -EINVAL. This change suggests that the patch is attempting to handle potential errors gracefully instead of triggering a panic.

3. The error handling code added in the patch includes logging the error message and freeing the extent map before returning -EINVAL. This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up in case of an error.

4. The error messages added in the patch provide additional information about the specific error conditions encountered, such as stripe math going wrong or stripe index math going wrong.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing potential error conditions in a more graceful manner by providing error messages and returning an appropriate error code. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential infinite loop issue in the qla4xxx driver. The patch explicitly increases the next_idx variable in the error condition, which ensures that the loop will eventually terminate.

Since an infinite loop can cause a hang and potentially impact system stability, this patch addresses a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference issue in the smp_conn_security() function in the Bluetooth subsystem. This is a potential crash-causing bug, which qualifies as a critical issue.

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not include any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the NULL pointer dereference issue.

3. The patch improves error handling: The patch adds a check for a NULL pointer before accessing the conn->smp pointer. If the pointer is NULL, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an appropriate error code. This improves the error handling and prevents potential crashes.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Johan Hedberg and Marcel Holtmann, who are recognized developers in the Bluetooth subsystem. This indicates that the patch has undergone a thorough review process.

Considering these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the NULL pointer dereference issue in the Bluetooth subsystem.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an incorrect check of the dma_set_mask() call in the cthw20k1.c file of the ALSA ctxfi driver. The patch corrects the bug by adding a missing "!" operator in the if statement.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a relatively low severity bug that does not have a significant impact on most machines.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a consistency issue between IPv4 and IPv6 conntrack handling of invalid packets. The patch ensures that both IPv4 and IPv6 conntrack mark invalid packets as INVALID and allow the user to drop them.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a consistency improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial clean-up in the `acct_isolated()` function of the `mm/compaction.c` file. The patch removes the `nr_anon` and `nr_file` fields from the `compact_control` structure and modifies the `acct_isolated()` function to count the number of isolated anonymous and file pages using the `count` array.

Since this patch is a trivial clean-up and does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) optimization in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a problem where the frag0 address becomes invalid if modified by pskb_may_pull or its variants, causing incorrect usage of the GRO fast path in the IPv6 extension header path.

The patch disables the fast path when entering the IPv6 extension header path and includes a fix for the reported issue. It also includes a "Fixes" tag referencing the commit that introduced the problem and a "Reported-by" tag acknowledging the person who reported the issue.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to firmware loading in the brcmfmac driver. The patch adds an error code parameter to the firmware loading failure callback and makes some modifications to the error handling logic.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue related to firmware loading failure in the brcmfmac driver.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly mention any of these issues. It seems to be more focused on improving error handling and callback behavior.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces functional changes to the code.

Based on the analysis, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. While the patch addresses a specific issue, it does not seem to meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the changes introduced by the patch do not appear to be significant enough to warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough examination of the code and its impact would be necessary for a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a kmem_cache leak in the IB/rxe driver. The patch decrements the qp reference when handling an error path in the completer, preventing the leak.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. It is not a trivial fix, as it addresses a specific issue rather than making cosmetic changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the Bluetooth RFCOMM code that could lead to an information leak. The patch correctly identifies that the padding bytes in the struct rfcomm_dev_list_req and struct rfcomm_dev_info are not initialized, potentially exposing uninitialized kernel heap memory.

The proposed solution is to allocate the required memory using kzalloc() instead of kmalloc(). kzalloc() initializes the allocated memory to zero, which ensures that the padding bytes are properly initialized.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential security issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt storm on resume for certain systems using the Cherryview platform. The issue is triggered by a BIOS bug that sets a GPIO pin to trigger on a high level, causing a flood of interrupt messages on resume.

The patch addresses this issue by moving the suspend and resume hooks to be called at _noirq time, allowing the mask to be reset to a known state before interrupt storm occurs. This prevents the possible interrupt storm and resolves the issue.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause an interrupt storm and potentially impact system stability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Additionally, the patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and has been reported by a user, which adds credibility to the fix.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a NULL-pointer dereference issue that can occur when a malicious device lacks an interrupt-in endpoint. This is a real and critical bug that can lead to potential crashes or security vulnerabilities.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the bug. This indicates that the patch is addressing a known issue.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman, which adds credibility to its correctness and importance.

4. The changes made in the patch are focused on fixing the issue and do not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch includes a comment indicating that there is a broken check for an interrupt-in endpoint, which suggests that the issue is well-understood and the fix is appropriate.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes, but rather addresses a specific bug.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the NULL-pointer dereference issue in the mos7840 USB-Serial driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to caching ACLs returned from the server.
2. The issue is described as a potential buffer overflow when the bitmap size + ACL size is greater than a PAGE_SIZE, but the ACL size itself is smaller than a PAGE_SIZE.
3. The patch modifies the `nfs4_write_cached_acl` function to use `_copy_from_pages` instead of `memcpy` to avoid reading past the buffer page boundary.
4. The patch also modifies the `__nfs4_get_acl_uncached` function to correctly pass the `pages` parameter to `nfs4_write_cached_acl` and remove the unused `resp_buf` variable.
5. Additionally, there is a minor fix in the `decode_getacl` function to correct a debug message.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential buffer overflow issue that could lead to data corruption. The changes made in the patch are necessary and relevant to fix the issue, and there are no trivial fixes included.
true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the calculation of the `limits->max_policy_pct` value in the `intel_pstate_set_policy` function of the `intel_pstate.c` file in the `cpufreq` driver.

2. The issue is described as a rounding error when calculating the `limits->max_policy_pct` value, which affects the maximum frequency that the CPU can reach.

3. The patch proposes to fix the rounding error by using the `DIV_ROUND_UP` macro to ensure that the value is rounded up instead of down.

4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` and `Acked-by` tags from relevant contributors.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a real issue that affects the correct calculation of the maximum CPU frequency, which can impact system performance. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is focused on resolving a critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to reading off the end of a packet when collecting TCP flags in the openvswitch module. The patch adds a length check to ensure that the packet is long enough to contain the TCP header before attempting to read it.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential data corruption issue and is not a trivial fix. It also does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a warning generated by some versions of GCC in the eicon driver. The warning is related to an array subscript being above array bounds in the file "eicon/platform.h". The code change proposed in the patch aims to avoid this warning by open-coding the PUT_WORD() line.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a warning that does not impact the functionality or stability of the system.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to handling -1 uid's and gid's in the svcrpc module. The bug causes failures and can lead to nfsd failing to reply to the first attempt to use a newly negotiated krb5 context.

The patch addresses the issue by fixing the oversight in handling the gid upcall, which was previously causing -EINVAL errors. It removes the check for uid validity, which was unnecessary and could potentially cause false negatives.

Considering the patch fixes a real bug that can lead to failures and has been reported and tested by a user, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "tcp: clear xmit timers in tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock()". This suggests that it aims to fix a specific issue related to clearing transmit timers in the tcp_v4_syn_recv_sock() function.

2. The patch description mentions that Simon Kirby reported divides by zero errors in __tcp_select_window(). This indicates that there is a bug causing divide by zero errors in the mentioned function.

3. It is stated that the bug occurs when inet_csk_route_child_sock() returns a NULL pointer. This implies that there is a specific condition where the function returns NULL, leading to the reported bug.

4. The patch proposes a fix by calling tcp_clear_xmit_timers() before unlocking the socket and releasing it. This suggests that clearing transmit timers is necessary to prevent the reported bug.

5. The patch includes a reference to a previous commit (918eb39962dff) and provides the necessary information for proper attribution (Reported-by, Signed-off-by, Tested-by).

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that can cause divide by zero errors and provides a specific fix to clear transmit timers. The patch also includes proper attribution and references to related commits, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes error handling in the udc_pci_probe() function of the amd5536udc USB gadget driver.
2. Previously, if a failure occurred early in udc_pci_probe(), the error handling code would only free the device structure and return.
3. The patch adds proper resource deallocations in udc_pci_probe() itself, as udc_pci_remove() is not suitable to be called so early in the initialization process.
4. Additionally, the patch replaces iounmap(dev->regs) with iounmap(dev->virt_addr) in udc_pci_remove() for clarity.
5. The patch was found by the Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).
6. The patch is signed-off by Alexey Khoroshilov <khoroshilov@ispras.ru> and Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses error handling in the udc_pci_probe() function, ensuring proper resource deallocations and improving code clarity. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in the max8997-haptic driver. The issue occurs when booting with Device Tree Blob (DTB) because the platform data for the haptic device is not set in the supplied data from the parent MFD device. This results in a kernel Oops and a NULL pointer dereference.

The patch checks if the platform data is available and assigns it to the haptic_pdata variable. If the platform data is not available, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a kernel Oops and a NULL pointer dereference, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be removing a broken attempt at GPU reset using genpd. The patch author has confirmed that it doesn't actually work and caused build breakage due to using CONFIG_PM_SLEEP functions without the proper Kconfig dependency on PM_SLEEP.

The patch itself removes the code related to the broken GPU reset attempt and replaces it with a comment explaining the need for the interface in the context of GPU reset.

Given that the patch is removing non-functional code and addressing build breakage, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

   The NULL pointer dereference issue can lead to a crash or system instability, which qualifies as a critical bug.

3. Testing:
   The patch has been tested and reported by Baozeng Ding <sploving1@gmail.com>. This indicates that the fix has been verified and confirmed to resolve the issue.

4. Sign-offs:
   The patch has been signed-off by Richard Alpe <richard.alpe@ericsson.com> and Acked-by Jon Maloy <jon.maloy@ericsson.cm>. These sign-offs indicate that the patch has been reviewed and approved by experts in the field.

5. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are minimal and focused on adding a check for the existence of the socket before parsing the attributes. This change directly addresses the NULL pointer dereference issue.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a critical bug, has been tested, and has received sign-offs from experts.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the spi-orion driver. The patch checks the return pointer of the of_match_device() function and sets the local device data to the lowest common denominator orion device data if it is NULL.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference, which is an important issue but not critical.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the iPhone 4S to the ipheth driver in the Linux kernel. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   No, this patch does not fix a bug. It adds support for a new device.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   No, this patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? 
   No, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to fix an issue with the regulator_summary function in the debugfs code.
2. The issue occurs when calling regulator_get with a NULL dev argument, which is allowed but causes an error when printing /sys/kernel/debug/regulator_summary.
3. The patch explicitly handles "deviceless" consumers in the debugfs code to fix the error.
4. It checks if the consumer's dev pointer is not NULL before printing the device name in the regulator_summary_show_subtree function.
5. If the consumer's dev pointer is NULL, it prints "deviceless" instead of the device name.
6. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and Cc tags for proper attribution and notification.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue that can cause an error in the regulator_summary function. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves handling NULL dev pointers and modifying the debugfs code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new interface called `add_device_randomness()` for adding device-specific or boot-specific data to the random pool. This data is meant to initialize the pool to different values for devices that might otherwise be identical and have very little entropy available to them, particularly in the embedded world.

The patch does not add any actual entropy to the pool but aims to avoid the problem of the nonblocking pool having similar initial states across largely identical devices.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

This indicates that the patch should be backported to older kernels that contain this commit, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

Based on this analysis, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be included.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to hash faults for kernel regions in the powerpc/spufs module. The bug was introduced in commit ac29c64089b7, which replaced _PAGE_USER with _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and denied kernel access to non-_PAGE_PRIVILEGED pages. However, this change was not reflected in the hash fault handler for spufs' kernel accesses, causing issues with DMAs required to establish SPE memory.

The patch adds _PAGE_PRIVILEGED to the hash fault handler for kernel accesses, addressing the problem. It includes the necessary Fixes tag and has been reviewed by relevant individuals.

1. The patch fixes a build error in the m68k architecture when the CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM configuration is enabled.
2. The error is caused by an implicit declaration of the function "pfn_to_nid" in the mm/ksm.c file.
3. The function "pfn_to_nid" is expected to be declared in the arch's asm/mmzone.h file for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.
4. The patch suggests that the declaration of "pfn_to_nid" is only expected when CONFIG_NUMA is enabled.
5. The patch modifies the "get_kpfn_nid" function in mm/ksm.c to use the NUMA macro around the "pfn_to_nid" function call.
6. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reported-by tags.

The patch addresses a regression issue related to rfkill on the rt2500pci device. It reverts to the old behavior on rt2500pci to fix the regression. Additionally, it also fixes another issue introduced by a previous commit by unregistering rfkill on device removal instead of ifconfig down.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. In the file `drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2500pci.c`:
   - Line 1681: Adds a check for a specific device capability flag and sets another capability flag if the condition is met.
   - Line 1126: Modifies the code to stop rfkill polling if the specific capability flag is set.
   - Line 1166: Modifies the code to start rfkill polling if the specific capability flag is set.
   - Line 1375: Modifies the code to start rfkill polling if the specific capability flag is not set.
   - Line 1390: Modifies the code to stop rfkill polling if the specific capability flag is not set.

2. In the file `drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2x00.h`:
   - Line 693: Adds a new capability flag `REQUIRE_DELAYED_RFKILL`.

3. In the file `drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2x00dev.c`:

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue is described as a warning seen with W=1 due to a change in DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST. This warning is caused by the C compiler converting divide operations with unsigned divisors to unsigned, even if the dividend is signed and negative. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: It checks for the divisor variable type when deciding which operation to perform, fixing DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(0, 2U) and similar operations. However, it still returns bad values for negative dividends divided by unsigned divisors, which is marked as unsupported.

3. The bug has a known impact: The s2c_hwmon driver reports a value of 4198403 instead of 0 if the ADC reads 0. This indicates a real issue that can affect system functionality.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reviewed and tested by Juergen Beisert, who reported the issue, and has been signed-off by multiple developers.

Based on this analysis, the patch addresses a real and critical bug, provides a fix, and has been reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix a bug in the qlcnic driver related to mailbox completion handling during a spurious interrupt. When the driver is in the middle of processing a mailbox completion and receives a spurious mailbox interrupt, it mistakenly treats it as a valid completion interrupt, leading to premature completion of the next mailbox request. The patch fixes this issue by checking the current state of mailbox processing and ignoring the spurious interrupt. Additionally, it adds a stats counter to record this condition.

2. Impact:
   This bug does not cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it can lead to incorrect completion of mailbox requests.

3. Patch Analysis:
   The patch modifies the qlcnic_83xx_handle_aen() function in qlcnic_83xx_hw.c to handle the spurious interrupt correctly. It checks if the received event is a mailbox asynchronous event and calls the appropriate function. If the event is not an asynchronous event, it checks the response status of the mailbox and either notifies the mailbox response or increments the stats counter for spurious interrupts.

   Additionally, the patch modifies the qlcnic_83xx_mailbox_worker() function in qlcnic_83xx_hw.c to set the response status of the mailbox to QLC_83XX_MBX_RESPONSE_WAIT before processing the mailbox command.

   Finally, the patch adds a new stats counter, mbx_spurious_intr, to the qlcnic_adapter_stats structure in qlcnic.h and updates the qlcnic_gstrings_stats array in qlcnic_ethtool.c to include the new counter.

4. Analysis Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses an issue that falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" but is not critical. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the devfreq_add_device() function, which is responsible for adding a devfreq device to the system.
2. The bug occurs when the devfreq device does not have a default governor. If find_devfreq_governor() returns an error, devfreq_add_device() fails to add the devfreq instance.
3. The patch handles this scenario by checking if the governor is an error using IS_ERR(governor). If it is an error, it logs an error message and returns the error code.
4. The patch then assigns the governor to the devfreq device and calls the event_handler() function of the governor to start it.
5. If the event_handler() function returns an error, it logs an error message.

Based on this analysis, the patch fixes a real bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or failure to add a devfreq device. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) on SandyBridge due to performance issues and frequent lockups. The patch checks the generation of the Intel graphics device and disables FBC if the generation is less than or equal to 6.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch addresses a real and critical issue, as it resolves performance degradation and lockups caused by enabling FBC on SandyBridge. This can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on disabling FBC on the affected hardware.

Therefore, based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to manual sequencing (de)activation in L2TPv2. The patch ensures that the correct amount of data is pushed for the L2TP header by updating the hdr_len session field whenever the L2TP header format is modified.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The PFC driver for R8A7791 was based on preliminary revisions of the user's manual, which omitted the HSCIF1 group E signals in the IPSR4 register description. This omission causes HSCIF1's probe to fail with error messages.

2. The bug can cause a build error: The error messages indicate that the HSCIF1 probe fails, which can lead to a build error.

3. The bug can cause a "oh, that's not good" issue: The error messages suggest that the HSCIF1 functionality is not working as intended, which can have adverse effects on the system's overall functionality.

4. The patch fixes the bug: The patch adds the necessary PINMUX_IPSR_MSEL() invocations for the HSCK1_E, HCTS1#_E, and HRTS1#_E signals, which were missing in the original code.

5. The patch is not a trivial fix: The patch addresses a significant issue in the PFC driver and is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to fix the critical bug and ensure proper functionality of the HSCIF1 group E signals on R8A7791.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the GIC/GICv3 interrupt controller on ARM-based systems. The patch ensures that all interrupts are deactivated and disabled at boot time to guarantee a clean state.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue related to the initialization of the GIC interrupt controller.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug causes PHY interrupts to be overwritten by 0, resulting in unpredictable behavior depending on the PHY's location on the MDIO bus. This can lead to issues such as data corruption or system instability.

2. The patch removes a memcpy operation: The memcpy operation is responsible for overwriting the PHY interrupts with 0. By removing this operation, the bug is fixed, and the PHYs are forced into polling mode 100% of the time.

3. The patch removes an unused member: The phy_irq member is no longer needed after the removal of the memcpy operation. Removing unused code improves code cleanliness and maintainability.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch addresses a critical bug and improves the stability and reliability of the system. It does not contain any trivial fixes, and the changes made are necessary to fix the issue at hand. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be addressing a potential issue related to lockups during writeback in the Btrfs file system. The patch replaces the use of `iput()` with `btrfs_add_delayed_iput()` to delay the final iputs and mitigate the risk of lockups.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue that may not occur frequently.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: "gpio-74x164: Fix buffer allocation size"
   The patch aims to fix the buffer allocation size in the gpio-74x164 driver.

2. Code change:
   The patch modifies the allocation size of the `chip->buffer` variable in the `gen_74x164_probe` function.
   Before the patch:
   ```
   chip->buffer = devm_kzalloc(&spi->dev, chip->gpio_chip.ngpio, GFP_KERNEL);
   ```
   After the patch:
   ```
   chip->buffer = devm_kzalloc(&spi->dev, chip->registers, GFP_KERNEL);
   ```

3. Analysis:
   The original code allocates memory for `chip->buffer` based on `chip->gpio_chip.ngpio`, which is calculated as `GEN_74X164_NUMBER_GPIOS * chip->registers`. However, the patch changes the allocation size to `chip->registers` directly.

   It is important to note that without the context of the `GEN_74X164_NUMBER_GPIOS` macro and the purpose of `chip->registers`, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the patch. If `chip->registers` represents the number of registers and `GEN_74X164_NUMBER_GPIOS` represents the number of GPIOs per register, then the original allocation size might be correct.

   However, assuming that the patch is correct and `chip->registers` represents the correct allocation size, the patch seems to fix an incorrect allocation size in the code.

4. Triviality:
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it is confirmed that `chip->registers` represents the correct allocation size. However, if there is any doubt about the correctness of the patch or the interpretation of `chip->registers`, further investigation and clarification are needed before accepting it.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The driver incorrectly uses a max TID count of 9 instead of the correct value of 8. This bug can lead to a kernel BUG and a system crash, as reported by Nikolay Martynov.

2. The bug fix is critical: The bug causes a kernel BUG and a system crash, which qualifies as a critical issue.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a genuine bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch improves code correctness: The patch corrects the off-by-one confusion in the code and ensures that the correct value (8) is used for the max TID count.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Johannes Berg and Wey-Yi Guy, indicating that it has undergone proper review and testing.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent system crashes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of bypass_val_on in the regulator_get_bypass_regmap function. The bug causes drivers to incorrectly report bypass being enabled when it is not. 

The patch introduces a fix by adding handling for the case where bypass_val_on is not defined in the drivers. It sets the value of val_on to bypass_mask if bypass_val_on is zero. This ensures that the enable flag is correctly determined based on the bitwise comparison of val and the appropriate bypass value.

Considering the patch addresses a real bug that can lead to incorrect reporting of bypass status, it can be categorized as a critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation change rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch simplifies the netlink message length assignment by using the precalculated size instead of subtracting and adding the netlink header length.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (simplifying code without addressing any real issue), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch modifies the `handle_adc_eoc_trigger` function to read the conversion value from the channel data register instead of the last converted data register. This change is made to avoid potential issues when touchscreen mode is enabled and a conversion is requested on another channel.

2. The patch also modifies the `at91_adc_rl_interrupt` and `at91_adc_9x5_interrupt` functions to check the status of the data ready interrupt for all active channels instead of just the first channel. This change ensures that the data ready interrupt is handled correctly for all channels.

3. The `at91_adc_read_raw` function is modified to set the `chnb` variable to the channel number being read. This variable is later used in the `handle_adc_eoc_trigger` function to read the conversion value from the correct channel data register.

Based on the analysis of the patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to touchscreen mode and ensures correct handling of data ready interrupts for all channels. However, it does not address any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the backref code in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch modifies the find_parent_nodes() function in the backref.c file.

The patch addresses a problem where the backref code was incorrectly looking at nodes instead of just leaves when populating extent item entries. This could lead to potential issues, such as data corruption or crashes, when random_memory matches disk_bytenr.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` is being removed from the code. The patch states that there is nothing to prevent another thread from dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call to `nfs4_ds_disconnect()`, which could result in a NULL pointer dereference and potentially cause an Oops.

The patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid the issue by invalidating the device ID. However, it is not clear from the provided context whether this change alone is sufficient to address the potential NULL pointer dereference.

Without further information or context, it is difficult to determine the impact and severity of the bug being fixed by this patch. Additionally, it is not clear if the bug being fixed falls into the categories of critical bugs that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. Further analysis and clarification would be needed to make a more definitive decision.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to running the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver.

2. The current behavior of calling dev_close() in the offline self-test causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes interface routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior when running the test.

3. The patch suggests calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close() to avoid touching IFF_UP altogether.

4. The patch includes changes in the ixgbe.h, ixgbe_ethtool.c, and ixgbe_main.c files.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to the offline self-test behavior in the ixgbe driver. It avoids an inconsistent behavior and potential data loss by calling ndo_stop() instead of dev_close(). Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The commit 0a6b76dd23fa introduced a bug that caused a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops. This bug can lead to system instability and crashes, making it a critical issue.

2. The bug causes a build error or an oops: The bug triggers an oops, as indicated by the stack trace provided. This confirms that the bug is causing a runtime error and needs to be fixed.

3. The patch fixes the issue: The patch modifies the code to check the "sc->memcg" variable instead of "memcg_kmem_enabled()" to ensure that only memcg-aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs. This fix addresses the root cause of the bug and prevents the NULL pointer dereference.

4. The patch is not a trivial fix: The patch modifies the code logic and introduces a significant change to fix the bug. It is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch has been tested and reviewed: The patch has been tested and reported by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki, and it has also been reviewed and acknowledged by Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh. This indicates that the patch has undergone testing and review by experts in the field.

Considering all these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and ensure system stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, the change increases the maximum number of properties from 16 to 24 in the DRM subsystem. This change addresses a specific issue where on i915 machines with many TV connectors, the maximum number of properties is reached, resulting in backtraces in the logs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it increases a limit to accommodate a specific scenario.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to revert a deprecation warning message related to SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. The reasons provided for reverting the message are as follows:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and is considered set in stone forever. Therefore, there is no need for a deprecation warning.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications would need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. This can be burdensome, especially for SCTP appliances that migrate to newer kernels slowly.

3) Some users may not have the opportunity to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users would encounter the warning and be stuck with older kernels.

Considering these reasons, it appears that the deprecation warning is causing unnecessary inconvenience and does not provide significant benefits. Therefore, reverting the message seems reasonable.

Additionally, the patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and has received Acked-by from the same person, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by an experienced individual in the field.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the release of the mcc/mbox lock in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function in the be_cmds.c file of the be2net driver. 

The patch checks if the be_cmd_copy() function returns an error and if so, it sets the status to -EBUSY and jumps to the "unlock" label to release the lock before returning. This ensures that the lock is properly released in case of an error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real bug that could potentially lead to a hang or data corruption if the lock is not released properly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an off-by-two bug in the "perf hists browser" tool. The bug causes misalignment of columns in the normal output. 

While this bug may not directly cause any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities, it does fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug and contains a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "pinctrl: baytrail: Clear DIRECT_IRQ bit". This suggests that it aims to address an issue related to the baytrail pinctrl driver.

2. The patch description states that the "DIRECT_IRQ" bit should be cleared for pads using the "io" mode. If not cleared, the IO-based interrupt request (irq) will never be detected.

3. It is mentioned that this bit can sometimes be misconfigured due to a BIOS issue.

4. The patch enforces the clearing of the "DIRECT_IRQ" bit in "io" mode and triggers a warning if it is not cleared.

5. The patch is signed-off by Loic Poulain and acked by Mika Westerberg, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

6. The patch is also signed-off by Linus Walleij, who is a well-known kernel developer.

7. The code changes in the patch involve adding a warning message and modifying the value of the "DIRECT_IRQ" bit in the "byt_irq_type" function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to the baytrail pinctrl driver, where the "DIRECT_IRQ" bit needs to be cleared for proper detection of IO-based interrupts. The patch also includes a warning to alert developers if the bit is not cleared. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals, including Linus Walleij.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the size of a variable-length array from using the "len" variable to a fixed size of 65. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of a code optimization and workaround for potential compiler issues on the POWER architecture.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling the use of shadow registers in the iwlwifi driver by default. The reason for this is that using this feature causes communication between the driver and the device to become unreliable, resulting in host command timeouts.

Given that the patch addresses a real issue that can lead to unreliable communication and host command timeouts, it can be considered a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a regression where kswapd could previously compact, but kcompactd could not. The patch modifies the loop condition in two places, changing the "<" operator to "<=".

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific behavior difference between kswapd and kcompactd.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a build error caused by commit 03fbf488cece, which removed the type LPSS_SSP without realizing it was being used in this code.

2. The build error is a real and critical bug that prevents successful compilation of the code, making it necessary to fix.

3. The patch removes the incorrect DT binding that caused the build error, effectively resolving the issue.

4. The Fixes tag in the patch indicates that it is addressing a specific commit that introduced the problem.

5. The patch has been reported by Axel Lin and signed-off by Jarkko Nikula, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

6. The patch is also marked for stable release (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), suggesting that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

7. The change made in the patch is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, but rather a necessary modification to address a build error.

Based on these points, it can be concluded that this patch fixes a real and critical bug and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression related to VLANs for the 57710 and 57711 adapters in the bnx2x driver. The regression causes a null pointer dereference when loading the 8021q module on machines with these adapters. The patch adds a check for the specific chip type (E1x) to correctly set the accept_any_vlan flag.

Considering the patch addresses a real bug that can lead to a null pointer dereference, it qualifies as a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to make dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() iterate only over IN endpoints that are actually present, based on the num_in_eps parameter. This is done to prevent dereferencing a potential NULL dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

2. The patch modifies the loop condition from "for (num = 0; num < DWC3_ENDPOINTS_NUM; num++)" to "for (num = 0; num < dwc->num_in_eps; num++)". This change ensures that the loop only iterates over the valid IN endpoints.

3. The patch also changes the way the IN endpoint is accessed within the loop. Instead of using "struct dwc3_ep *dep = dwc->eps[num];", it uses "struct dwc3_ep *dep = dwc->eps[(num << 1) | 1];". This change is made to correctly access the IN endpoint based on the direction bit.

4. The patch removes the condition "if (!(dep->number & 1)) continue;" which was used to skip non-IN endpoints. This condition is no longer needed since the loop now only iterates over IN endpoints.

5. The patch updates the FIFO size calculation and writing to the register. Instead of using "dwc3_writel(dwc->regs, DWC3_GTXFIFOSIZ(fifo_number), fifo_size);", it uses "dwc3_writel(dwc->regs, DWC3_GTXFIFOSIZ(num), fifo_size);". This change ensures that the correct FIFO size is written to the register.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to iterating over valid IN endpoints and correctly accessing the FIFO size. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the SCTP module of the Linux kernel. This bug can lead to a kernel panic and is triggered by a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet. The patch addresses the issue by checking for NULL when calling the sctp_get_af_specific() function.

Considering that the bug can result in a kernel panic and the patch directly addresses the issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause a hang or oops in the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to accessing ctl_table in the proc_sys_poll() function. The bug can occur if poll() is called in entries created by modules, such as hostname and domainname, and if the user called poll() in a file that doesn't support it. The bug can lead to a kernel crash, as reported by Dave Jones.

The patch addresses the issue by protecting the code accessing ctl_table using grab_header() and sysctl_head_finish(). It grabs the header before accessing ctl_table and releases it after. This ensures that if an entry goes away while polling, ctl_table will still exist.

Considering that the bug can cause a kernel crash and the patch provides a necessary fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to system instability and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to enable the cpuid for Intel SHA extensions in the x86 architecture. It adds a new feature flag, X86_FEATURE_SHA_NI, which represents the SHA1/SHA256 Instruction Extensions.

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   No, this patch does not fix a bug. Instead, it adds support for a new feature.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does the patch address a real security issue?
   It is unclear from the provided information whether this patch addresses a specific security issue. The patch adds support for Intel SHA extensions, which provide accelerated computation of SHA-1 and SHA-256. However, without further details on any security vulnerabilities or exploits that this patch aims to mitigate, it is difficult to determine if it addresses a real security issue.

4. Does the patch address an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not appear to address any problematic or undesirable behavior.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   Based on the provided information, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any significant issues. Additionally, it is unclear if it addresses a real security issue. Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the error message in the l2c310_of_parse() function in the ARM architecture. The patch changes the error message from "PL310 OF: cache setting yield illegal associativity" to "L2C-310 OF cache associativity %d invalid, only 8 or 16 permitted". 

While this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving the error message. However, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only involves a spelling change and does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to setting the IRQ thread policy without checking CAP_SYS_NICE. The patch replaces the use of sched_setscheduler() with sched_setscheduler_nocheck() to omit the CAP_SYS_NICE check for the SCHED_OTHER policy.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

From the patch description, it seems that the issue being addressed is related to the thread's priority not being set correctly in certain scenarios, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. While this may not directly cause a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a hang, it can still be considered a critical bug as it affects the correct functioning of the IRQ thread.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided fix, it is reasonable to conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can impact the system's behavior and does not contain any trivial fixes.

However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and review by kernel maintainers, is necessary to make a final determination.

The failing tests indicate that the issue has a real impact and needs to be addressed. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, adding credibility to its effectiveness.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the dma_mmap() function in the IOMMU-based dma-mapping implementation. The patch adds a missing range check for mmap parameters, specifically the offset and buffer size, to prevent access beyond the allocated buffer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to access beyond the allocated buffer. This falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue, which is a valid reason for accepting a patch in -stable releases.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to size updates for asynchronous I/O (AIO) writes in the NFS (Network File System) implementation. The patch ensures that the inode size is correctly updated after a successful AIO write operation.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, it fixes a bug related to incorrect size updates for AIO writes in NFS.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the patch does not directly mention any of these issues, incorrect size updates can potentially lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific bug.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a real and critical bug related to the WRITE_SAME commands failing with -EPERM when the SG_IO ioctl() is executed without CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability. This issue can be reproduced and observed in certain scenarios, such as with QEMU KVM guests using 'scsi-block' devices.

The patch adds the WRITE_SAME commands to the blk_cmd_filter write_ok list, allowing the SG_IO ioctl() to finish successfully. This resolves the observed SCSI I/O errors and ensures that the WRITE_SAME commands behave consistently with other commands like WRITE_VERIFY.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and is reported by multiple individuals, including a reviewer, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can lead to a null-pointer dereference and a kernel panic. The bug occurs when the firewire-sbp2 module is removed before a login operation to a target completes. 

The patch addresses this issue by canceling pending work for each unit in the sbp2_remove() function, ensuring that there are no extra references preventing the module from unloading. 

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a kernel panic, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the incorrect re-injection of STP packets in the bridge module. The patch addresses the problem by learning the packet's source MAC address and injecting it back into the Rx path for further processing by the packet handlers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the incorrect re-injection of STP packets, which can cause problems with the kernel's STP functionality.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the incorrect re-injection of STP packets can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially impact the stability and security of the system.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch addresses a specific issue and does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can impact the stability and security of the system without including any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch reverts a previous commit (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493) that caused problems on the GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link.

The changes made by the patch include:
1. In stmmac_mdio_register function:
   - The mdio_node variable is set to NULL.
   - A loop is added to iterate over child nodes of priv->device->of_node.
   - If a child node with compatible property "snps,dwmac-mdio" is found, mdio_node is set to that child node.

2. In stmmac_probe_config_dt function:
   - The child_node variable is removed.
   - The loop that iterates over child nodes of np is removed.
   - The condition for setting plat->mdio_bus_data is modified. If plat->phy_bus_name is not NULL, plat->mdio_bus_data is set to NULL.

3. In include/linux/stmmac.h:
   - The mdio_node variable is removed from the plat_stmmacenet_data structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch reverts a previous commit that caused issues with certain boards when connected to a real transceiver. The changes made in the patch seem to address the issue by modifying the handling of mdio_node and plat->mdio_bus_data.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause connectivity issues on specific hardware configurations, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) cipher handle in the drbg_healthcheck_sanity() function. The patch just removes the test for generating random numbers before initialization.

Since the patch is removing a test that was already deemed inappropriate and unnecessary in previous patches, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial change and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the PCI config address for DDW (Dynamic DMA Window) in the powerpc/pseries architecture. The patch modifies the calculation of the cfg_addr variable to ensure it follows the correct format specified by the PAPR (Power Architecture Platform Reference) specification.

The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, and it has been tested and reported by Guilherme G. Piccoli. Additionally, it has been signed-off by Gavin Shan and Michael Ellerman.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the PCI config address in the powerpc/pseries architecture. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error related to the mc13xxx regulator modular build. The patch exports the necessary symbols "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" to prevent build failures on sparc64 when mc13xxx-regulator-core.c and the actual drivers are built into separate modules.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. It also does not introduce any new functionality or improvements. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that causes a hang and a timeout error when setting configuration for gadgets with mass storage function. The patch clears the already_seen flag for ep0 separately, which is not included in the ep_list inside the gadget structure.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue that can lead to a timeout error and improves the stability and functionality of the affected gadgets.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses an issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair.
2. The issue occurs when MTU probing is enabled, and the MSS (Maximum Segment Size) is not set before the connect() function is called.
3. The patch ensures that MTU probing is reinitialized when setting the MSS in a TCP repair.
4. It adds a call to the tcp_mtup_init() function to reinitialize MTU probing when the TCPOPT_MSS option is set.
5. The patch modifies the tcp_repair_options_est() function to take a generic sock pointer instead of a tcp_sock pointer.
6. It updates the function to retrieve the tcp_sock pointer from the generic sock pointer.
7. The patch sets the MSS clamp value and calls tcp_mtup_init() when the TCPOPT_MSS option is received.
8. The patch is signed-off by the authors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair. It does not seem to introduce any trivial changes or non-critical fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of some variables from `unsigned int` to `size_t`. This change is made in the `gfs2_extent_length` and `gfs2_bmap_alloc` functions in the `fs/gfs2/bmap.c` file.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the change from `unsigned int` to `size_t` does not seem to be necessary for the functionality of the code.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The udf_next_aext() function can potentially loop forever for a corrupted filesystem. This can lead to a hang or data corruption, which qualifies as a critical bug.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit and fixes shortcomings in the pci_restore_state() function. It ensures that the restoration of Base Address Registers (BARs) is retried only for Type 0 configuration headers, which is the correct behavior. Type 1 and Type 2 headers have different layouts, and retrying the restoration of BARs for those headers doesn't make sense.

The patch modifies the pci_restore_config_space() function to handle the restoration of BARs based on the header type. For Type 0 headers, it restores BARs before the command register, while for other header types, it restores the entire configuration space.

The patch includes a Tested-by tag, indicating that it has been tested by Mikko Vinni. This adds credibility to the patch.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue, improves the behavior of the pci_restore_state() function, and has been tested. Therefore, it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The patch description mentions that the Software Developer's Manual (SDM) states that exiting SMM from 64-bit mode is invalid. However, the code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0). The goal is to enable exiting from 64-bit mode to real mode by clearing CS.L and CR4.PCIDE.

The patch includes the following changes:
1. Checking if the vCPU supports long mode and performing additional steps if it does.
2. Zeroing CR4.PCIDE before CR0.PG.
3. Setting up a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA if in long mode.
4. Clearing CR4.PAE before clearing EFER.LME.
5. Finally, going back to 32-bit mode.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch aims to enable exiting SMM from 64-bit mode by performing the necessary steps to transition from 64-bit mode to real mode. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted or not without more information.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the madvise_free_huge_pmd function, which is responsible for handling the freeing of huge pages. The bug causes the fallback PTE operations to be skipped after splitting a Transparent Huge Page (THP) successfully.

4. The patch is specific to a V4 superblock: The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the behavior exists on a V4 superblock. This means that the patch is targeted at a specific scenario and does not introduce unnecessary changes for other cases.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug in the irq_domain_add() function, specifically in the sanity check for already initialized irq_domain.
2. The patch splits the check for irq_data == NULL and adds a separate warning for it, improving code readability and maintainability.
3. The patch includes proper attribution and sign-offs from relevant individuals.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to errors or issues in the Linux kernel. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue: The patch resolves an infinite loop issue that occurs when the Exynos DRM driver is enabled and a multi-platform kernel is used. This indicates that there is a real problem that needs to be fixed.

2. The issue can cause a hang: The patch mentions that the infinite loop issue can cause a hang. A hang is a critical issue that can impact system stability and usability.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on resolving the specific issue at hand.

4. The patch does not introduce security vulnerabilities: Although the patch does not explicitly mention security issues, it does not introduce any changes that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.

5. The patch is temporary: The patch acknowledges that it is a temporary solution and will be replaced with a more generic approach in the future. However, this does not necessarily disqualify it from being accepted in a stable release, as long as it effectively resolves the issue at hand.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes two audio bugs in the hdpvr driver.
2. The first bug is related to the audio encoding change, where the driver incorrectly calls hdpvr_set_audio with the current opt->audio_input value instead of opt->audio_input + 1. This bug has always been present.
3. The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and affects the default_audio_input module option handling. If default_audio_input is set to 2 (SPDIF input), the audio encoding is never switched to AC3.
4. Additionally, starting from kernel 3.10, the audio encoding is always set at the start, causing the first bug to always occur when the driver is loaded. Previously, this bug would only surface if the user changed the audio encoding after the driver was loaded.
5. The patch also fixes a trivial typo, changing "bufffer" to "buffer".

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes two audio bugs, one of which has been present since the driver's inception, and the other was introduced in kernel 3.10. These bugs can potentially cause audio issues and impact user experience. Additionally, the patch includes a trivial typo fix, which can improve code readability.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the trace_marker file adds the trace mark to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer.

2. Impact: This issue does not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the intended behavior of the trace_marker file.

3. Patch Analysis:
   - The patch introduces a new variable `tr` of type `struct trace_array` to hold the instance's buffer.
   - The `tr` variable is assigned the value of `filp->private_data`, which is expected to be a pointer to the instance's buffer.
   - The assignment `buffer = tr->trace_buffer.buffer` ensures that the trace mark is added to the correct buffer.

4. Overall Assessment: Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to the trace_marker file. While it may not address a critical bug or a security issue, it does correct an incorrect behavior that could lead to confusion or unexpected results.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug, a security issue, or a build error. Additionally, it can be considered a relatively trivial fix as it addresses a specific behavior of the trace_marker file.

Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch avoids a duplicate call to the function iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn() for ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE within the functions isert_map_rdma() and isert_reg_rdma_frwr(). This duplicate call is unnecessary since it is already being called once during the isert_put_datain() -> iscsit_build_rsp_pdu() operation.

2. The patch removes the local conn->stat_sn assignment and increment. This suggests that the stat_sn value should be handled by the iscsi_target_mode code instead.

3. The patch changes the third parameter of the iscsit_build_rsp_pdu() function to signal that the stat_sn handling should be done by the iscsi_target_mode code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue of duplicate function calls and improving the handling of stat_sn value. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the changes made by the patch seem to be more of an optimization rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement for the render backends in the DRM Radeon driver. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. 

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of the controller's lock during gadget resume in the USB DWC3 driver. The patch ensures that the lock is released before calling the gadget resume function and then reacquired afterward.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior during gadget resume. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it could result in incorrect functionality.

Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the `of_get_display_timings()` function in the `drivers/video/of_display_timing.c` file. The patch correctly adds a `kfree(dt)` statement to free the memory allocated for `dt` in case `of_parse_display_timing()` fails.

Considering that a memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability, this patch addresses a real and critical bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend (B) not accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is a revert of a previous commit that claimed throughput improvement for MSC/UVC. However, the author states that they did not observe significant improvement in throughput.

2. The patch introduces regressions, including a complete breakage of the ASIX usb-ethernet dongle on UDP RX and console log flooding with error messages when unplugging a 3G modem.

3. The patch removes the HCD_BH flag, which is responsible for handling urb return in the bottom half. This flag is not trivial and its removal may have unintended consequences.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch does not fix a critical bug or address a real issue. Instead, it introduces regressions and removes functionality that may be necessary for proper operation. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced in the previous fix commit. The regression caused a bug where rfkill notification to user-space was broken when compiled without CONFIG_RFKILL. The patch addresses this issue by resetting the firmware after rfkill is turned off.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a specific scenario related to rfkill notification and compilation options.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to grabbing crtc mutexes in the function `intel_modeset_gem_init()` in the `intel_display.c` file of the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the i915 driver.

2. The patch explains that when the pipe A force quirk is applied, the code attempts to grab a crtc mutex during `intel_modeset_setup_hw_state()`. However, if all crtc mutexes are already held, this will result in a deadlock.

3. To avoid the deadlock, the patch suggests replacing the usage of `drm_modeset_lock_all()` with `mutex_lock(&dev->mode_config.mutex)`. This change is expected to prevent the unlocked mutex warnings from certain lower-level functions.

4. The patch also provides information about the regression introduced by commit `027476642811f8559cbe00ef6cc54db230e48a20`, which added the requirement to take modeset locks around `intel_modeset_setup_hw_state()`.

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and also includes a CC to the stable mailing list, indicating that it is intended for consideration in stable releases.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to potential deadlocks and provides a targeted fix without introducing any trivial changes.

This change is not a trivial fix as it affects the control flow and ensures that xmon is properly notified.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug, does not contain trivial fixes, and improves the functionality of the xmon data-breakpoint feature in the powerpc architecture.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock in the IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) subsystem when overlayfs is used. The bug is reported by Krisztian Litkey and the patch is signed-off by Miklos Szeredi.

The patch modifies the code in the ima_appraise_measurement() and ima_update_xattr() functions in the ima_appraise.c file, as well as the process_measurement() function in the ima_main.c file.

The patch replaces the usage of file->f_path.dentry with the file_dentry() function, which is a helper function that returns the dentry associated with the file. This change ensures that the correct dentry is used when calling ->setxattr() on overlayfs, preventing the deadlock.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that can lead to a deadlock, and the fix itself does not appear to be trivial. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals.

Please note that the final decision should be made by the Linux kernel maintainers and the stable release maintainers based on their expertise and policies.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the ipv6 module related to the allocation of icmp6_dst. The bug was reported by Dave Jones and the patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and David S. Miller.

The patch itself adds an error handling path in the icmp6_dst_alloc() function. Previously, if the idev variable was NULL, the function would return NULL, which could lead to crashes in mld_sendpack(). The patch changes this behavior and returns ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) instead.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fact that it can lead to crashes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues in the ipv6 module.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug report states that when DDW (64-bit direct DMA on Power) is not enabled for NVMe devices, a fallback to 32-bit DMA via the IOMMU occurs, which uses 4K TCEs. However, the NVMe device driver assumes that the DMA alignment for the PRP entries matches the device's page size, which can be different from the kernel's page size on Power architecture. This inconsistency leads to a BUG_ON condition in nvme_setup_prps().

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch suggests defaulting the NVMe device page size to 4K, using the IOMMU's page size instead of the kernel's page size. This ensures that the DMA alignment matches the device's page size, resolving the issue.

3. The patch has been tested: The patch author mentions that with the functionally equivalent v3 of this patch, their hardware test exerciser survives when using 32-bit DMA. Without the patch, the kernel would encounter a BUG within a few minutes. This indicates that the patch has been tested and verified to address the bug.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch focuses on fixing a critical bug and does not include trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to fix the critical bug related to NVMe device page size alignment.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the sata_mv driver. The patch adds an error check for the return value of devm_ioremap, which can be NULL if the function fails. If devm_ioremap fails, the patch returns -ENOMEM, indicating an out-of-memory error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the fix does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue in the spc_emulate_evpd_b3() function in the target_core_spc.c file. The patch corrects a cut and paste error where the lba_map_segment_size was being used twice for the Referrals VPD. 

The patch replaces the second usage of lba_map_segment_size with lba_map_segment_multiplier, which suggests that the correct user data segment multiplier should be set instead of the user data segment size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the Referrals VPD.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   Yes, the bug causes the sysfs to report the cable as present when it is not, which can lead to incorrect network status information.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any new issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the devfreq subsystem. The patch changes the allocation of memory for the devfreq statistics data structure to use the devfreq device pointer instead of the parent device pointer. This change ensures that the allocated memory is properly freed when the devfreq is disabled at runtime.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to resource leakage, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the ALSA USB audio driver for the MAYA44 USB(+) device. The driver currently aborts parsing too early when encountering an error in the mixer unit descriptor, which leads to missing capture mixer controls. This bug can be considered a "real and critical" issue as it affects the functionality of the audio device.

The patch fixes the issue by moving the check for the descriptor error after the parsing of the unit's input pins. This ensures that the other units connected to this unit are properly parsed, preventing the missing capture mixer controls.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer exception in the extcon-max8997 driver when platform data is not supplied. This bug could potentially lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause a hang or an oops. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the RTC tracking code in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module.

2. The issue is that if the rtc_status.pending_eoi becomes negative, it triggers WARN_ONs, but these warnings do not recover from the issue.

3. The patch introduces a new function called rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid, which checks if pending_eoi is negative and calls kvm_rtc_eoi_tracking_restore_all to recompute a correct dest_map and pending_eoi.

4. The patch also modifies the existing function __rtc_irq_eoi_tracking_restore_one to call rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid after decrementing pending_eoi.

5. Additionally, the patch modifies the function rtc_irq_eoi to call rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid after decrementing pending_eoi.

6. Finally, the patch adds a comment in the function ioapic_service to clarify that pending_eoi cannot become negative and that the BUG_ON check is only called if rtc_irq_check_coalesced returns false.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue in the RTC tracking code and provides a recovery mechanism to avoid further problems. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and is focused on fixing a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that attempted to fix a reported issue with the "capacity_now" value being higher than the "full_charge_capacity" value when the battery is fully charged.

2. The patch author argues that it is not unexpected for "capacity_now" to increase above "full_charge_capacity" due to variations in charging cycles and battery firmware behavior. Good battery firmwares may update "full_charge_capacity" when the current charging cycle is complete, even increasing it if necessary.

3. The patch claims that capping "capacity_now" to "full_charge_capacity" is incorrect and that printing a warning if they don't match the "design_capacity" is both annoying and wrong.

4. The patch explains that the current behavior results in bogus warnings on perfectly working systems/firmwares and incorrect values being reported for "capacity_now" and "full_charge_capacity" after the warning has been triggered.

5. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag referencing the previous commit that introduced the issue.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Bjørn Mork and Rafael J. Wysocki.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue with incorrect battery capacity reporting and fixes the problem introduced by the previous commit. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK).

Considering the patch description and the reported panic found during a stress test, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to system instability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the number of PWM channels in the LPC32xx SoC. The patch correctly sets the number of PWM channels to 1 instead of 2, which aligns with the hardware configuration of the SoC.

The patch description explains that the two PWM controllers in the SoC have different clock parents, clock gates, and controls. Incorrectly setting the number of PWM channels to 2 prevents separate configuration of different clock parents and gates for each PWM controller.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific issue related to the hardware configuration and ensures proper functionality of the PWM controllers on the LPC32xx SoC.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a problem in the xhci-hcd's resume routine, which suggests that it addresses a real and critical bug.
2. The patch resolves a race condition where the controller might be put back to sleep before it can activate its IRQ line, potentially causing the wakeup condition to never be handled.
3. The patch simplifies the logic in xhci_resume by combining some repeated flag settings into a single pair of statements, improving code readability and maintainability.
4. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Alan Stern, Greg Kroah-Hartman, and Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.
5. The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a sparse fix for the drivers/of/platform.c file. The patch changes the type of the "reg" variable from "const u32 *" to "const __be32 *". 

The patch itself does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be addressing a warning generated by the sparse static analyzer tool.

Since the patch does not fix a critical issue and only addresses a warning, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. 

Based on this analysis, the Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an unbalanced mutex issue in the dma_pool_create() function. The bug was introduced in the 3.16 kernel version. 

The patch correctly addresses the issue by unlocking the mutex in the error case. It replaces the previous return statement with assigning NULL to the retval variable before unlocking the mutex.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) on the arm64 architecture. The bug causes a regression in the coarse clock monotonicity. 

The patch addresses the issue by modifying the update_vsyscall function in the vdso.c file. It replaces the usage of __current_kernel_time() with the timekeeper object provided by the timekeeping core. This ensures that the coarse time is derived correctly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that affects the arm64 architecture, specifically related to the VDSO and coarse clock monotonicity. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro to export module alias information for the "b53_mmap" driver. This change allows user-space to match the registered device with the corresponding module when the driver is built as a module.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a kernel crash when unloading the i2c-hid driver. The crash occurs because the command buffer is released in the i2c_hid_stop() function, but the i2c-hid driver tries to send a PWR_SLEEP command after the buffer has been freed.

The patch removes the call to i2c_hid_free_buffers() from the i2c_hid_stop() function, ensuring that the buffers are only freed when the i2c-hid driver itself is removed.

Considering that the bug leads to a kernel crash and the patch addresses the issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Summary:
The patch aims to fix a regression issue related to suspending the graphics memory management unit (GTT) mappings in the Intel i915 driver. It flushes the page table entries (PTEs) before suspending to ensure that the hardware TLBs are properly updated.

2. Patch Analysis:
The patch addresses a specific bug that causes harm even after previous attempts to fix it. It introduces a new function, i915_ggtt_flush(), which is responsible for flushing the TLBs based on the hardware generation. For pre-Gen6 hardware, it calls intel_gtt_chipset_flush(), while for Gen6 and newer hardware, it writes to the GFX_FLSH_CNTL_GEN6 register.

3. Bug Impact:
The bug being fixed is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description. However, it is stated that the issue causes harm and has been reported in Bugzilla. Without further information, it is difficult to assess the exact impact of the bug.

4. Fix Justification:
The patch addresses a regression issue that has survived previous attempts to fix it. It introduces a specific fix for the issue by flushing the PTEs before suspending. This fix is directly related to the bug being reported and aims to prevent any potential issues caused by outdated TLB entries.

5. Code Quality:
The patch appears to be well-written and focused on the specific issue at hand. It introduces a new function to handle the TLB flushing, which improves code modularity and maintainability.

6. Patch Size:
The patch is relatively small and does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a regression issue, introduces a specific fix, and improves code modularity. However, it is important to consider the severity and impact of the bug being fixed before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the IPI domain in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a crash when ipi_destroy() is called on a multi-cpu system, as it attempts to free cpumask_weight() IRQs that were never allocated. 

The patch sets the IRQ_NO_BALANCING flag to prevent the affinity from being overwritten by setup_affinity(), ensuring that the affinity mask is not modified before the IPI is destroyed. This fix addresses the issue and prevents the crash.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch aims to modify the behavior of acpi_find_child_device() function in the ACPI/scan module. Currently, if there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope, the first one found to be present is returned. However, this behavior is not defined by the spec, and it may not match the ASL writers' expectations.

The patch suggests modifying the find_child_checks() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change would make devices without valid ACPI/PNP device IDs look less attractive, allowing other devices with the same _ADR value (that may not have a valid device ID) to be matched going forward.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific case where devices with invalid ACPI/PNP device IDs should be matched differently. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is a port of a previous fix for ARMv7 to ARMv8. It fixes the broken evtype mask to include the NSH bit, allowing profiling at EL2.

2. Impact: The patch addresses a bug in the ARMv8 architecture that affects event selection for profiling. Without this fix, profiling at EL2 would not be possible.

3. Criticality: The bug addressed by the patch does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does fix an issue that affects the functionality of profiling at EL2, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

4. Triviality: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix for a functionality issue. While it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug, it does address an important functionality problem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a memory leak issue on resume_latency.notifiers. The original behavior of freeing the notifiers pointer on qos->resume_latency is restored, which is used and necessary to prevent memory leaks.

2. The kmemleak warning indicates an unreferenced object, which suggests a potential memory leak. By freeing the notifiers pointer, this warning is fixed, indicating that the patch resolves a real and critical bug.

3. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue. This indicates that the patch is specifically targeting a known problem.

4. The patch is signed-off by John Keeping and Rafael J. Wysocki, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the usbvision driver. The patch checks the number of endpoints before accessing the endpoint array to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, my analysis is as follows:

1. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock from the imx-tve driver in the imx-drm subsystem.
2. The patch explains that the enable_lock is unnecessary because DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions.
3. The patch also mentions that holding a spinlock while calling clk_prepare_enable() is incorrect and can cause a might_sleep() warning.
4. The patch is signed-off by Russell King and Acked-by Sascha Hauer.
5. The patch is also signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch removes unnecessary code and resolves potential issues with the enable_lock spinlock. It does not appear to introduce any new bugs or trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is related to the stk-webcam driver in the media subsystem.

2. The patch description explains that the USB control messages require DMA (Direct Memory Access) to work properly. It states that passing a stack-allocated buffer is not safe because it cannot be guaranteed that the stack is located in a DMA-enabled area.

3. The patch author is Mauro Carvalho Chehab, and there are two signed-off lines indicating the author's affiliation.

4. Looking at the code changes, we can see that a new buffer, "buf," is allocated using kmalloc. The size of the buffer is sizeof(u8), which is equivalent to 1 byte.

5. If the allocation fails, the function returns -ENOMEM, indicating an out-of-memory error.

6. The usb_control_msg function is called with the allocated buffer "buf" as the data buffer parameter instead of the previously used stack-allocated buffer "(u8 *) value." The size of the buffer is sizeof(u8), and the timeout is set to 500 milliseconds.

7. If the usb_control_msg function call succeeds (returns a non-negative value), the value in the buffer "buf" is copied to the "value" variable using memcpy.

8. The allocated buffer "buf" is freed using kfree.

9. The function returns the result of the usb_control_msg function call, which could be a negative error code or the number of bytes transferred.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a potential issue with DMA usage in the stk-webcam driver, ensuring that a stack-allocated buffer is not used for DMA operations. This fix is important to prevent potential data corruption or other issues related to DMA.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to NFSv4 and the function `nfs4_proc_lookup_mountpoint`.
2. The issue is that the return value of `rpc_clone_client()` is not checked, and the cloned `rpc_clnt` is not shut down in case of a specific error condition (`NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC`), leading to a memory leak.
3. The patch fixes both issues by moving the call to `rpc_clone_client()` after `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` has completed its operations.
4. The patch includes a reported-by tag and a signed-off-by tag, indicating that the issue has been reported and the patch has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to memory leaks and improves the code by simplifying it.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to improve SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) balancing by avoiding select_idle_sibling() from picking a sibling thread if there is an idle core that shares cache. This fix addresses the common case where there is a shared cache core available for balancing.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. It introduces a new variable `smt` to track whether SMT balancing is needed.
2. It adds a label `again` to allow re-iteration in case SMT balancing is required.
3. It modifies the for_each_domain loop to skip domains that have SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER set and `smt` is not set.
4. It adds a new loop to iterate through sched_groups within a domain.
5. It checks if the sched_group intersects with the allowed CPUs of the task.
6. It checks if all CPUs in the sched_group are idle.
7. It selects the first available CPU from the sched_group as the target.
8. It adds a label `next` to continue to the next sched_group if the current one is not suitable.
9. It updates the target CPU if a suitable CPU is found.
10. It adds a label `done` to exit the loop once a suitable CPU is found.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to SMT balancing. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

2. The patch introduces a new helper function called "nvme_set_queue_limits" that sets the queue limits for the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This is important because without this helper function, the command size on the admin queue is arbitrarily low, which can lead to issues.

3. The helper function sets various queue limits based on the device-specific parameters of the nvme_ctrl structure. These limits include the maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush requirements, and virtual boundary.

4. The helper function is called in two places: during the initialization of the Identify data and controller registers, and during the allocation of a new namespace. This ensures that the queue limits are properly set for both the admin queue and the I/O queues.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch addresses a real issue related to setting queue limits for the admin queue in the NVMe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is not a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the OMAP4/5/DRA7 clock drivers. The patch description explains that when the "gpmc_fck" clock is used in the gpmc.c file, it results in misconfigured timings and devices being lost on the bus due to divisions by zero.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug that causes misconfigured timings and device loss on the bus.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, misconfigured timings and device loss on the bus can be considered as "oh, that's not good" issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It specifically removes the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the relevant clock drivers.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to misconfigured timings and device loss on the bus, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for defining and using an explicit "CONNECTED" state in the libceph module. The patch adds the CONNECTED state and updates the relevant code to set and clear this state appropriately.

From the description, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new state to better represent the connection status.

Therefore, this patch seems to be a "trivial" fix that does not address any critical issue. As per the guidelines, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the USB gadget serial driver. The patch adds a check for the 'port->port_usb' pointer before accessing it to avoid the crash.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential hang or crash issue, which qualifies as a real and critical bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects an allocation size issue in the watchdog core. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The current implementation of `intel_check_page_flip()` uses `in_irq()` to check for hard-IRQ context only. However, if the system is run with the kernel 'threadirqs' option selected, this test generates lots of warnings because it gets called in soft-IRQ context. This bug can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected warnings.

2. The patch uses `in_interrupt()` instead of `in_irq()`: By using `in_interrupt()`, the patch allows for either type of interrupt context, which is more appropriate for the intended functionality. This change ensures that the page flip code is not misused when called from non-interrupt context.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, who are both associated with Intel. This indicates that the patch has undergone a thorough review process and has received approval from experts in the field.

4. The patch includes a reference to a bug report: The patch includes a reference to a Bugzilla bug report (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321), which provides additional context and justification for the fix.

Based on these factors, the patch addresses a real and critical bug, improves the code's correctness, and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. The patch aims to use the stored `max_vddc` value instead of looking it up manually each time when parsing the power tables.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ni_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `ni_dpm.c` and the `rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `rv770_dpm.c`. These functions are responsible for parsing power-related information.

2. The patch removes the variable `vddc` from both functions, as it is no longer needed.

3. In both functions, there is a check for `pl->vddc` being equal to `0xff01`. If this condition is true, the patch replaces the previous code that looked up the `max_vddc` value with a new check for `pi->max_vddc`. If `pi->max_vddc` is non-zero, it assigns its value to `pl->vddc`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. It does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable. It may work for some people with specific USB host controllers, but for others, it causes the device to sleep and not wake up for important events like HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request.

The patch explains that there were attempts to fix this issue for some people by patching the xHCI USB controller, but it didn't work for everyone. It suggests that the problem could be in the USB subsystem, USB host controllers, or even a hardware issue. Since the cause is unknown, the safest action is to revert the patch.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical issue that can cause important events to be missed and that the previous attempt to fix it was not successful, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is fixing the length calculation for ethtool statistics in the qlcnic driver. While it is important to have accurate length calculations, this patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic error in the original implementation of clock disable logic in the sdhi and mmcif drivers. The patch changes the bitwise AND operator to a bitwise OR operator in order to correctly disable the clock to the respective hardware blocks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch corrects a logic error in the clock disable logic, which can potentially cause issues with the hardware blocks.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the logic error can lead to incorrect clock handling, which can impact the functionality and stability of the system.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch addresses a logic error and is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix the wrong minimal dump size obtained from the rtnl_calcit() function in RT netlink. Currently, the function does not account for the size of the header of the netlink message, and this patch aims to fix that.

2. Impact: The issue addressed by the patch does not seem to cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an internal correctness issue related to the calculation of the minimal dump size for netlink messages.

3. Triviality: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to the calculation of the minimal dump size.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix that does not address a critical bug or a real issue that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "xHCI: Clear PLC for USB2 root hub ports." It aims to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function.

2. Purpose of the Patch:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of USB2 root hub ports. Currently, the PLC is cleared for USB3 root hub ports but not for USB2 ports. This patch aims to clear the PLC for USB2 root hub ports as well.

3. Patch Details:
   The patch modifies the handle_port_status() function in the xHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) driver. It adds a conditional check to clear the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports if the speed of the host controller is not HCD_USB3.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to the handling of the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential inconsistency in the behavior between USB2 and USB3 root hub ports.

   However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue this patch aims to fix, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem it addresses. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential impact of the patch on system stability, performance, and compatibility.

5. Recommendation:
   Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further analysis and testing are required to evaluate the patch's impact on system behavior and its effectiveness in addressing the reported issue.

   It is recommended to conduct thorough testing and review the patch in the context of the specific bug or issue it aims to fix. Additionally, it would be beneficial to gather feedback from other Linux kernel developers and experts to ensure the patch meets the necessary criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided, and a more comprehensive evaluation may be required for a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in the USB gadget driver. The issue is caused by the premature assignment of the 'gadget' variable before the waiting process is completed. This can lead to a potential crash or other unexpected behavior.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a crash or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to a non-existent VGA port on a Fujitsu D3003-S2 board. The bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists a VGA port that does not actually exist.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch:

1. The bug being fixed is a real and critical issue: Yes, the bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists a non-existent VGA port, which can cause confusion and potential issues.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It specifically adds a connector quirk for the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function call in the lpc_eth.c driver. The change replaces the deprecated function `dev_hw_addr_random()` with the new function `eth_hw_addr_random()`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to inject a #GP (General Protection) exception when a guest sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value.

The patch introduces a new function called `kvm_mtrr_valid` in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c` and `arch/x86/kvm/x86.h` files. This function checks the validity of the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) for the given MSR (Model-Specific Register) and data. It ensures that the MTRR type is within the valid range (0, 1, 4, 5, 6) and that the mask is properly aligned.

The patch modifies the `vmx_set_msr` function in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c` to call `kvm_mtrr_valid` before setting the PAT CR value. If the MTRR is not valid, the function returns an error code (1).

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue where an invalid value for the PAT CR could cause problems in the guest. It introduces a necessary check to ensure the validity of the MTRR before setting the PAT CR value.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to potential data corruption or security issues in the KVM module.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to power-saving (PS) idle behavior in the ath9k wireless driver. The patch corrects an inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK, ensuring that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission (tx) is pending.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug in the power-saving functionality of the ath9k driver.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? No, the patch does not address a security vulnerability.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK can lead to incorrect behavior in power-saving mode, which can impact the overall performance and reliability of the wireless driver.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not include trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause incorrect behavior in power-saving mode, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel oops triggered by dereferencing a NULL Rx skb. This issue occurs when a non-link packet is detected in a non-active state, causing the h5_reset_rx() function to free the Rx skb and not return, leading to the subsequent h5_rx_payload() call to encounter a NULL skb.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential kernel oops, it can be categorized as fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and the time difference is just a little larger than half a buffer time. In such cases, the current implementation incorrectly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

The patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to the comparison with `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change accounts for the potential inaccuracy of `jiffies`, which is not a high-resolution timer.

Considering the nature of the patch, it appears to fix a potential issue that could lead to incorrect handling of interrupts. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue, it addresses a situation that could result in unexpected behavior. Therefore, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Hence, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch description states that the encoding of metadata was using the padded length instead of the real length, which is a bug per specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all specified metadata has been 32-bit, where aligned and data length are the same width.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, it is mentioned that we are fine to include it here.

3. The patch fixes the encoding of metadata by using the real length instead of the padded length. It replaces the magic number with the actual data length.

4. The patch also includes a fix for validating the length of a u16 field. It checks if the length is equal to the size of u16.

5. The patch includes changes in the tcf_ife_decode function, where it correctly calculates the aligned length of metadata and adjusts the pointer accordingly.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata and includes necessary validations. Although the bug has not caused any issues so far, it is important to adhere to the specification and ensure correct encoding.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to USB Link Power Management (LPM) functionality in the Linux kernel. The bug causes the LPM feature to be non-functional due to the lack of setting the "lpm_capable" field for the root hub device.

The patch adds code to check and set the "lpm_capable" field when registering a root hub device, ensuring that LPM is functional. It is mentioned that this patch can be back-ported to kernels as old as v3.15, which indicates that it is a stable fix.

Considering the nature of the bug and the importance of maintaining proper USB functionality, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to ACPI / EC interrupts. The patch ensures that a SCI (System Control Interrupt) is not counted as a false interrupt in certain cases.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue related to interrupt handling in the ACPI / EC subsystem.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not directly address any of these issues. It focuses on correctly identifying SCI interrupts and not counting them as false interrupts.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a conditional check based on the SCI flag to determine whether an interrupt should be counted.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). While it may not address a critical issue causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does fix a specific problem related to interrupt handling in the ACPI / EC subsystem.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to prevent unfinished touch events from competing with pen events on tablets that support both pen and touch input. It ensures that if the pen comes in proximity while touch is down, touch is forced up before sending pen events.

2. Impact:
   This patch addresses a potential issue where unfinished touch events could interfere with pen events on tablets that support both input methods. If left unaddressed, this could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior when using the pen input.

3. Bug Severity:
   The bug addressed by this patch does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it can result in incorrect behavior when using the pen input on tablets.

4. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific issue at hand.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential improvement rather than a critical bug fix. While it addresses an issue that can lead to incorrect behavior, it does not fall under the criteria of a critical bug that would cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it could be considered for inclusion in future non-stable releases or distributions that prioritize stability improvements.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug related to manipulating the FDT (Flattened Device Tree) with the MMU (Memory Management Unit) disabled in certain AArch64 UEFI implementations. This can result in alignment faults and is not compliant with the UEFI spec.

The patch moves the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that the FDT manipulation occurs in a more appropriate place and avoids the risk associated with disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices().

Given that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to alignment faults and non-compliance with the UEFI spec, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch corrects the vsync configuration sequence in the DRM Exynos mixer driver.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the code in the `mixer_enable_vblank`, `mixer_disable_vblank`, and `mixer_enable` functions in the `exynos_mixer.c` file.

3. Analysis:
   a. The patch adds a new line of code to clear the vsync indicator before configuring vsync in the `mixer_enable_vblank` function. This ensures that the vsync interrupt is properly enabled.
   b. The patch also adds a new line of code to clear the vsync interrupt status in the `mixer_disable_vblank` function before disabling the vsync interrupt. This ensures that any pending vsync interrupts are cleared.
   c. In the `mixer_enable` function, the patch adds a conditional check to clear the vsync interrupt status if the vsync interrupt is enabled. This ensures that any pending vsync interrupts are cleared before enabling the vsync interrupt.

4. Impact:
   a. The patch addresses a potential issue with the vsync configuration sequence in the DRM Exynos mixer driver.
   b. The issue could potentially lead to incorrect vsync behavior or missed vsync interrupts.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could impact the vsync functionality in the DRM Exynos mixer driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the InfiniBand Connection Manager (CM) implementation. The bug causes potential issues with erasing and freeing the cm_id_priv structure, leading to duplicate free and use-after-free scenarios.

The patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the cm_id_priv structure is erased only once before freeing it. It includes modifications in the cm_destroy_id() and ib_send_cm_sidr_rep() functions.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other critical issues, and the patch addresses it directly without any trivial changes.

Therefore, my analysis suggests that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to support NR_CPUS = 4096 on SPARC64 architecture. Currently, NR_CPUS is limited to 4064 due to the allocation of a single page for NR_CPUS mondo entries in init_cpu_send_mondo_info(). This limitation prevents the use of all 4096 CPUs on certain SPARC platforms.

To fix this issue, the patch suggests allocating (2^order) pages based on the size of cpu_list for possible CPUs. Since cpu_list_pa and cpu_mondo_block_pa are not used in asm code, there are no imm13 offsets from the base PA that will break because they can only reach one page.

The patch also includes a bug fix for the allocation of the cpu_list page and ensures that the mondo block is 64-byte aligned.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that limits the number of usable CPUs on SPARC64 architecture. The patch provides a solution by allocating the necessary pages and fixing the allocation of the cpu_list page. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any potential issues.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not take into account any specific considerations or dependencies within the Linux kernel codebase.
true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to the `fs_info->pending_changes` variable in the Btrfs file system.
2. The bug occurs because the original code uses `cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0)`, which only clears `pending_changes` if it is already 0.
3. This bug causes problems when mounting Btrfs with the `inode_cache` mount option, as `pending_changes` will always be 1, even when the file system is frozen.
4. The patch replaces the `cmpxchg` operation with `xchg` to ensure that `pending_changes` is always cleared.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that can cause issues when mounting Btrfs with the `inode_cache` option, and it does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to PWM fan control in the amdgpu driver. The patch adds a check to skip the creation of sysfs nodes for PWM attributes if DPM (Dynamic Power Management) is not enabled. This is done to prevent potential crashes that could occur if the sysfs nodes were created without DPM support.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue related to sysfs node creation. Additionally, the changes made in the patch can be considered as "trivial" fixes since they involve skipping the creation of certain attributes.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

The patch modifies the function `blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set()` in the `blk-mq.c` file. 

The patch removes the calls to `blk_mq_freeze_queue()` and `blk_mq_unfreeze_queue()` functions from the `blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set()` function. These functions are responsible for freezing and unfreezing the queue before and after deleting the tag set.

The reasoning behind this change is that the queue has already been frozen by `blk_cleanup_queue()` before the `blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set()` function is called, so there is no need to freeze it again.

The patch aims to fix the WARNING message "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" that occurs during unloading the block driver.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue related to the handling of tag sets in the block multi-queue (blk-mq) subsystem. The removal of redundant freeze and unfreeze calls appears to be a valid fix for the warning message.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to setting security labels on NFS. The bug causes setxattr's of security labels over NFSv4.2 to fail. The patch addresses the issue by fixing the logic in selinux_is_sblabel_mnt to include the SECURITY_FS_USE_NATIVE behavior that was introduced for NFS.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes data corruption (setxattr failures) and is specific to NFS, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to clock rate setting in the mxs-mmc driver. The bug caused incorrect clock rate calculations, resulting in an actual clock rate that was significantly different from the expected value. The patch addresses this issue by correctly defining the limits for div1 and div2 and adjusting the clock rate calculation.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to clock rate calculation in the mxs-mmc driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove limits for the amount of system-wide message queues in the Linux kernel. The patch explains that the current limits imposed by commit 93e6f119c0ce are causing issues for userspace applications and workloads.

The patch suggests reverting the limit entirely and falling back to the original way of dealing with queue limits, where once a user's resource limit is reached and all memory is used, new queues cannot be created.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue that affects userspace applications and workloads. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves reverting the limit and changing the way queue limits are handled.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a critical bug that can impact userspace applications and workloads.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a bug introduced in commit f8ec894945e7d205ce62be59e55e72c4304e4739, which caused external users of input_mt_is_used() to break. This bug is considered a real and critical issue.

2. The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug. This helps in tracking the bug and ensuring that the fix is applied to the appropriate code.

3. The bug was reported by Gabriele Mazzotta and tested by the same person, which adds credibility to the bug report and the fix.

4. The patch includes a Reviewed-by tag from Henrik Rydberg, indicating that the fix has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

5. The patch modifies the input_mt_drop_unused() function to call a new internal function __input_mt_drop_unused() instead of duplicating the code. This improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of introducing new bugs.

6. The patch increments the mt->frame counter in both input_mt_drop_unused() and input_mt_sync_frame() functions, ensuring that the frame count is correctly updated.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug without any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to ensuring that the request and response queue addresses are properly written to the registers before use. This can be considered a critical bug as it could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues if the addresses are not properly set.

The patch also includes a memory barrier (wmb()) to ensure the proper ordering of the write operations. This is important for synchronization and consistency purposes.

Considering the nature of the bug being fixed and the inclusion of the memory barrier, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the UniMAC reset in the bcm_sysport_resume() function. The bug can lead to receive FIFO corruptions coming out of a suspend cycle, resulting in corrupted/duplicate packets being delivered towards the host CPU interface. This issue can be reproduced on a crowded network with Wake-on-LAN enabled for the specific interface.

The patch adds the necessary UniMAC reset in the bcm_sysport_resume() function to address the problem. By resetting the UniMAC, it ensures that the receive functionality is properly disabled during the small window when the RDMA and RBUF engines are not ready, preventing packets from getting stuck in the UniMAC RX FIFO and being delivered as corrupted.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and affects the functionality of the network interface, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "ath9k: Fix PS wrappers in ath9k_set_coverage_class". It suggests fixing the power-saving (PS) wrappers in the ath9k_set_coverage_class function.

2. Patch Context:
   The patch explains that the ath9k_set_coverage_class function is called during suspend/resume and via the iw command. It configures parameters like sifs, slottime, acktimeout in ath9k_hw_init_global_settings, where some register reads and register modifications (REG_READ, REG_RMW) are also performed. Therefore, the power-saving (PS) wrappers are needed.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - Line 2283: The ath9k_set_coverage_class function is modified.
     - A call to ath9k_ps_wakeup is added before ath9k_hw_init_global_settings.
     - A call to ath9k_ps_restore is added after ath9k_hw_init_global_settings.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to fix the power-saving (PS) wrappers in the ath9k_set_coverage_class function. The addition of ath9k_ps_wakeup before ath9k_hw_init_global_settings and ath9k_ps_restore after ath9k_hw_init_global_settings suggests that the power-saving state is being properly managed during the configuration of parameters.

   However, without further information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it is not clear if the changes made in this patch are non-trivial or if they fall under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc."

5. Recommendation:
   Based on the available information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further information about the bug being fixed and the significance of the changes made in the patch would be required for a more accurate analysis.

Please provide additional details or context about the bug being fixed or any other relevant information to further evaluate the patch.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to lockdep annotations in the kernfs_deactivate() function. The bug causes uninitialized lockdep_map to be fed to lockdep, triggering a warning. The patch addresses this issue by checking whether the KERNFS_LOCKDEP flag is set before performing lockdep annotations.

Considering that this bug can potentially lead to warnings and may impact the stability and correctness of the system, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that could cause issues such as oops or data corruption. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its contents and purpose.

The patch addresses a failure to open the PCM device with -ENOSYS in the Terratec Phase 88 audio device. The issue is related to the incorrect identification of the Selector Function Blocks responsible for switching the clock source.

Please note that further analysis and testing may be required to ensure the patch's compatibility and effectiveness in the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that allowed PCH PWM override on IVB (Ivy Bridge) hardware. The reason for the revert is that it breaks the backlight controls on an Asus Zenbook with an eDP panel.

Given that the patch is reverting a change that introduced a regression, it seems reasonable to include this patch in a stable release. The issue described, where the backlight controls are broken, can be considered a critical bug as it affects the functionality of the hardware.

Therefore, my analysis is that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing unlock statement in the error handling path of the `net2272_irq()` function in the `net2272.c` file. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the memremap function related to the validity of the PFN (Page Frame Number) passed to pfn_to_page(). The patch adds a check using pfn_valid() to ensure that the PFN is valid before calling pfn_to_page().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves adding a necessary check to ensure the validity of the PFN.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch aims to fix an issue related to the MACB/GEM driver in the Linux kernel. It addresses the problem of incorrect checksums on transmit for UDP packets with a payload size less than or equal to 2 on Zynq.

The patch introduces a new function called `macb_clear_csum` which is responsible for initializing the checksum field to 0 for packets with checksum offloading enabled. It first checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled, and if so, it ensures that the packet header can be modified. Then, it initializes the checksum field to 0.

In the `macb_start_xmit` function, the `macb_clear_csum` function is called before mapping the socket buffer for DMA transfer. If `macb_clear_csum` returns an error, the function frees the socket buffer and returns `NETDEV_TX_OK`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to incorrect checksums on transmit for UDP packets with a specific payload size on Zynq. The patch introduces a necessary initialization of the checksum field to ensure correct results. It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on a critical bug that can lead to data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch description explains that when power management is disabled (CONFIG_PM=n), the code enabling the clock was removed from the probe function, resulting in a dysfunctional gpio controller.

2. The patch aims to put back the clock initialization to support CONFIG_PM=n.

3. The patch includes a Fixes tag, which references a commit that moved the PM initialization earlier to support gpio hogs.

4. The patch also includes a Signed-off-by tag from the patch author and the maintainer.

5. In the code changes, the clock is enabled using the `clk_prepare_enable` function, and if it fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns the error.

6. The patch also sets the device as active and enables runtime PM for the device.

7. After enabling runtime PM, the patch attempts to get the device in sync, and if it fails, an error is returned.

8. If any error occurs during the probe function, the patch disables the runtime PM and disables and unprepares the clock.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a real issue where the gpio controller becomes dysfunctional when power management is disabled. It also includes necessary error handling and cleanup code. Additionally, it has a Fixes tag and has been reviewed and signed-off by the relevant individuals.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an incorrect OOM (Out of Memory) return value and also improves error handling by making error paths return early for clarity. However, it does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not address any significant issues, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Microsoft Surface docks that use the Realtek RTL8152 chip. This patch adds the necessary USB device IDs for the Microsoft Surface 2 dock and Microsoft Surface 3 dock.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to zero padding of tx push data in the bnxt_en driver.

2. The patch correctly identifies that the arithmetic used for zero padding the last 64-bit word in the push buffer is incorrect.

3. The first change in the patch suggests using `pdata + length` to reach the end of the buffer correctly.

4. The second change in the patch suggests passing `end`, which is a `u64` pointer, to `PTR_ALIGN()` instead of `pdata`. This ensures that the aligned pointer minus one is the last 64-bit pointer to data.

5. The patch then assigns `end` as `pdata + length` and aligns it using `PTR_ALIGN()`, subtracting one to correctly pad the last 64-bit word.

6. Finally, the patch sets the value at `end` to zero, completing the zero padding.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific bug related to zero padding in the bnxt_en driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting arithmetic and pointer alignment. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the InfiniBand SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch Title: "IB/srp: Avoid sending a task management function needlessly"
   - The patch aims to prevent the unnecessary sending of a task management function in certain scenarios.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch checks if there is no RDMA/RC connection or if the QP (Queue Pair) is in an error state before sending a task management function.
   - If either condition is true, the function returns immediately without sending the task management function.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a check at the beginning of the `srp_send_tsk_mgmt` function to verify if the target is not connected or if the QP is in an error state. If either condition is true, the function returns -1.
   - The `srp_reset_device` function no longer checks for `target->qp_in_error` before returning `FAILED`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue by avoiding the unnecessary sending of a task management function when it is likely to fail due to the absence of an RDMA/RC connection or an error state in the QP. This fix does not appear to be trivial and could potentially prevent errors or hangs in the system.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing is recommended before final acceptance.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential deadlock issue in dm-bufio, which can occur with large block sizes.
2. The issue is caused by the allocation of kernel pagetables, which always use GFP_KERNEL, potentially leading to a deadlock.
3. The patch introduces the use of memalloc_noio_save and memalloc_noio_restore functions to set and restore the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag, respectively.
4. By setting the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag, all allocations in the process are done with the implied GFP_NOIO flag, preventing the deadlock from occurring.
5. The patch also mentions that the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag and memalloc_noio_save/memalloc_noio_restore functions are not available in stable kernels. Therefore, it suggests using the PF_MEMALLOC flag instead.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a warning message triggered by the stop_other_cpus() function during system reboot on specific hardware (24 CPU Westmere servers with 3.4-rc6 kernel).
2. The warning message indicates a potential issue with native_smp_send_reschedule() in arch/x86/kernel/smp.c.
3. The root cause of the warning is identified as the default_send_IPI_mask_allbutself_phys() function taking a significant amount of time to complete, allowing a timer interrupt to trigger load balancing on a stopped CPU.
4. The proposed solution is to disable local interrupts before calling stop_other_cpus() during the reboot process, preventing the timer interrupt from triggering load balancing.
5. The patch has been tested 25 times and confirmed to resolve the issue.
6. The patch is still necessary even with the slight behavior change in the latest 3.4 kernel.
7. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Don Zickus <dzickus@redhat.com>.

3. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by Filipe Manana and Chris Mason, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the patch.

4. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch modify the mapping flags for the free space inode. The original code was using a flags value that differed from the intended value. The patch corrects this by using the correct flags value.

5. Impact:
   The issue caused by the wrong mapping flags could render Btrfs unusable on ARM machines. This qualifies as a critical bug that affects functionality.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that impacts the usability of Btrfs on ARM machines.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may have default values due to incomplete initialization. In such cases, if a panel with a reasonable EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is available, the patch replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if the resolutions don't match. Systems without a valid internal panel EDID will still use the BIOS native mode.

The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_connectors.c`. It introduces a loop that iterates over the probed modes of the connector and checks if any mode has the `DRM_MODE_TYPE_PREFERRED` flag set. If a preferred mode is found and its resolution doesn't match the native mode, the native mode is replaced with the preferred mode.

The patch also includes a check to get native mode details from the EDID if necessary. If the native mode is still not set, it disables RMX (Reduced Blanking Mode) and sets the `rmx_type` to `RMX_OFF`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue where the BIOS native mode may have incorrect default values, and it provides a solution by using the panel's preferred mode if available. This patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential bug that could impact system functionality.

1. The patch aims to fix an issue related to the mangle zero checksum in skb_checksum_help() function in the net/core/dev.c file.

2. The patch explains that sending a zero checksum is acceptable for TCP but not for UDP. It mentions that UDPv6 should drop a frame with a 0 checksum by default, and UDPv4 might accept a corrupted packet without verifying the checksum.

3. To address this issue, the patch proposes replacing the zero checksum with 0xffff, regardless of the transport.

4. The patch mentions that the error was caught on SIT tunnels but seems to be generic.

5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and has acknowledgments from Maciej Żenczykowski.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue related to potential data corruption in UDP packets. The proposed fix of replacing the zero checksum with 0xffff is a suitable solution to ensure the integrity of UDP packets.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two regressions in the nouveau driver caused by changes in the move_notify function. The first regression is related to the incorrect handling of new_mem and bo->mem, which can lead to accessing stale memory nodes. The second regression involves passing TTM ghost objects to the driver, resulting in accessing uninitialized memory.

The patch reverts the change that caused the first regression and introduces a cleanup in the move() failure path. It also adds a workaround in the nouveau's move_notify() hook to handle the second regression.

Considering the nature of the regressions and the proposed fixes, it seems that this patch addresses real and critical issues that can potentially cause data corruption and access uninitialized memory. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the Linux kernel related to setting the sk_uid value in the ->setattr() function for socket files. The patch ensures that sk_uid is only set when the ATTR_UID flag is set in the ia_valid field of struct iattr, indicating that the uid is being changed.

The patch correctly saves the mc_size during the iteration and uses it to store the previously found microcode buffer.

This bug can cause critical issues such as oops and data corruption, which aligns with the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to recalculating the software remain-on-channel (ROC) work timeout in the mac80211 module.

2. The patch explains that the current code unnecessarily recalculates the ROC work timeout for hardware-related callers, which is pointless since they will skip the recalculation entirely.

3. The patch also mentions that the recalculation is necessary only when a new item is added to the list, as in the last remaining case, the recalculation had just been done.

4. The patch highlights a problem in the last case where if an item on the list expires during the recalculation, the list iteration outside becomes corrupted and crashes.

5. The patch fixes this issue by moving the recalculation to the only place where it is required.

6. The patch includes a signed-off-by line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to data corruption and improves the stability of the mac80211 module.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of GPIO interrupts on i.MX21 and i.MX27 devices when using device tree instantiation. The bug causes the handler to be unset, resulting in unusable GPIO interrupts.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: Yes, the bug causes unusable GPIO interrupts, which can impact the functionality of the affected devices.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, the bug can lead to a functional problem, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific bug.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can impact the functionality of the affected devices.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the mx2_camera driver in the Linux kernel. The patch removes the use of the MX2_CAMERA_SWAP16 and MX2_CAMERA_PACK_DIR_MSB flags and instead negotiates with the attached sensor to determine the mbus format and set the CSICR1 configuration accordingly.

The patch also includes changes to the mx27_emma_prp_table structure, adding a new entry with the V4L2_MBUS_FMT_UYVY8_2X8 format and setting the csicr1 field to CSICR1_SWAP16_EN.

In the mx2_camera_set_bus_param function, the patch removes the setting of the CSICR1_SWAP16_EN flag based on the platform_flags, as it is now handled by the negotiation with the sensor. 

Additionally, in the mx2_camera_get_formats function, the patch adds support for the V4L2_MBUS_FMT_UYVY8_2X8 format.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the mx2_camera driver and improves the negotiation of the mbus format, which can lead to better performance and compatibility with attached sensors.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two bugs related to resizing RAID0 arrays. The first bug is related to disabling the setting of available size on each device for RAID0 and Linear devices, as changing this can alter the effective layout of data. The second bug is related to ensuring that the reported size by raid0_size() is accurate by rounding device sizes to chunk sizes.

The patch also mentions that without this change, certain operations on a RAID0 array can cause a BUG. These bugs have been present for a long time, so the fix is suitable for any -stable kernel.

Considering the nature of the bugs being fixed and the potential for causing build errors, oops, or data corruption, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the "enospc_debug" mount option in the Btrfs file system. The patch adds additional debug information when the "enospc_debug" option is enabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds debug variable "debug" and assigns it the value of the "enospc_debug" mount option.
2. It checks if the block group for the given bytenr is found. If not found, it returns -1 and logs a warning if the "debug" variable is set.

While it may not directly cause critical issues, preventing erroneous status updates and potential data corruption is important for maintaining system stability and reliability.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "spi-topcliff-pch: Fix SSN Control issue" and it states that during processing 1 command/data series, the SSN (Slave Select Negation) signal should remain LOW, but currently, it becomes HIGH. The patch aims to fix this issue.

2. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating the authors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. In the code changes, a new constant `SSN_HIGH` is defined with a value of `0x03U`. This suggests that the SSN signal should be set to HIGH.

4. In the `pch_spi_set_ir` function, the code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is removed. This means that the control over SSN is no longer explicitly set to NO_CONTROL.

5. In the `pch_spi_start_transfer` function, the same code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is removed.

6. In the `pch_spi_process_messages` function, the code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is added before the main loop. This ensures that the SSN control is set to NO_CONTROL at the beginning of each message processing.

7. In the same `pch_spi_process_messages` function, after the main loop, the code that writes `SSN_HIGH` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is added. This sets the SSN signal to HIGH after all the messages have been processed.

Based on the analysis of the patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the SSN control in the spi-topcliff-pch driver. The changes ensure that the SSN signal is correctly controlled during the processing of command/data series. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue that could potentially cause data corruption or other problems.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to signal handling in the bit wait helpers. The bug was reported by Vladimir Murzin and bisected back to a specific commit. The commit inadvertently reversed the calls to schedule() and signal_pending(), causing an issue where the signal may be received while sleeping.

The patch correctly adjusts the order of the function calls to handle the case where a signal is received while sleeping. It checks for signal_pending() after the schedule() or io_schedule() calls and returns -EINTR if a signal is pending.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to hangs or incorrect behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of a spin lock in the AMD XGBE network driver. The patch correctly updates the spin lock initialization by using the proper pointer.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the XFS file system related to direct IO. The bug causes a mapping that spans EOF to not be marked as buffer-new(), resulting in the direct IO code not zeroing the tail of the block at the new EOF. This can lead to data corruption.

The patch addresses this issue by detecting a mapping that spans EOF and truncating it down to EOF. This ensures that the direct IO code behaves correctly for unaligned data blocks before EOF and correctly marks the mapping for blocks beyond EOF as buffer-new(). This fix has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where requests may be lost if a stopped queue restarts before the requests are added to the dispatch list. This issue could lead to data corruption or loss. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch addresses a potential data corruption issue, which qualifies as a critical bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a security issue. The patch addresses the issue of missing updates to the `msg_namelen` member in the `llc_ui_recvmsg()` function for both stream and datagram sockets. This omission could result in leaking uninitialized kernel stack memory to userland.

The patch sets `msg_namelen` to 0 early in the function, ensuring that it is updated later if the `msg_name` member needs to be filled. This fix prevents the leakage of kernel stack memory.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities and data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the cdc-acm driver. The patch adds a call to kfree() to free the memory allocated for the acm->country_codes variable in the error case when probe() fails.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical issue related to the transmission of network packets in the stmmac driver. The patch adds a missing spin_unlock call in the event of a DMA mapping error, ensuring that the tx_lock is released properly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch aims to prevent userspace from declaring a random kernel thread as the owner of a user space PI futex. The patch also includes a validation check for the thread group of private futexes.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to fallocate requests in the fuse filesystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch updates the inode size after a successful fallocate request. This ensures that the inode size reflects the correct value after the file has been extended. This fix addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or incorrect file size reporting. This is a valid fix for a critical bug.

2. The patch also invalidates the inode attributes after a successful fallocate request. This ensures that the latest attribute values, such as i_blocks, are picked up correctly. This fix addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect attribute values being used. This is a valid fix for a critical bug.

3. The patch includes a check for the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE flag. If this flag is not set, the patch calls the fuse_write_update_size() function to update the inode size. This is necessary to handle cases where the file has been extended. This is a valid fix for a critical bug.

4. The patch includes a check for the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag. If this flag is set, the patch calls the truncate_pagecache_range() function to remove the affected page cache range. This is necessary to handle cases where the file has holes punched. This is a valid fix for a critical bug.

5. The patch releases the inode's write lock and mutex if the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag is set. This ensures that the inode is properly unlocked in all cases. This is a valid fix for a critical bug.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to fallocate requests in the fuse filesystem. It addresses potential issues that could lead to data corruption, incorrect file size reporting, and incorrect attribute values. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug that can cause an endless loop. This bug was introduced by a previous patch that was intended to fix a soft lockup issue.
2. The original patch that introduced the bug has been reverted, but it is believed that the soft lockup problem has already been fixed by another patch.
3. The patch has been reported, tested, and reviewed by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone thorough testing and scrutiny.
4. The patch includes proper attribution to the individuals involved in tracking down the history of the issue.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to unregistering conflicting framebuffer drivers. The patch ensures that if the removal of a conflicting fb driver fails, the loading of the second driver is aborted to avoid potential kernel panics. 

The patch modifies the function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` to return an integer value indicating success or failure. It also updates the function `do_register_framebuffer` and `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` to handle the return value of `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and propagate the error code if necessary.

Considering the nature of the bug and the changes made in the patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that could lead to kernel panics and ensures proper handling of conflicting framebuffer drivers.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference issue when loading the cx88_dvb module for a Hauppauge HVR4000. The patch checks whether the module was actually loaded, which is a safer approach. The patch also mentions that the driver is buggy when it comes to unloading and reloading modules, which can cause crashes.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, it seems like this patch addresses a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to system instability or crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical issue: The patch fixes a situation where the system fails in mysterious ways due to the inability to find enough memory to instantiate RTAS (Runtime Abstraction Services) during a network install.

2. The issue can cause various failures: The patch mentions that SMT threads, storage, and network were all completely broken due to this issue. This indicates that the problem can lead to significant system instability and impact multiple areas of functionality.

3. The patch introduces a panic mechanism: Instead of allowing the system to continue running in a potentially unstable state, the patch adds a panic call if RTAS exists and memory allocation for it fails. This ensures that the system immediately halts and notifies the user about the critical issue.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch focuses on addressing a real and critical bug rather than making trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to prevent potential system failures and improve overall stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the renesas_usbhs driver. The issue is described as the controller not being able to complete the Control write status stage. The patch addresses this by avoiding the clearing of PID_BUF in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a specific issue related to the renesas_usbhs driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy(). The reason for the revert is that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy is called in atomic context, where scheduling is not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386.

The patch explains that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy, it is still better than using cond_resched() to cover only non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

The patch has been reported and tested by Larry Finger, and it has also been Acked by Michal Hocko. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, increasing its reliability.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to scheduling in atomic context on certain configurations. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, and it does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to fix an incorrect comparison in the powernow-k6 driver's powernow_k6_cpu_exit() function. The value of 'max_multiplier' is intended to be compared with clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself.

2. The patch also updates the for-loop condition to look for CPUFREQ_TABLE_END instead of hard-coding the loop count to 8. This change makes the code more flexible and avoids potential issues if the number of elements in the clock_ratio array changes in the future.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Viresh Kumar. This suggests that the bug is a real issue that needs to be addressed.

4. The patch is signed-off by Srivatsa S. Bhat and Acked-by Viresh Kumar, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug in the powernow-k6 driver and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rtc: handle errors correctly in rtc_irq_set_state()". This suggests that it aims to address an issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function.

2. The code checks the correctness of the parameters, but unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer. This means that regardless of the parameter values, the hrtimer is always armed or disarmed.

3. The consequence of this behavior is that a random task might arm/disarm the rtc timer, potentially surprising the real owner by either generating events or stopping them. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially impact the system's functionality.

4. The patch adds an error handling mechanism by introducing a check for errors. If an error is detected, the function immediately jumps to the "out" label, bypassing the arming/disarming of the hrtimer.

5. The patch also includes the necessary locking mechanism to ensure thread safety while accessing the rtc_task_lock.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue related to incorrect handling of errors in the rtc_irq_set_state() function, which can lead to unexpected behavior and impact system functionality. The patch introduces proper error handling and ensures thread safety, making it a valuable fix for a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a backport of changes made to the x86 pagefault handler for making it retryable and killable. The patch aims to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation on 64-bit sparc.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to address a specific issue related to the handling of page faults on sparc64 architecture. The addition of the "flags" variable with the FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY and FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE flags suggests that the patch enables the retry and killable behavior for page faults on sparc64.

The patch modifies the do_sparc64_fault function by introducing a "retry" label and a conditional jump to it. This allows for retrying the page fault if the VM_FAULT_RETRY flag is set. Additionally, the patch updates the flags passed to the handle_mm_fault function to include the FAULT_FLAG_WRITE flag if the fault is a write fault.

Overall, the patch seems to be addressing a specific issue related to page fault handling on sparc64 architecture and aligns it with the changes made for x86. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch qualifies as a real and critical bug fix.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) until more details about the bug or issue being fixed are provided.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the check on the PCI device type in vfio_pci_probe() function in the vfio-pci driver. The current code incorrectly uses the PCI_HEADER_TYPE value to mask the type value, instead of directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type.

The patch proposes to fix this issue by directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type for PCI_HEADER_TYPE_NORMAL. This change ensures that only normal PCI devices are supported by vfio-pci.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a specific functionality limitation in the vfio-pci driver.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c) in the drm/i915 driver.

2. The reason for the revert is that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

3. The original patch being reverted was considered nonsensical since the WARNING backtraces in the referenced bugzilla were about gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

4. The patch includes changes in the intel_lvds_get_config() function in intel_lvds.c and the intel_gmch_panel_fitting() function in intel_panel.c.

5. In intel_lvds_get_config(), the patch adds code to set the PANEL_8TO6_DITHER_ENABLE flag in the gmch_pfit.control field if the hardware is gen2/3.

6. In intel_gmch_panel_fitting(), the patch also sets the PANEL_8TO6_DITHER_ENABLE flag in the gmch_pfit.control field if the hardware is pre-965 and the pipe_bpp is 18.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a real issue related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware and pre-965 hardware with 18bpp panels. The lack of dithering has been reported by multiple users, indicating that it is a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to dithering on specific hardware configurations.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of level interrupts in the KVM virtualization subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. The patch ensures that the line level is always resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. This prevents the injection of spurious interrupts that have already been retired.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to the injection of spurious interrupts, which can cause system instability and incorrect behavior.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues. However, injecting spurious interrupts can lead to system instability and incorrect behavior, which can indirectly impact system security and reliability.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to interrupt handling.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can impact system stability and indirectly affect security.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes duplicate code in multiple drivers. The patch removes the unnecessary resource checks before calling `devm_ioremap_resource` in each driver. Since the resource checks are already performed by `devm_ioremap_resource`, there is no need to duplicate them in the driver code.

Considering that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and only removes trivial code, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error caused by a conflict with the identifier "ffs" in the code. The patch converts the "ffs" macro from an object-like macro to a function-like macro to avoid this conflict.

Since the build error is causing the code to fail to compile, this can be considered a real and critical bug. Therefore, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

However, it is important to note that this patch does not address any security issues, data corruption, oops, or hangs. It is solely focused on resolving a build error. Therefore, while the patch can be accepted in a stable release, it may not be considered a high-priority fix.

In conclusion, I would recommend accepting this patch in a stable release, but it should be prioritized accordingly based on the severity of other issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific behavior in the iwlwifi driver related to restarting the device. The patch checks if the device is being restarted and ignores requests from mac80211 to stop Tx aggregation while reconfiguring the device. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a specific behavior during device restart and does not fix any critical bugs or issues that fall under the mentioned criteria. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds locking using zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, preventing invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to invalid memory access. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch adds a new variable `mpn` of type `int` to store the value of the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit before it is cleared.

2. The `mpn` variable is assigned the value of `!test_and_clear_bit(EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM, &dev->flags)`. This means that `mpn` will be set to 1 if the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit is set in `dev->flags` and then cleared, and 0 otherwise.

3. The patch modifies the condition in the `if` statement that checks whether to call `info->manage_power(dev, 0)` or `usb_autopm_put_interface(dev->intf)` based on the value of `mpn`. Previously, the condition only checked if the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit was cleared, but now it also checks if `mpn` is true.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a potential issue where the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit is cleared before its value is checked. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the bit is cleared unexpectedly. The patch ensures that the value of the bit is read before it is cleared, and then uses the `mpn` variable to determine whether to call `info->manage_power(dev, 0)` or `usb_autopm_put_interface(dev->intf)`.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes incorrect antenna selection when Bluetooth (BT) is active, which can lead to disturbance and connectivity issues on certain devices.

2. The bug fix is necessary for devices with a single antenna: The patch specifically mentions that devices like the 3160 couldn't connect at all when BT was active. This indicates that the bug fix is critical for ensuring proper functionality on single antenna devices.

3. The patch includes a reference to a bug report: The patch references Bugzilla bug #97181, which provides additional context and evidence of the bug's impact.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a known issue. It also includes a "Signed-off-by" tag from the author, Emmanuel Grumbach, which suggests that the patch has undergone review and testing.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the antenna selection logic in the code.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a real and critical bug, has been reviewed and tested, and does not contain trivial changes. Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a list corruption issue in urb dequeue at host removal in the xhci driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential bug.

2. The patch description explains that the xhci driver frees data for all devices, both USB2 and USB3, the first time usb_remove_hcd() is called. However, when usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus, it tries to dequeue all pending urbs and touches td_list, which has already been freed for that endpoint. This indicates a potential issue with freeing data and accessing it later.

3. The patch includes Cc and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reported and tested by Joe Lawrence.

4. The patch includes Signed-off-by tags from Mathias Nyman and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the xhci_urb_dequeue() function in the xhci.c file. It adds a condition to the for loop to check if the xhci->devs[urb->dev->slot_id] is valid before continuing the loop. This change ensures that the loop does not access freed memory.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that can lead to list corruption and potential issues with freeing and accessing data. The patch has also been reviewed, tested, and approved by relevant individuals.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add status and return request handlers for the HID wiimote driver. The patch includes changes to handle status reports and return reports from the wiimote, as well as resetting the drm on every status report to maintain consistency.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   The patch does not explicitly mention fixing a bug. It seems to enhance the functionality of the HID wiimote driver by handling status and return reports more effectively. Without further information about any existing issues or bugs, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   The patch does not introduce any changes that would cause build errors, oopses, hangs, or data corruption.

3. Does the patch address a real security issue?
   The patch does not mention any security-related changes or fixes.

4. Does the patch fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Without additional context or information about any existing issues, it is challenging to determine if this patch addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces new functionality and handlers for status and return reports.

Based on the analysis, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Without more information about the specific bug or issue it addresses, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. Therefore, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch unless further details are provided.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a bug where sched_can_stop_tick() sometimes fails to re-enable the tick. This bug can lead to incorrect behavior in the scheduler, potentially causing performance issues or incorrect task scheduling.

2. The bug can cause a hang: The patch mentions that rq->cfs.nr_running can be 1 even though there are multiple runnable CFS tasks. This can lead to a situation where the scheduler incorrectly believes there is only one runnable task, potentially causing a hang.

3. The patch fixes a logic issue: The patch identifies a misplaced test in the sched_can_stop_tick() function. It suggests moving the fifo_nr_running test after the rr_nr_running tests to ensure correct behavior. This logic fix is necessary to address the bug.

4. The patch has been reported and tested by a reliable source: The patch has been reported and tested by Chris Metcalf, providing additional credibility to the bug and the proposed fix.

5. The patch has received appropriate review and sign-offs: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple individuals, including Peter Zijlstra (Intel) and Ingo Molnar. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and is considered suitable for inclusion.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to qeth (QDIO Ethernet) devices on the s390 architecture. The patch allows for the change of default values for blkt (block size) attributes in the sysfs interface.

The patch addresses a problem where blkt changes are reset during online setting due to a second invocation of qeth_determine_capabilities(). The proposed solution ensures that blkt default values are configured only during the first run of qeth_determine_capabilities(), allowing blkt changes to be kept during online setting.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a false-positive warning issue in the dev_pm_domain_set() function. The issue occurs when attempting to clear the pm_domain pointer after invoking the driver's ->remove() callback, leading to unnecessary warnings.

The patch addresses this by checking if the pointer passed to dev_pm_domain_set() is NULL and skipping the warning in that case.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a false-positive warning issue, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It modifies the dev_pm_domain_set() function to improve its behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is described as a hardening fix, addressing the issue of write-only access to other users' ttys. It mentions that such access is usually only given through setgid tty executables.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `tty_open` function and the `tiocsctty` function in the `tty_io.c` file.

   In the `tty_open` function:
   - It adds a check to prevent a process with write-only access to a tty from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal.
   - It checks if the file mode (`f_mode`) of the file pointer (`filp`) includes read access (`FMODE_READ`). If it does, the `__proc_set_tty` function is called to set the tty for the process.
   - It includes a comment mentioning the possibility of breaking old code that performs `open()` on a write-only file descriptor and suggests permitting it if `inode_permission(inode, MAY_READ) == 0`.

   In the `tiocsctty` function:
   - It adds a check similar to the one in `tty_open` to prevent a process with write-only access to a tty from setting it as the controlling terminal.
   - It checks if the file mode (`f_mode`) of the file pointer (`file`) does not include read access (`FMODE_READ`) and the process does not have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. If this condition is met, it returns `-EPERM` to indicate a permission error.

3. Analysis:
   The patch aims to prevent processes with write-only access to a tty from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. This is done to address potential security risks, as many distributions set the group of all ttys to "tty" and grant write-only access to all terminals for setgid tty binaries.

   The changes in the `tty_open` function ensure that only processes with read access to the tty can obtain the privileges associated with a controlling terminal. The additional check for `inode_permission(inode, MAY_READ) == 0` suggests a possible exception for old code that performs `open()` on a write-only file descriptor.

   The changes in the `tiocsctty` function prevent processes with write-only access to a tty from setting it as the controlling terminal, unless they have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address a real and critical security issue related to write-only access to ttys. It introduces necessary checks to prevent unauthorized processes from obtaining the privileges associated with a controlling terminal. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves managing the WM8731 ACTIVE bit as a supply widget.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak caused by dangling references to the request_queue in the s390/dasd driver. The patch removes the assignment of NULL to the gendisk's queue pointer before the put_disk call, ensuring that the gendisk_release function can properly release the reference and prevent memory loss.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing an issue that can cause data corruption and is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific condition related to the OMAP4 platform. The patch adds a check for valid clkctrl_offs and flags values before calling a low-level CM function. If the clkctrl_offs is zero and the HWMOD_OMAP4_ZERO_CLKCTRL_OFFSET flag is not set, the patch returns 0 without making the low-level CM call.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on the information provided, it is not clear if this patch addresses any of the mentioned critical issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or a specific condition fix rather than fixing a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless there is additional information indicating that it addresses a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to fixed-link PHY registration in the fs_enet driver. The patch ensures that any fixed-link PHY registered using of_phy_register_fixed_link() is properly deregistered and freed on probe errors and driver unbind.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. In the fs_enet_probe() function, if an error occurs while preparing and enabling the clock, the patch jumps to the label "out_deregister_fixed_link" instead of "out_free_fpi". This change ensures that the fixed-link PHY is deregistered before freeing the allocated memory.

2. The patch adds a new label "out_deregister_fixed_link" which checks if the current device node has a fixed-link PHY registered using of_phy_is_fixed_link(). If so, it calls of_phy_deregister_fixed_link() to deregister the fixed-link PHY.

3. In the fs_enet_remove() function, the patch adds a similar check and deregistration for the fixed-link PHY before freeing the network device.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug related to fixed-link PHY registration and ensures proper cleanup in case of errors or driver unbind.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the xfrm_state_construct() function of the xfrm_state.c file. The patch adds a kfree() call to free the memory allocated for the aead algorithm name.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to inappropriate zone congestion clearing in the vmscan module of the Linux kernel. The patch removes the clearing from the zone compaction section entirely and relies on the preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd to clear it if the zone is considered balanced.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a bug related to reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages. It ensures that zones only lose their congestion status when their watermarks have been restored. While the patch does not explicitly mention any of the mentioned critical issues, it does fix a specific issue related to zone congestion clearing, which can be considered a critical bug.

Regarding trivial fixes, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial changes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on removing the clearing from the zone compaction section.

Considering the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes. However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis and testing should be conducted by the Linux kernel maintainers before including it in the stable release.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to accessing registers in the gt power well from userspace in the Intel i915 driver. The patch checks if the hardware generation is less than 6 before allowing userspace forcewake references.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Without further information, it is difficult to assess the severity of the bug being fixed by this patch. If accessing registers in the gt power well from userspace is causing any of the mentioned critical issues, then this patch could be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

However, if this patch only addresses a non-critical issue or provides a minor improvement, it may not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.

Therefore, without additional context, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error that occurs when CONFIG_CPU_HAS_PMU is not selected. This can be considered a real and critical bug as it prevents the kernel from building properly on certain platforms. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to false interrupts triggering on UARTs A and B on Tegra chips. These false interrupts can lead to the UART IRQ being disabled and potentially cause issues such as the kernel printing "irq 68: nobody cared (try booting with the 'irqpoll' option)".

The patch enables the UART_BUG_NOMSR flag for UARTs A and B, which prevents the false interrupts from triggering by disabling UART_IER_MSI. This is a workaround to prevent the issue until a more refined algorithm can be implemented in the future.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues with UART interrupts and potentially impact system stability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content and purpose.

The patch is titled "drm/i915/fbdev: Stop repeating tile configuration on stagnation" and aims to address an issue related to tiled monitor configurations in the Intel i915 graphics driver. The patch fixes a bug where the driver would continue looping over unconfigured outputs even if no progress was being made in finding matching outputs for a tiled configuration.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, we can see that the variable "conn_seq" is introduced to keep track of the previously configured connectors. If the current configuration matches the previous one, the loop over unconfigured outputs is stopped, preventing unnecessary iterations.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to tiled monitor configurations and improves the efficiency of the configuration process. However, it does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix rather than a critical bug fix. As per the given criteria, patches containing trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to sharing PCI IRQs with ISA IRQs. The issue can cause an interrupt storm due to incompatible pin attributes, which can lead to system instability. The patch includes changes in the drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c, drivers/acpi/pci_link.c, and include/linux/acpi.h files.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential system instability problem and improves the compatibility of PCI and ISA IRQs.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a buffer overflow issue when reading the sysfs file of 'pending'. It explains that there can be a large number of pending requests, causing the buffer of PAGE_SIZE to be insufficient. This issue is particularly prevalent in scsi-mq, where the queue depth of scsi_host and blk-mq is large, but scsi_device's queue_depth is small.

The patch fixes a warning message and related memory destruction that occurs due to this buffer overflow issue. It modifies the sysfs_list_show function to handle the case where the output may be truncated. If the output buffer is not large enough to hold all the pending requests, it adds a truncation indicator ('...') to indicate that some requests are not shown.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a buffer overflow and memory corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the re-queueing of requests in the dm (device mapper) subsystem. The patch addresses an issue where requeued requests could potentially stay in the queue indefinitely if there are no other I/O activities to the device.

The patch includes a fix by adding the "blk_run_queue_async(q)" function call after requeuing the request. This function call ensures that the queue is kicked and the requeued request is processed even if there are no other pending I/O activities.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that could lead to requests being stuck in the queue indefinitely, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a memory leak issue in the ssu100 USB serial driver.
2. The fix involves replacing the attach and release functions with port_probe and port_remove functions.
3. The release function (ssu100_release) is removed from the code.
4. The attach function (ssu100_attach) is modified to call ssu100_initdevice.
5. Two new functions, ssu100_port_probe and ssu100_port_remove, are added.
6. The ssu100_port_probe function initializes the port private data and sets it using usb_set_serial_port_data.
7. The ssu100_port_remove function retrieves the port private data and frees it using kfree.
8. The patch also updates the usb_serial_driver structure to use the new port_probe and port_remove functions instead of the release function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert a previous commit that added a USB quirk for a MicroTouch Systems touchscreen. The reason for the reversion is that the issue was only observed on prototypes and is not seen on younger units.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it seems to remove a quirk that was added for a specific touchscreen device.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a typo in the code that could potentially lead to walking random data. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

The patch modifies the file "virt/kvm/eventfd.c" in the Linux kernel. It changes the variable name used in the list_for_each_entry loop from "list" to "link". This change ensures that the loop iterates correctly over the resampler_list.

From the provided information, it is not clear whether this typo causes any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. It seems to be more of a code quality improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug.

Therefore, based on the given criteria, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a real and critical issue. As a result, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a circular dependency issue in the libata transport code. The patch removes the unnecessary reference to the parent device in the ata port, link, and device objects, and updates the release functions accordingly.

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a circular dependency issue, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does not seem to have a significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug and does not address any real and significant issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix the calculation of transmitted bytes on tx complete in the c_can driver. It addresses an issue where the number of bytes transmitted was not updated correctly when multiple CAN messages with different lengths were transmitted together. This resulted in incorrect transmit byte counts being displayed by programs like 'ifconfig'.

2. Impact:
   The issue addressed by the patch does not cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does fix an incorrect calculation that affects the accuracy of transmit byte counts displayed by certain programs.

3. Patch Analysis:
   The patch modifies the c_can_do_tx() function in the c_can.c file. It adds a call to the c_can_object_get() function before updating the tx_bytes statistic. This ensures that the correct message object is active when reading the DLC (Data Length Code) value.

4. Patch Evaluation:
   Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to transmit byte count calculation in the c_can driver. While it may not be considered critical or a security issue, it addresses an incorrect behavior that affects the accuracy of transmit byte counts. Therefore, it can be considered a valid fix.

Considering the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although it does not fix a critical bug or a security issue, it addresses an incorrect behavior that can impact the accuracy of transmit byte counts, which is a valid concern for certain applications.
true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue where the old inode cache is used even when the file type is different. This can cause problems such as being unable to change directories or read symbolic links.

2. The bug is reproducible and has been reported in the bugzilla.kernel.org bug tracker (Bug ID: 90011).

3. The patch modifies the `cifs_prime_dcache` function in the `fs/cifs/readdir.c` file.

4. The patch checks if the file type (mode) has changed along with the unique ID (inode number) before updating the inode in place. If either the unique ID or the file type has changed, the patch drops the old inode cache and recreates it.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can cause functional problems and provides a fix that ensures the correct behavior when the file type is different. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Jeff Layton and Signed-off-by Nakajima Akira and Steve French, which adds credibility to its validity.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing is always recommended before applying any patch.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug that causes an Oops. The bug is described in the Bugzilla link provided. The patch modifies the `cx_auto_free` function in `patch_conexant.c` to properly detach the beep input device and free the codec. This prevents the leak and potential Oops.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to dumping native eBPF programs attached to sockets in the sock_diag_put_filterinfo() function. The patch addresses the problem where orig_prog is always NULL for native eBPF programs, causing a panic when trying to access its filter length or copy the filter instructions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: Yes, the bug causes a panic when trying to access NULL orig_prog, which can lead to system instability or crashes. So, it meets this criterion.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: Yes, the bug can cause a panic, which falls under the "oh, that's not good" issue category. Therefore, it meets this criterion.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch addresses a specific issue related to native eBPF programs and their dumping process. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. So, it meets this criterion.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an initialization failure on non-exynos3250 SoCs in the rtc-s3c driver. The patch adds a conditional check to determine if the rtc source clock is needed before attempting to initialize it. If the clock is not needed, the initialization failure is avoided.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to initialization failure on certain SoCs.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical bug or a significant issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to checking the return value of `blk_mq_init_queue` in multiple drivers (`null_blk.c`, `nvme-core.c`, and `virtio_blk.c`). The patch replaces the check `if (!nullb->q)` with `if (IS_ERR(nullb->q))` in `null_blk.c`, `if (!dev->admin_q)` with `if (IS_ERR(dev->admin_q))` in `nvme-core.c`, and `if (!q)` with `if (IS_ERR(q))` in `virtio_blk.c`.

The change from `!nullb->q` to `IS_ERR(nullb->q)` in `null_blk.c` and similar changes in other drivers suggest that the patch is addressing a potential error condition where `blk_mq_init_queue` may return an error pointer instead of `NULL`. By using `IS_ERR` instead of a direct check for `NULL`, the patch ensures that any error pointer returned by `blk_mq_init_queue` is properly handled.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to build errors or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to concurrent access to the VMA prio list in the NOMMU subsystem. The patch adds mutex locking and unlocking around the relevant code sections to prevent concurrent access issues.

Considering these factors, I believe that accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases would be appropriate to address the critical bug and prevent system lockup.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the setup of the irq trigger configuration in the at86rf230 driver. The commit message explains that the previous assumption of the interrupt trigger being properly configured cannot be safely made, as some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot.

The patch addresses this issue by forcing the irq to trigger on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. It checks the current irq trigger type and if it is not set, it sets it to IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues with interrupt handling on certain boards. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the intel_pstate driver related to the global P-state limits being unnecessarily changed when calling intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(). This behavior can be confusing and goes against user expectations.

The patch resolves this issue by removing the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(). This change ensures that the global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor in passive mode, aligning with user expectations.

The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits already allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. Therefore, the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account in that case, as expected.

The patch also reduces the code size by removing a few lines of code.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific bug and improves the behavior of the intel_pstate driver without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect access of enum controls in the wm8994 codec driver. The patch changes the access method from `value.integer.value[]` to `value.enumerated.item[]` for the DRC Mode and EQ Mode enum controls.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: Yes, it addresses the incorrect access of enum controls, which can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

2. The bug is critical: It is not explicitly mentioned whether the bug is critical or not. We need to assess the impact of the bug to determine its criticality.

3. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: The patch does not mention any of these specific issues. We need to evaluate the impact of the bug to determine if it falls into one of these categories.

4. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to be a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to enum control access.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the criticality and impact of the bug being fixed by this patch. Without further information, it is not possible to definitively decide whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic issue in the netxen_nic_poll() function. The patch ensures that the poller returns the budget value when it wants to be called again, even if the driver limits TX completion. 

The patch also includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, tested, and reviewed the fix. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a logic issue that may not fall under the "oh, that's not good" category. 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a synchronization issue in the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in MCG paravirtualization. The cleanup is triggered by a client re-register event to protect against misbehaved guests causing corruption in the join/leave database. However, the cleanup operation is heavy and is performed in a work queue for further processing.

The problem arises when the cleanup is delayed, and the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) leaves and re-joins groups before the cleanup occurs. In such cases, when the cleanup eventually takes place, it prunes the newly-joined MCGs, leaving the ULP without the actual MCGs while believing it has joined them.

The patch fixes this issue by setting a flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clearing it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup operation is synchronized with the ULP's group joining and leaving actions.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone thorough scrutiny. It also modifies the code in a targeted manner, addressing the specific synchronization problem without introducing any trivial changes.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the potential for data corruption, it is important to include this patch in the Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and security of the system.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a quirk to avoid setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE on certain machines, specifically Dell XPS 13 models. This is done because these machines suffer from non-functional backlight controls if BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE is set.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the i915 driver to apply the quirk. It adds a new quirk flag QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE and a corresponding function quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable() to set the flag.

3. The patch also updates the intel_quirks[] array in intel_display.c to include the Dell XPS13 models and the quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable() function.

4. Finally, the patch modifies the intel_panel_enable_backlight() function in intel_panel.c to check for the QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE flag before setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue with backlight controls on Dell XPS 13 models. It introduces a quirk to avoid setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE on these machines, which resolves the non-functional backlight controls problem.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that affects a specific hardware model, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a warning related to type casting in the NVMe driver on 32-bit machines. The warning itself is harmless and does not indicate any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Since the patch does not address any significant issue and is only aimed at silencing a warning, it can be considered a trivial fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition between incoming traffic and initialization flow in the mlx4_en driver for Mellanox ConnectX 10GbE NIC. This race condition can cause receive queues to become full and prevent new interrupts about completions. The patch schedules NAPI once the port_up flag is set, allowing the processing of all completions and releasing them.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and potential hangs, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a duplicate call to ieee80211_register_hw() in the rtlwifi driver for the rtl8192se chipset. The duplicate call is present in the callback routine for deferred firmware loading. 

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to address a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the driver. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

1. The patch removes the need for the `shark_led_work` function to take the v4l2 lock.
2. The code that acquires and releases the lock is removed from the `shark_led_work` function.
3. The `cancel_work_sync` function is called to cancel the `shark_led_work` work queue before unregistering the LED devices and releasing the v4l2 device.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing unnecessary code related to acquiring and releasing the v4l2 lock in the `shark_led_work` function. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It appears to be a trivial cleanup rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition that can lead to incorrect marking of blocks as clean or dirty in the dm cache. This issue can result in data corruption and incorrect behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the virtio-scsi LUN structure. The patch checks if byte 0 of the LUN structure is set to '1', as required by the virtio spec. If it is not set to '1', the patch sends a bad target response.

However, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on the specific issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, the change is related to the dma-debug functionality in the Linux kernel. The patch switches the check in the `check_for_illegal_area` function from using `_text` to using `_stext` as the starting address for overlap checks.

The rationale behind this change is that `_text` is not guaranteed to be consistent across architectures, and using it may lead to false positives or false negatives in detecting illegal memory mappings. By switching to `_stext`, which is guaranteed to contain text sections, the patch aims to improve the accuracy of the check.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue with the accuracy of the `check_for_illegal_area` function.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls into the category of a code cleanup or improvement rather than fixing a critical bug. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical issue: The patch ensures that the chip is ready before any access to it. This is important because on the Snowball platform, an external regulator needs to be enabled before the chip comes online. Waiting for the chip to be ready avoids potential issues that may arise from accessing the chip before it is fully operational.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve adding a wait loop to check the READY bit in PMT_CTRL and aborting if the device is not ready within 100ms. This is a significant modification to the code logic.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new bugs or regressions. The patch adds a necessary wait loop to ensure proper chip initialization.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Robert Marklund, Linus Walleij, and David S. Miller. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases as it addresses a real and critical issue without introducing any trivial fixes or new issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to capacity calculation in the SCSI driver for disks with a 32-bit sector_t. The patch introduces a new function `sd_addressable_capacity` to ensure that the reported capacity can be expressed in terms of sector_t without overflowing.

The patch also includes a check in the `read_capacity_16` and `read_capacity_10` functions to verify if the reported capacity exceeds the limit supported by the kernel. If the capacity is too large, an error message is printed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to capacity calculation, which is an important aspect for disk operations.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? No, the bug does not seem to cause any of these issues directly.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch introduces a new function and modifies existing code to address the bug.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While the bug fix is valid, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases as it does not address a critical issue or introduce any significant improvements.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to support tunneling with upper devices in the mlx5e driver. It addresses a specific use-case where the uplink device is stacked under upper devices such as a bridge or OVS internal port.

2. The patch fixes an issue related to the egress mirred device not representing a port on the HW e-switch to which the ingress device belongs.

3. The patch introduces changes to the `mlx5e_route_lookup_ipv4` function in the `en_tc.c` file.

4. It adds a new variable `esw` of type `struct mlx5_eswitch` to store the mlx5 eswitch information.

5. The patch modifies the logic for determining the egress device. If the egress device is not on the same HW e-switch, the uplink device is used instead. Otherwise, the egress device remains the same.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific use-case and fixes an issue related to the egress mirred device. The changes appear to be relevant and necessary for proper tunneling support with upper devices in the mlx5e driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to fix a warning triggered by the -Wstringop-overflow flag introduced in GCC 7. This warning detects buffer overflows in calls to string handling functions. The warning is triggered during the compilation of the mem_init() function in arch/sparc/include/setup.h due to the declaration of "empty_zero_page".

The patch aligns the declaration of "empty_zero_page" in arch/sparc/include/setup.h to that of other architectures. It changes the declaration from "extern unsigned long empty_zero_page;" to "extern unsigned long empty_zero_page[PAGE_SIZE / sizeof(unsigned long)];". Similarly, it modifies the usage of "empty_zero_page" in ZERO_PAGE macro in the same file.

Additionally, the patch also modifies the declaration of "empty_zero_page" in arch/sparc/include/asm/setup.h to match the new declaration in arch/sparc/include/setup.h.

Finally, the patch updates the usage of memset() in arch/sparc/mm/init_32.c to cast "empty_zero_page" to void* instead of "&empty_zero_page".

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a warning introduced by a specific compiler flag.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to kdump failure when triggered with pending IO. The patch modifies the functions `k2_sata_softreset` and `k2_sata_hardreset` in the `sata_svw.c` file.

The patch checks the DMA start bit before performing a reset and clears the start bit if it is set. This ensures that the PIO command is successful and allows kdump to succeed.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical issue that can cause kdump failure, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch modifies the `wm8994_gpio_direction_out` function in the `gpio-wm8994.c` file.
2. It adds a check for the `value` parameter and sets it to `WM8994_GPN_LVL` if it is non-zero.
3. The `wm8994_set_bits` function is then called with the updated `value` parameter, combining `WM8994_GPN_DIR` and `WM8994_GPN_LVL` flags.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue where the hardware is not set up correctly when enabling the GPIO pin as an output. By not paying attention to the value being set, the hardware may not reflect the requested configuration, leading to unexpected results for the caller.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential issue that could result in incorrect behavior, it can be categorized as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Considering the patch addresses a real bug that can cause issues such as data corruption or system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The bug is not trivial, and the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to data exposure after a crash in the ext4 filesystem. The bug occurs when delayed allocation is used, and the inode is not added to the transaction's list of inodes needing flushing before commit. This can result in stale block contents being visible after the transaction is committed.

The patch introduces a fix by adding the inode to the transaction's ordered inode list whenever freshly allocated blocks are attached to the inode using a written extent. This ensures that block contents are properly written before committing the transaction, preventing data exposure issues.

Additionally, the patch mentions that it also handles other cases where stale data exposure was possible, such as filling holes via mmap in data=ordered,nodelalloc mode.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can lead to data corruption and provides a necessary fix to ensure data integrity in the ext4 filesystem.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to handling interlaced bit for sdvo dtd conversion in the drm/i915 driver. The patch also adds proper names for certain magic numbers and comments to indicate their correspondence with EDID detailed timings.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the vti6 interface registration in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description states that the vti6 interface is registered before the rtnl_link_ops block is attached, resulting in the RTM_NEWLINK message missing IFLA_INFO_KIND. This indicates a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or missing information.

2. The patch reorders the attachment of the rtnl_link_ops block to fix the issue. By moving the assignment of dev->rtnl_link_ops before the register_netdevice() call, the RTM_NEWLINK message should now include IFLA_INFO_KIND.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that could result in missing information in the RTM_NEWLINK message, which can be considered a critical issue.

The patch includes a fix by incrementing the key for the beginning of the range, ensuring that all entries are properly removed. 

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a critical bug related to a hang issue in the iscsi-target module. The bug occurs when percpu_ida_alloc() is starved for tags, causing a connection reset to hang indefinitely. The patch modifies percpu_ida_alloc() to check for signal_pending_state() and make interruptible sleep optional. Additionally, it converts iscsit_allocate_cmd() to set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE for GFP_KERNEL or TASK_RUNNING for GFP_ATOMIC.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can cause a hang, which is a significant problem. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving the underlying bug. Therefore, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific regression caused by commit 520bd7a8b415 in the mmc block driver. The regression affects platforms that rely on fixed mmcblk device indexes, which are now changing due to the mentioned commit.

The patch proposes to restore the behavior of how mmcblk device indexes are picked by using the same index for the mmcblk device as for the corresponding mmc host device. This change is expected to meet the expectations of platforms suffering from the regression.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it fixes a regression caused by a previous commit, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that affects certain platforms and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression issue related to card detection for the sdhci-esdhc-imx driver on dt platforms. The regression was introduced by commit 8d86e4fcccf6, which caused the SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION quirk to be incorrectly set for all dt platforms, resulting in the use of MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL instead of the valid GPIO card detect.

The patch adds back the missing function and follows the original approach to clear the quirk if a valid CD GPIO is found for dt platforms.

Considering the patch addresses a regression issue that affects card detection, it can be classified as a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Instead, it addresses a specific scenario related to the order of driver probing.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real and critical issue related to the Avago MGA-81563 RF amplifier. The patch adds a module parameter called 'enable_rf_gain_ctrl' which allows enabling RF gain control. By default, without the module parameter, the RF gain control is set to a 'grabbed' state, preventing the setting of the value to the control.

The patch also includes the necessary changes to initialize and setup the control handlers for both the receiver and transmitter. Additionally, it includes the use of the 'v4l2_ctrl_grab' function to grab or release the control based on the value of 'hackrf_enable_rf_gain_ctrl'.

Considering the potential risk of destroying the RF amplifier with too strong a signal or transmitting to a bad antenna, and the fact that the patch introduces a module parameter to enable RF gain control, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue related to potential hardware damage and provides a configurable option to mitigate the risk.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a kernel oops when inserting an element into a verdict map in nf_tables. The bug is triggered by a missing initialization of the `net` pointer in the `bind_ctx` structure. This missing initialization can lead to a kernel crash when dereferencing the `net` pointer.

Given that the bug causes a kernel crash, it qualifies as a real and critical issue. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to ensure the stability and security of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses an issue where the VMWRITEs to enable PML (Page Modification Logging) could target the wrong VMCS or no VMCS at all if the vCPU thread is migrated to another CPU between loading the new VMCS and enabling PML. This can result in vmwrite errors and potential instability.

The patch ensures that the VMCS remains current while enabling PML by performing the VMWRITEs while the CPU is pinned. Additionally, the allocation of the PML buffer is moved out of the critical section.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can potentially cause data corruption or instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the handling of multiple RMRRs (Reserved Memory Region Reporting) for the same PCI device. This bug causes DMA (Direct Memory Access) failures on certain HP platforms.

6. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, but rather a substantial modification to handle multiple RMRRs correctly.

Considering all these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and prevent DMA failures on affected HP platforms. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption. The bug occurs when opening a file by fhandle with a cold dcache, then unlinking and closing it. In this case, two dentries are created - one disconnected and one regular. The regular dentry will have its reference to the inode dropped correctly, but the disconnected dentry will not. This leads to the final iput() being delayed indefinitely.

The patch modifies the dput() function in fs/dcache.c to check for the DCACHE_DISCONNECTED flag and handle it appropriately. It adds a new condition to skip the iput() if the dentry is disconnected.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to reporting overrun errors in the keyspan USB driver. The patch inserts a null character and reports the overrun error only once, instead of reporting it for each byte.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where an unheld mutex is unlocked if a sanity check fails in the `scu_command()` function. The patch adds a `printk()` statement to log the error and returns the `status` value instead of going to the `error` label.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a potential issue that is not expected to occur in reality.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to "of_irq_parse_pci() failed with rc=-19" error messages. These messages are considered annoying and can be misleading.

2. The patch moves the printing code into the "of_irq_parse_pci()" function, ensuring that the error message is only emitted when the cause of the failure is not due to PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN being zero.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior. It only improves the error reporting mechanism.

5. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to error messages and does not introduce any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an assertion for marking AoE packets as requiring no checksum. This does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any significant functionality or performance improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is a workaround for a bug in an old version of GCC (GCC-3.4.6) and involves replacing an unused variable with a constant value. It does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a build error when CONFIG_OF is disabled. The patch nullifies the table pointer in the of_match_device() function when CONFIG_OF=n, which allows the driver to compile successfully.

Since this patch only addresses a build error and does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to double-free of the AUX buffer in the perf subsystem. The bug occurs when rb->aux_refcount is decremented to zero before rb->refcount, resulting in a double free of rb->aux_pages. The patch adds a check in __rb_free_aux() to prevent this double-free issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced in commit 861d2107, which caused a crash when a different mutex was used to protect the same list. The patch updates the nvc0_fb_vram_new function in the nvc0.c file to use the correct mutex (pfb->base.mutex) instead of the incorrect one (mm->mutex).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a crash. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver recovery in the NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) subsystem. The patch initializes the device list head before starting, which is necessary for proper driver recovery.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses an issue that is crucial for driver recovery in the NVMe subsystem.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a critical bug without introducing any new issues or trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch author mentions that the current implementation doesn't cause any problems, but it will confuse upcoming TLB flush changes. However, the author also states that there won't be any meaningful performance impact because the affected function is only used when offlining a CPU.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug, but rather addresses a potential confusion in future changes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my analysis is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch and analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

1. The patch addresses a discrepancy in behavior between O_CREAT and O_TMPFILE flags in the open() system call. It aligns the behavior of O_TMPFILE with O_CREAT, making it consistent and predictable.

2. The patch fixes a bug where the 'mode' argument is ignored when O_TMPFILE is used with openat(). This bug can lead to incorrect permissions being applied to the newly created file, resulting in potential security issues.

3. The patch includes a reference to a related glibc bug that highlights the discrepancy in behavior between O_CREAT and O_TMPFILE flags. This adds credibility to the need for the patch.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Andy Lutomirski, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Rannaud and Linus Torvalds, further validating its importance and correctness.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to file creation and permissions, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "mfd: Fix ACPI conflict check" and it aims to fix a bug in the code that checks for ACPI conflicts. The current implementation only checks the first resource of every device, which has been broken since February 2010. The patch proposes to fix the check to run on each resource individually, once.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `mfd_add_device` function in the `mfd-core.c` file. Specifically, it changes the line:
   ```
   ret = acpi_check_resource_conflict(res);
   ```
   to:
   ```
   ret = acpi_check_resource_conflict(&res[r]);
   ```

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a bug in the code that checks for ACPI conflicts. The current implementation is flawed as it only checks the first resource of every device, which has been broken for a long time. The proposed fix modifies the code to check each resource individually, once.

   This bug fix does not fall under the category of a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that has been broken for a significant period of time, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although it does not fix a critical bug or a security issue, it addresses a long-standing issue in the code and improves the overall functionality and reliability of the system.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the decoding of FS_LOCATIONS attribute in NFSv4. The bug causes ls command to fail with "Input/output error" when accessing certain directories. The patch addresses this issue by cleaning up the FATTR4_WORD0_FS_LOCATIONS bits after decoding success.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that causes data corruption (ls command output is corrupted). It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The issue is that the variables `record_size`, `console_size`, and `ftrace_size` can be set to 0 to disable the corresponding feature. However, calling `rounddown_pow_of_two(0)` is undefined behavior.

2. The patch fixes the bug: The patch introduces a condition `!is_power_of_2()` to check if the value is a power of 2 before calling `rounddown_pow_of_two()`. This ensures that the function is not called with 0 as an argument, avoiding the undefined behavior.

3. The bug has been present since commit 1894a253: This information suggests that the bug has been present for a while, and it is important to fix it to prevent any potential issues caused by the undefined behavior.

4. The patch is well-reviewed: The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Kees Cook, which indicates that it has undergone a thorough review process.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a real bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause a kernel crash due to an uninitialized spinlock. The crash occurs when the UEFI page tables are not owned by init_mm and are not covered by fully constructed struct pages.

The patch adds an unconditional call to pgtable_page_ctor() in the late_alloc() function, which ensures that the per-page spinlock is properly initialized. This fix addresses the issue and prevents the kernel crash.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to changing the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) when using per-cpu processing in the mvneta driver. The issue causes blocking of all port's interrupts and prevents transmitting data after the MTU change under heavy load.

The patch addresses the problem by disabling percpu interrupts temporarily during the reconfiguration of TXQs and RXQs. It introduces two new functions, `mvneta_percpu_enable` and `mvneta_percpu_disable`, which enable and disable percpu interrupts respectively.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that can cause a hang or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, for accessing the resource tree.
   - This indicates that there will be run-time modifications to the resource tree, which can happen on multiple threads.

2. The `vmbus_allocate_mmio` function is modified to acquire and release the `hyperv_mmio_lock` semaphore.
   - The semaphore is acquired before the resource tree is accessed and released after the resource allocation is attempted.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing necessary locking mechanisms to handle run-time modifications to the resource tree. This suggests that there might be potential concurrency issues without the locking mechanism.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential concurrency issue, it can be categorized as fixing a "real and critical bug" that could lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression in the implementation of drm_vblank_on in Linux 3.18+. The patch aims to address a situation where a kms driver could override the user's choice to always re-enable vblank irqs when the user specified a value of zero. The patch ensures that vblanks are only re-enabled if there are clients left or if the user requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a regression and improves the behavior of drm_vblank_on.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to audio playback on Kirkwood / OpenRD client, where the machine hw_params failed with an unknown error code (-524). This indicates a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the system.

2. The patch is fixing a regression introduced by commit e22579713ae1, which added the sysclk / SND_SOC_CLOCK_OUT setting. The intention was to ignore ENOTSUPP, but the current implementation fails if the operation is not supported. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific problem caused by a recent change.

3. The patch has been reviewed by Andrew Lunn and signed-off by Aaro Koskinen and Mark Brown, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review and testing.

4. The patch itself is relatively small and focused, making it less likely to introduce new issues or regressions.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in the Linux -stable releases to address the audio playback issue on Kirkwood / OpenRD client.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the KR2 work-around detection of BCM8073 devices in the bnx2x driver. The patch modifies the condition for detecting non-KR2 devices by correcting the comparison value from 0x2 to 0x20.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug being fixed. However, since the patch addresses a specific issue related to the detection of non-KR2 devices, it is likely not a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues.

Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the information available, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further analysis and information about the severity of the bug being fixed would be necessary to make a more accurate determination.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to ACPI SLIT table parsing in the arch/x86/mm/srat.c file. The issue is that when the ACPI SLIT table has an I/O locality, the numa_set_distance() function emits a warning message about node IDs being out of bounds. This warning message can cause confusion, even though I/O localities are not supported and are ignored.

The patch modifies the acpi_numa_slit_init() function to avoid calling numa_set_distance() with NUMA_NO_NODE, which is the value returned for I/O localities. It adds a check to skip I/O localities when iterating over the locality_count.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to ACPI SLIT table parsing and eliminates unnecessary warning messages that can cause confusion.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a warning in the `alloc_huge_page` function in `mm/hugetlb.c`. The warning states that the variable `page` may be used uninitialized in this function.

2. The patch initializes the `page` variable explicitly to `NULL` to avoid potential kernel oops in a corner case where the nodemask from vma policy does not intersect with the nodemask from cpuset.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a warning that could potentially lead to a kernel oops in a specific corner case. Although it may not address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is removing an unused define called "cpuidle_coupled_lock" in the cpuidle/coupled.c file. The patch was prompted by a compilation warning that occurred when using the -RT patch, but it is stated that the fix should apply to non-RT as well.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a trivial fix related to an unused variable, which falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc" that are not accepted in -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses the issue of device name collisions between 7-bit and 10-bit addresses in the I2C protocol. It adds an arbitrary offset to 10-bit addresses to prevent collisions. The offset is chosen to ensure the address remains recognizable.

The patch also includes a warning about the experimental nature of 10-bit address support and the lack of proper handling and support in the code. It mentions that no 10-bit address devices have been seen yet.

In terms of the impact, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It addresses a potential issue of device name collisions, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue but not critical.

Additionally, the patch includes some documentation updates and a minor code change in the `i2c_new_device` function to add the offset for 10-bit clients.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug and includes non-trivial changes such as documentation updates and code modifications.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the ONDA MT825UP product ID from the driver in the usb/serial/option.c file. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be removing support for a specific device that had a firmware update to fix a CDC descriptor issue.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and is more of a device-specific update, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new macro called `div64_long` in the `include/linux/math64.h` header file. This macro is used to divide a 64-bit number by a long, which can be 4 bytes on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes on 64-bit systems.

The patch also includes a suggested-by tag from Thomas Gleixner and is signed-off by Sasha Levin and Thomas Gleixner. It is worth noting that the patch does not fix a specific bug or address any critical issues mentioned in the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it introduces a new macro without addressing any specific issues, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for handling encapsulation offloads when computing segment lengths in the net core of the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch checks if the `encapsulation` flag is set in the `skb` structure. If it is set, it calculates the length of the inner network headers by subtracting the transport header pointer from the inner transport header pointer.
2. If the `gso_type` field in `shinfo` indicates TCPv4 or TCPv6 segmentation offload, it adds the length of the inner TCP header to the calculated length.
3. If the `encapsulation` flag is not set and the `gso_type` field indicates TCPv4 or TCPv6 segmentation offload, it calculates the length of the TCP header.
4. Finally, it returns the calculated length plus the `gso_size` field from `shinfo`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific scenario where the encapsulation offload is enabled and correctly calculates the segment length by considering the inner network headers. It also handles the case where the encapsulation offload is not enabled and calculates the segment length based on the TCP header.

Considering that this patch fixes a specific issue related to encapsulation offloads and does not contain any trivial changes, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a warning generated by gcc 4.1.2 in the f81534_port_probe() function of the f81534.c file.

2. The warning indicates that the comparison in the code is always false due to the limited range of the data type.

3. The patch fixes this issue by introducing an intermediate variable of type int (ret) to store the return value of the f81534_logic_to_phy_port() function.

4. Instead of assigning the return value directly to the u8 f81534_port_private.phy_num, the patch assigns it to the ret variable.

5. The patch also removes the unnecessary check for F81534_NUM_PORT, as the callee always returns a valid port number in case of success.

6. By forwarding the actual error code instead of converting it to -ENODEV, the patch ensures that any negative error value returned by f81534_logic_to_phy_port() is properly handled.

7. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

8. The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes an issue where the IPv4 addresses on an IPv6 listening socket were being mangled, resulting in incorrect addresses being returned to user space clients.

2. The bug can cause incorrect behavior: Prior to the patch, user space clients opening an IPv6 SCTP socket and receiving IPv4 connections would see a sockaddr with AF_INET6, but the address would be wrong. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially impact the functionality of affected applications.

3. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch reorders the code to guarantee correct behavior regardless of the union layout. It correctly maps the v4 address to a v4-mapped v6 address, ensuring that the correct address is returned to user space clients.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged: It has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Jason Gunthorpe, Daniel Borkmann, and Neil Horman.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the bug and ensure proper functioning of IPv6 SCTP sockets with IPv4 connections.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue where the panel goes blank when reopening the lid on a laptop with PCH. This issue is reported and tested by Hugh Dickins, adding credibility to the problem.

The patch itself moves the call to set the BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL register after enabling the BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL2 and BLC_PWM_PCH_CTL1 registers. This change ensures that the BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL register is not cleared to zero when the other two registers are enabled, which is likely causing the blank panel issue.

The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating their agreement with the changes.

The code changes in the patch are focused and directly address the reported issue without introducing any trivial fixes.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that causes a display issue, which qualifies it for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the details:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug reported by Torsten Wagner and Michael Gulick. The bug is related to using the wrong register for computing the display bpp, which affects the bandwidth calculation.

2. The bug has been reported in the Bugzilla database, indicating that it is a real issue that needs to be fixed.

3. The patch modifies the code in the nv50_disp_intr_unk20_2 function in the nv50.c file.

4. The change involves adjusting the register used for computing the display bpp from 0x610798 to 0x610794.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that affects the display bpp calculation, which can lead to incorrect bandwidth calculation. This bug can potentially cause display issues or performance problems, making it a critical issue to address.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to checking the return value of request_any_context_irq() in the adc_jack_probe() function of the extcon-adc-jack.c driver. The patch ensures that the function returns 0 on success and handles the error case correctly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that improves error handling and return value checking.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to queued TRIM commands on certain Micron and Crucial SSD drives. The patch updates the blacklist in the libata-core.c file to reflect the changes in firmware versions and drive models.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It addresses a real issue related to data corruption and improves the compatibility of the affected drives with queued TRIM commands.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the provided information and the changes made in the patch:

1. The patch addresses an issue where after hotplugging CPU1, the first call of the interrupt handler for CPU1 oneshot timer was called on CPU0 because it fired before setting IRQ affinity. This issue affects SoCs where Multi Core Timer interrupts are shared, specifically Exynos 4210.

2. The proposed solution is to register the clock event device after setting the affinity for the interrupt. This change aims to prevent the timer from starting too early.

3. The patch is signed-off by Krzysztof Kozlowski and Thomas Gleixner, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause incorrect behavior in systems with shared Multi Core Timer interrupts. The proposed solution appears to be reasonable and targeted at fixing the issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a type mismatch issue reported by the sparse tool. The issue is related to the assignment of the "packed_cmd_hdr" variable in the mmc_blk_packed_hdr_wrq_prep() function. The expected type is "unsigned int" but the actual type is "__le32" (little-endian 32-bit integer).

The patch correctly annotates the "packed_cmd_hdr" variable with the "__le32" type, resolving the type mismatch issue. This change ensures proper endianness handling and avoids potential data corruption.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that could lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects an incorrect left shift operation in the vortex_wt_setdsout function in the au88x0_synth.c file. The patch changes the line "temp &= (1 << ~(wt & 0x1f));" to "temp &= ~(1 << (wt & 0x1f));".

Since this patch is a cleanup and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an additional argument to the function `break_stripe_batch_list` in the `md/raid5.c` file. The new argument `handle_flags` is used to determine whether or not to set the `STRIPE_HANDLE` flag on individual stripes.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a minor enhancement to the existing code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ARM audit code related to syscall tracing. The bug causes incorrect usage of the saved application ip register and can lead to libc corruption if the ip register is live. This issue can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

The patch addresses the problem by using the "why" parameter to infer the syscall direction and updating the saved ip register only if a ptrace trap will be signaled. This ensures that the saved ip register is not clobbered when the current task is not being traced.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that can potentially lead to data corruption and improves the correctness of the syscall tracing code for ARM architecture.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption in the UDF filesystem. The bug is related to a race condition between two O_APPEND writes, which can lead to overwriting kernel buffers beyond the inode and potentially corrupting the filesystem.

The patch addresses the issue by acquiring the i_mutex lock before checking whether the write fits into the inode and using __generic_file_aio_write() to ensure that the check and write operations are performed within one critical section. Additionally, the patch includes a WARN_ON_ONCE statement to verify that the i_mutex lock is held in the udf_expand_file_adinicb() function.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can lead to data corruption, and the fix itself seems appropriate and targeted.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the QP1 GRH flow in the build_mlx_header procedure. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is:

pci/hotplug/pnv-php: Remove WARN_ON() in pnv_php_put_slot()

The patch removes a WARN_ON() statement in the pnv_php_put_slot() function. The WARN_ON() statement is causing an unnecessary backtrace when putting the parent slot, which is likely to be NULL.

The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that removes a WARN_ON() statement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes or issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change made in the patch is to initialize the `tls` variable with `target->thread.tls_ptr` instead of leaving it uninitialized. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to MDIO phy device refcounting in the of_mdio driver. The patch ensures that the reference count on the phy device is properly managed when phy_connect_direct() or phy_attach_direct() fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a more minor issue related to reference counting.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a mask issue in the max3421-hcd driver related to the GPIO control register.

2. The patch author and sign-offs indicate that it has been reviewed and approved by Jaewon Kim and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the calculation of the mask used for GPIO output control. Previously, the mask was calculated as "1u << pin_number", but now it is calculated as "1u << (pin_number % 4)".

4. The comment in the code states that the GPIO control register is divided into IOPINS1 and IOPINS2, and the low 4 bits control the output.

5. The patch ensures that the mask is correctly calculated by using the modulo operator to limit the pin_number to values between 0 and 3, which corresponds to the low 4 bits of the GPIO control register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug in the max3421-hcd driver related to the mask calculation for GPIO output control. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect GPIO output behavior, which can cause issues in the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freeing the per-net sysctl table on net exit in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) module. The bug is causing an unreferenced object and triggering kmemleak warnings.

The patch includes the following changes:
1. Fixes a spelling error in the sysctl_header variable name.
2. Adds a kfree() call to free the ctl_table structure.

Considering the nature of the bug and the changes made in the patch, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to memory leaks. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and the accompanying explanation, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here are the reasons for my recommendation:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that introduced a regression in the 3.6-rc kernels. The original commit was intended to fix a blank panel issue when reopening the lid, but it caused further problems due to lacking locking in the backlight code.

2. The lack of locking in the backlight code can lead to race conditions, which can result in system instability or data corruption. This qualifies as a real and critical bug that needs to be addressed.

3. The patch author acknowledges that further hacks or workarounds should not be attempted until the underlying race conditions are fixed. This demonstrates a cautious approach to maintaining stability and avoiding potential issues.

4. The patch includes references to relevant discussions and bug reports, providing additional context and supporting evidence for the decision to revert the previous commit.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the function `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count` in the `drivers/base/power/opp.c` file. It adds RCU (Read-Copy Update) lock protection to ensure that the function is called under the appropriate lock.

The patch addresses the issue of callers not correctly handling the RCU lock requirement when calling `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count`. By taking the RCU lock inside the function, it simplifies the usage for callers and ensures proper synchronization.

The change itself does not fix a specific bug or introduce any new functionality. It is more of a code improvement to enforce correct locking semantics. Therefore, it does not fall into the category of fixing a real and critical bug, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the answer is (B) - it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lock-inversion problem in the xHCI driver. The issue is related to threaded interrupts and the use of spin_lock() instead of spin_lock_irqsave(). The patch modifies the xhci_irq() function to use spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_unlock_irqrestore() instead of spin_lock() and spin_unlock().

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a deadlock. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the firmware loader. The patch ensures that all pending loading requests on the same firmware buffer can see the mapped 'buf->data' once the loading is completed. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, it addresses a race condition in the firmware loader, which can lead to incorrect behavior or potential issues.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the race condition can potentially cause unexpected behavior or data corruption.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch addresses a specific race condition and does not include trivial changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The comment in the code states that the failure is persistent, which means it can cause issues that are not easily recoverable. This qualifies as a critical bug.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications. The changes made are necessary to fix the bug.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch are straightforward and do not appear to introduce any new bugs or regressions.

4. The patch is specific to the powerpc architecture: The changes made in the patch are specific to the powerpc architecture and do not affect other architectures. This ensures that the patch is targeted and does not have any unintended consequences on other platforms.

Considering these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug related to transactional memory software abort cause codes on the powerpc architecture.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to GPU hangs with certain revisions of the Skylake GT3/GT4 graphics. The patch extends the workaround to cover all revisions, which resolves the hang issue observed during the Heaven 4.0 GPU benchmark.

The patch also references a previous commit that addressed a similar problem with enabling GT4e and extends the fix to revision F0. In retrospect, it is mentioned that the fix should have covered this issue earlier, as the discrepancy between revisions E0 and F0 was suspicious enough.

The patch includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags, as well as references to the bug report and the patch's origin. It also mentions that the patch has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to GPU hangs and extends the fix to cover all relevant revisions.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the tty_wait_until_sent function in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses an issue where the function may take up to twice as long as the requested timeout while waiting for driver and hardware buffers to drain.

The patch modifies the code to take the remaining number of jiffies (a unit of time in the Linux kernel) into account after waiting for driver buffers to drain. This ensures that the timeout actually becomes a maximum timeout as documented.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential timing issue that could impact the proper functioning of the TTY subsystem, which qualifies as a critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to pid allocation in a pid namespace when the init process dies. The bug can lead to processes attempting to access their child reaper and following a stale pointer. Additionally, the patch avoids the problem of waitpid for init returning before all processes in the pid namespace have exited.

The patch modifies the following files:
- include/linux/pid.h
- include/linux/pid_namespace.h
- kernel/pid.c
- kernel/pid_namespace.c

The changes in the patch include adding a new function `disable_pid_allocation()` in `pid.h` and modifying the `struct pid_namespace` in `pid_namespace.h` to include a new flag `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING`. In `pid.c`, the `free_pid()` function is modified to schedule work when the process is exiting, and the `alloc_pid()` function is modified to check if pid allocation is disabled before proceeding. Finally, in `pid_namespace.c`, the `create_pid_namespace()` function is modified to set the `nr_hashed` flag to `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING`, and the `zap_pid_ns_processes()` function is modified to disable further pid allocation.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to pid allocation in a pid namespace when the init process dies.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: "dirty flag was mistakenly being cleared when promoting via overwrite." This indicates that there was a bug causing incorrect behavior in the code.

2. The patch modifies the "migration_success_post_commit" function in the "dm-cache-target.c" file.

3. In the else branch of the function, there is a conditional statement checking if "mg->requeue_holder" is true. If it is true, the "clear_dirty" function is called to clear the dirty flag for the cache block.

4. However, if "mg->requeue_holder" is false, indicating that the block was promoted via an overwrite, the patch sets the dirty flag for the cache block using the "set_dirty" function.

5. The patch also includes a comment explaining the reason for setting the block as dirty when it is promoted via an overwrite.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a specific bug that could lead to incorrect behavior when promoting via overwrite. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue that could potentially cause data corruption or other problems.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes an issue where skb->truesize is underestimated in tcp_trim_head() when dealing with looped skbs. This bug can be triggered using syzkaller and a filter attached to a TCP socket over the loopback interface.

2. The bug can lead to a "WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len)" warning in skb_try_coalesce(). This indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

3. The patch modifies the __pskb_trim_head() function to return the trimmed length as an integer value. Previously, the function had a void return type.

4. In the tcp_trim_head() function, the patch assigns the return value of __pskb_trim_head() to the variable "delta_truesize". This allows for proper adjustment of skb->truesize and other related variables.

5. The patch correctly updates skb->truesize, sk->sk_wmem_queued, and performs necessary memory accounting adjustments using sk_mem_uncharge().

6. The patch also sets the SOCK_QUEUE_SHRUNK flag to indicate that the socket queue has been shrunk.

7. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Reported-by tags, indicating the author and the person who reported the bug. It also includes a Tested-by tag, indicating that the patch has been tested successfully.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to skb->truesize underestimation and provides the necessary adjustments to address the issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to the sh73a0 CPU board and the irqdomain support. The patch fixes the RELOC_BASE value in the INTCA IRQ pins description to resolve a conflict between the two controllers.

However, without further context or details about the severity of the issue, it is difficult to determine whether this patch qualifies as a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not seem to address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the specific issue and its impact would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes a null pointer dereference when mounting NFS over v4.1. This qualifies as a real and critical bug.

2. The patch modifies the backchannel TCP operations by adding the "alloc_slot" function. This indicates that it is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The call trace shows that the null pointer dereference occurs in the "xprt_reserve" function from the "sunrpc" module. The patch adds the "alloc_slot" function to the backchannel TCP operations, which should prevent the null pointer dereference.

4. The patch is signed-off by two individuals, Bryan Schumaker and Trond Myklebust, who are associated with NetApp. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and testing.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the null pointer dereference issue when mounting NFS over v4.1.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the radar_required field in the mac80211 module. The bug causes a stale radar_required field, which prevents starting new scan requests. The patch addresses this issue by clearing the radar_required field when ieee80211_vif_use_channel() fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a critical bug that can potentially cause issues with scan requests. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real and critical issue related to corrupted file systems and directory entries pointing at reserved metadata inodes. The patch introduces a new function called `ext4_iget_normal()` which is used for directory tree lookups.

The purpose of this patch is to mark reserved metadata inodes as bad inodes, preventing them from being opened, deleted, or modified. This is done to avoid potential issues, such as data corruption or system instability, that can occur when a corrupted file system has a directory entry pointing at the journal inode.

The patch includes changes in three different files: `fs/ext4/inode.c`, `fs/ext4/namei.c`, and `fs/ext4/super.c`. In `fs/ext4/inode.c`, the new function `ext4_iget_normal()` is defined, which checks if the inode number is within a valid range and returns an error if it is not. In `fs/ext4/namei.c` and `fs/ext4/super.c`, the new function is used instead of the existing `ext4_iget()` function for obtaining inodes.

Considering the critical nature of the issue being addressed and the fact that the patch introduces a new function to handle the specific case, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the UBI (Unsorted Block Images) driver. The patch corrects the use of "VID" vs. "EC" in the header self-check computation.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the physical active state on the GIC distributor in a preemptible section. This issue could potentially lead to setting the active state on a different physical CPU than the one intended, causing havoc.

2. The patch proposes a solution by moving the timer flush into a non-preemptible section. This ensures that the active state is set correctly on the intended CPU.

3. The patch has been reviewed by Marc Zyngier and signed-off by Christoffer Dall.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect behavior and potential system instability. The fix itself does not appear to be trivial, as it involves modifying the timing behavior in a preemptible context.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ibmvnic driver. The patch corrects a mistake in the failure path of the ibmvnic_open() function, where a second call to napi_enable() is made instead of calling napi_disable(). This mistake can lead to a BUG_ON condition for any queues that were enabled in the previous call to napi_enable().

Since this bug can potentially cause issues such as hangs or data corruption, it meets the criteria for a critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to preventing timeline updates while performing a reset in the drm/i915 driver. The patch adds locks to prevent modifications to the list of requests on the timeline while it is being walked.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a situation where the mac80211 state machine gets confused because the csa_active flag is not cleared, leading to potential issues with the connection.

The patch adds a check to disconnect if the time event for CSA (Channel Switch Announcement) fails to start. This is considered a safe action to take in this case.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue: "Fix accidental enable of buck4 ramp delay." This indicates that there was a bug causing an unintended enablement of ramp delay for buck4.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the fix. It states that the bit shift for enabling buck4 ramp delay in the register is equal to 0, which resulted in the ramp delay being enabled for bucks that do not support enable/disable (buck[56789] and buck10).

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug. This helps in tracking the history of the issue and ensures that the fix is applied to the correct code.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

5. The code changes in the patch are focused and limited to the specific issue being addressed. It checks the regulator ID to ensure that ramp delay can only be enabled/disabled for buck[1234], preventing the accidental enablement for unsupported bucks.

6. The patch includes error handling in case the enablement of ramp rate fails, providing proper error messages and returning the appropriate error code.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the enablement of ramp delay for buck4. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (1414abea048e0835c43600d62808ed8163897227) that restricted the Virtual Function (VF) from configuring any VLAN mode. Reverting this commit allows any VLAN to be configured from the VF.

2. The reason given for reverting the commit is to allow the same multicast address to be used with any VLAN instead of programming separate (MAC, VLAN) tuples in the adapter. This is intended to save some multicast filters.

3. The patch removes the definitions for QLC_MAC_STAR_ADD and QLC_MAC_STAR_DEL, which were used to check if MAC + any VLAN filter is allowed from the VF. This check is now removed.

4. The patch also removes the check for BIT_8 in qlcnic_sriov_validate_cfg_macvlan function, which could potentially lead to invalid configurations being accepted.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is removing important checks and restrictions related to VLAN configuration from the VF. Without these checks, there is a possibility of allowing invalid configurations or potentially introducing security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to power management (PM) runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ platforms. The patch aims to disable PM runtime when using the default PM domain with PM_CLK, as it may prevent the registration of the real Clock Domain from the device tree (DT) later.

The patch also mentions that most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms now use DT-based PM domains for PM runtime management of module clocks. The patch replaces explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT, simplifying the platform logic.

Additionally, the patch ensures backward compatibility with old DTs by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to PM runtime management and improves the platform logic for multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms. However, without further context or information about the severity of the bug or the impact it has on the system, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The commit being reverted is 23c405912b88.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the following criteria:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch reverts a previous commit that fixed a memory leak. Memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and instability, so fixing them is generally considered critical.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The bug being fixed is a memory leak, which can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially impact system stability. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, or data corruption, it can still have a significant impact on system performance and reliability.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch only removes a call to kfree() for par_dev->state. Without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this change is trivial or not. If par_dev->state is no longer needed or is being handled elsewhere, then this change may be considered non-trivial.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Reverting the previous fix for the memory leak indicates that there may be issues with the original fix, and it is important to address memory leaks to ensure system stability and performance. However, further investigation and understanding of the context surrounding par_dev->state would be necessary to fully assess the impact of this change.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the release of the MMC host after a discard operation. The patch fixes the problem by marking the special request down before the discard/flush operation.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The bug is described as setting `map_and_fenceable` to true when the object is not bound to the global GTT, which violates the change introduced in a previous patch. This bug can lead to incorrect behavior and needs to be fixed.

2. The bug fix is critical: The bug can cause incorrect behavior in the system, which can impact performance or functionality. It is important to fix such critical bugs to ensure the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific bug mentioned.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: The patch has been reviewed by Daniel Vetter and tested by multiple individuals, including huax.lu@intel.com and Valtteri Rantala. This adds credibility to the patch and increases confidence in its effectiveness.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and improve the stability of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a manual call to `mvneta_adjust_link()` in the `mvneta_ioctl()` function. The patch suggests that `mvneta_adjust_link()` should not be called directly and should instead be called as a callback for `of_phy_connect()`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for a firmware issue in the igb i210 NIC. The patch adds an additional zeroing of the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register during the igb_get_phy_id function to address the problem.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not address any of the mentioned critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a workaround for a specific firmware initialization problem. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a workaround for a non-critical issue rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the enabling of the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt in the ravb driver. The patch does not provide any explanation or justification for this change.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an issue that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant problems.

However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is intended to address, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. As an AI, I cannot make assumptions or speculate on the potential impact of this change without more details.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until more information is provided about the bug or issue it is intended to fix.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to releasing overlays in the OMAPFB driver. The patch ensures that overlays are properly removed from overlay managers, preventing a crash when omapfb is unbound and bound or when the omapfb module is removed and loaded while keeping omapdss around.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a crash. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

6. The change is relatively small and focused, making it less likely to introduce new issues.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a "use-after-free" scenario and cause a panic. This bug was originally caught in RHEL6.4, indicating its severity.

2. The bug occurs due to a small race between copy_process() and cgroup_attach_task(), where child->se.parent,cfs_rq points to invalid (old) ones.

3. The worst-case scenario is that the old cgroup (and related data) can be freed before accessing child->se.parent,cfs_rq, leading to a panic.

4. The patch fixes the race condition by calling __set_task_cpu() to ensure that child->se.parent,cfs_rq point to valid ones, considering that the cpu and task_group of the parent might have changed.

5. The patch is signed-off by two developers and has been reviewed by the Linux kernel community.

Given the severity of the bug and the provided fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent potential panics and ensure system stability.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that can lead to a panic at kfree in mei_release(). The bug is caused by not setting the client's read_cb pointer to NULL when flow control fails in mei_cl_read_start(). This can result in the read_cb pointer pointing to random memory, leading to potential issues when the client is operated later.

Considering that the bug can cause a panic and potentially impact system stability, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the error passive level test in the pch_can driver. The patch modifies the condition for checking whether the receive error counter has reached the error passive level.

The original condition (((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) > 127) is incorrect because the receive error counter is limited to a maximum value of 127. The patch suggests using the RP bit (15) to determine if the error passive level has been reached.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses an incorrect condition that prevents the correct detection of the error passive level.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues directly. However, it could lead to incorrect behavior in error handling and reporting in the pch_can driver.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a logical error in the code.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug in the pch_can driver without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a regression issue in the mtd: gpmi driver. The regression causes the inability to mount the ubifs created by the old NAND ECC layout. The patch reverts to the legacy ECC layout to address this issue.

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to fix a critical issue related to the transfer hangs during I2C frame transmission on certain devices. The issue is resolved by reducing the internal frequency of the TWI IP. The patch does not impact the I2C bus frequency.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to meet the requirements. It addresses a real and critical bug that causes a hang during I2C frame transmission, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The code is confused between a PHY and a generic MDIO device due to the presence of a compatible value in some PHY nodes.

2. The patch fixes the issue by adding a whitelist of PHY compatibilities. If a compatible value from the whitelist is found, a warning is issued to indicate that it is a PHY.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it resolves a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.

4. The patch has been reported and tested by multiple individuals, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause confusion in differentiating between PHYs and generic MDIO devices. It also includes proper documentation and has been tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to information leakage in the L2CAP code of the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch initializes the `l2_bdaddr_type` member of `struct sockaddr_l2` and the padding byte for alignment, which prevents the leakage of two bytes of kernel stack memory via the `getsockname()` syscall.

Considering that this patch addresses a security issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the reiserfs filesystem where the commit workqueue is not freed when mount fails. This can lead to resource leaks and potential instability.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause potential issues such as resource leaks. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a regression caused by a previous patch that reverted code necessary for handling dirty pages. The regression caused issues when the lower file was closed before the dirty pages were written out. 

The patch proposes a better approach to ensure that the lower file is still open when writing out the dirty pages. It calls the function `filemap_write_and_wait()` from `ecryptfs_release()` just before the lower file is closed. This ensures that the dirty pages are written out before the final `fput()` and pointer overwrite.

Considering that this patch addresses a regression and fixes a critical issue related to dirty pages not being properly written out, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a generic quirk for matching Insyde devices in the bytcr_rt5640 driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The previous limitation of setting the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to a maximum of 1500 prevented them from taking advantage of jumbo frames and other larger MTU sizes. This limitation can be considered a significant issue.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the MTU calculation and allowing larger MTU values for vxlan devices.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch do not seem to introduce any new bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The modifications are focused on relaxing the MTU constraints for vxlan devices.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug and does not introduce any new issues.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a registration failure issue in the s5p-g2d driver. The failure causes a boot warning and the driver fails to register the video device. The patch adds the missing assignment of the v4l2_dev field to the video_device structure, which is expected by the commit "[media] v4l2: always require v4l2_dev, rename parent to dev_parent".

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch should be accepted (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that causes a failure in registering the video device, which can lead to a non-functional or unstable system. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a data corruption issue that occurs when changing serial settings on some PL2303 devices, even if the settings are the same as before.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: The patch mentions that some PL2303 devices lose bytes when serial settings are changed, leading to data corruption.

3. The fix is non-trivial: The patch introduces a comparison between the encoded settings and the previously used settings before configuring the device. This ensures that unnecessary settings updates are avoided, preventing data corruption.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

5. The patch includes appropriate documentation: The patch includes a clear description of the problem and the solution, making it easier for future maintainers to understand the changes.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and introduces a non-trivial fix to prevent the issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the preparation of a port STP update in the net/dsa/slave.c file. The issue is that a driver may return -EOPNOTSUPP from the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev. This issue has been reported by Andrew Lunn and the patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by him.

The patch modifies the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function by introducing the variables "p" and "ds" to access the parent switch and slave private data. It also modifies the logic for handling SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE attribute. If switchdev_trans_ph_prepare returns true, it checks if the driver supports port_stp_update and sets ret accordingly. Otherwise, it calls the port_stp_update function with the appropriate arguments.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that can cause a WARN() and improves the handling of the SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE attribute.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW accessing the freed buffers, potentially causing a host crash. The patch addresses this by deregistering the MR in the firmware (FW) before freeing the fast_reg_page_list.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a host crash, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to address the issue of unsafe list traversal when walking EEH (Enhanced Error Handling) devices in the powerpc architecture.

2. The current implementation uses `list_for_each_entry()` to traverse the EEH devices list. However, this method is not safe enough because the EEH devices might be removed from its parent PE while iterating.

3. The patch replaces `list_for_each_entry()` with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe list traversal.

4. The `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` macro is modified to include an additional argument `tmp` for safe iteration.

5. The patch is applied to three different files: `arch/powerpc/include/asm/eeh.h`, `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c`, and `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_pe.c`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue of unsafe list traversal in the powerpc architecture and provides a safer alternative.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the missing xcopy_pt_cmd->sense_buffer[] in the target_core_xcopy.c file. The patch adds the necessary sense_buffer to handle CHECK_CONDITION exceptions within the locally generated XCOPY I/O path.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug: Yes, it adds the missing sense_buffer, which is required for correct exception handling in the XCOPY I/O path.

2. The bug is critical: It is not explicitly mentioned whether the bug is critical or not. We need more information to determine the severity of the bug.

3. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: It is not explicitly mentioned whether the bug causes any of these issues. We need more information to determine the impact of the bug.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on adding the missing sense_buffer.

Based on the available information, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or if it causes any severe issues. Without this information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and analysis of the bug and its impact before deciding whether to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes corruption on the display and reference counting issues due to fences for pinned objects not being restored upon resume.

2. The bug was introduced in commit 312817a39f17dbb4de000165b5b724e3728cd91c, which was part of the Linux kernel version 2.6.38.

3. The bug was reported by Stéphane Marchesin and confirmed by the patch author, Chris Wilson.

4. The patch restores the functionality of restoring fences after resume and GPU resets, which fixes the bug.

Based on these points, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent display corruption and reference counting issues.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the pch_uart driver. The bug causes a memory access violation when the UART processing acts in DMA mode. The patch fixes this issue by allocating the DMA channel whenever pch_uart_verify_port() is called and the channel is not already allocated.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to memory access violations, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a call to `plane->destroy` from the `omap_crtc_destroy` function in `omap_crtc.c`. The patch states that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework, so the explicit call to `plane->destroy` is no longer needed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To analyze the given Linux kernel patch, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a comment explaining the scenario where an RPC client is no longer held by anyone except the notification callback after its dentries were created.

2. The patch sets the per-net PipeFS superblock before sending a MOUNT notification for the RPC client.

3. The patch handles the case where the MOUNT notification fails by calling the RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification and cleaning up the RPC client.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific scenario where the per-net PipeFS superblock needs to be set before sending a MOUNT notification, ensuring proper cleanup and preventing potential issues with the RPC client.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not take into account any broader context or dependencies.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

5. The patch is signed off by Dmitry Torokhov, who is a maintainer of the drivers/input/tablet/wacom_sys.c file.

6. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the wacom_retrieve_report_data() function.

7. In the original code, the address of rep_data is passed to wacom_get_report() as an argument.

8. The patch changes this by passing rep_data directly, without taking its address.

9. The change is made because rep_data is no longer an array.

10. The patch also updates the function call to wacom_get_report() by removing the unnecessary address-of operator.

11. The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value and has been reviewed, tested, and signed off by multiple individuals, including the maintainer of the relevant file.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to dropped Rx data in the spi-topcliff-pch driver. The patch modifies the pch_spi_handler_sub function to correctly handle the transfer complete interrupt.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or loss. The patch ensures that the transfer is completed before informing pch_spi_process_messages and properly handles the interrupt condition.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real problem and does not contain any trivial changes. However, it is important to note that further testing and verification should be conducted to ensure the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning reported by Linus Torvalds, indicating a potential undefined behavior in the code.
2. The warning is caused by a loop that iterates from 0 to 3, but the array `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` only has two members. This results in overwriting the last two iterations, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Although the bug seems benign in practice because the overwritten values are not used, it is still a valid issue that needs to be fixed.
4. Linus Torvalds has acknowledged the bug and pulled the patch, but suggests that the fix should be made.
5. The proposed fix changes the size of the array `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct approach to address the issue.
6. The patch includes the necessary changes to fix the bug by replacing the hardcoded size of the array with the `MAX_RF_PATH` macro.

Considering the above analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a real bug that can potentially lead to undefined behavior.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/i915/gen9: Add WaFbcTurnOffFbcWatermark". According to the bspec (presumably the Intel Graphics Programmer's Reference Manual), this patch prevents screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch adds a new workaround to the gen9_init_clock_gating function in the intel_pm.c file. It writes a value to the DISP_ARB_CTL register to turn off the FBC watermark for the skl, bxt, and kbl platforms.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to screen corruption when FBC is used. It also includes references and has been reviewed by relevant individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The use of ACCESS_ONCE() in the code causes a kernel stack overflow when building with gcc-5 and CONFIG_KASAN=y. This is a serious issue that can lead to system instability and crashes.

2. The bug causes build errors: The error messages indicate that the frame size of certain functions exceeds the allowed limit, resulting in build errors. This can prevent the affected code from being compiled and used correctly.

3. The patch removes the problematic ACCESS_ONCE() macro: The patch removes the use of ACCESS_ONCE() and directly accesses the register addresses. The author has verified that this change improves the object code generated by the compiler and resolves the stack overflow issue.

4. The patch has been tested: The author mentions testing the patch with gcc-5.3.1 and gcc-7.0.0, confirming that the object code is improved and the issue is resolved.

5. The patch is not urgent for the current kernel version: The author notes that the issue only affects builds with certain compilers and CONFIG_KASAN=y. However, it is still recommended to backport the patch to older kernels to avoid the serious issue for affected users.

Considering these points, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent potential system instability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up in the MediaTek Ethernet driver. The patch adds a loop to stop all devices and properly shut down the DMA before removing the module.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses an issue related to driver removal and DMA shutdown.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a -stable release. As a result, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to replace the usage of `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `truncate_pagecache()` in the `ext4_collapse_range()` function in the `fs/ext4/extents.c` file. The rationale behind this change is that `truncate_pagecache()` is more appropriate for truncating the page cache from the specified offset to the end of the file, and it also handles the removal of private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description that this change fixes a bug. However, it seems to be a functional improvement rather than a bug fix.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   There is no indication that the patch introduces any build errors, oopses, hangs, or data corruption.

3. Does the patch address a real security issue?
   There is no mention of a security issue being addressed by this patch.

4. Does the patch fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not mention any specific issue that it addresses, so it is unclear if it fixes an "oh, that's not good" issue.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   Based on the provided information, it does not seem that the patch contains any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the above analysis, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis of the code and its impact would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug related to the s3c_hsotg_phy_disable function being called multiple times during driver removal, which causes the phy reference counter to go below zero. This bug can lead to module insertion failures.

The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from both s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions. It explains that s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which in turn calls s3c_hsotg_pullup, where s3c_hsotg_phy_disable is already called. Therefore, there is no need to disable the phy again in s3c_hsotg_remove.

The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Samsung, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by them.

Considering that the patch addresses a real bug that can cause module insertion failures and that it removes redundant code, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch introduces a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM, allowing the HCR (Hypervisor Configuration Register) to be changed on a per-vCPU basis.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freezing groups with stopped tasks in the cgroup freezer subsystem. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it in the original locations where freezing is checked.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix. The testcase involves creating a freezer cgroup, starting a background process, stopping it, and then checking if the freezer state transitions to "FROZEN" correctly.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to freezing groups with stopped tasks and provides a proper solution by reintroducing the necessary function and using it appropriately. Additionally, the inclusion of a testcase adds further confidence in the patch's effectiveness.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The current code is causing a splat (kernel warning) during the netns destroy path, indicating a potential issue.

2. The bug is critical: The warning message suggests that there is a directory leak ('IN-REJECT') in the net/ip6t_hashlimit directory, which is a serious issue.

3. The patch fixes the bug: It adds the necessary code to remove both IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories in the netns destroy path, ensuring proper cleanup.

4. The fix does not contain trivial changes: The patch focuses on fixing the bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch is signed-off by relevant contributors: It has been signed-off by Sergey Popovich and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and prevent the directory leak in the net/ip6t_hashlimit directory.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a possible issue in case the pdev name contains formatting characters. This indicates that there might be a vulnerability related to the pdev name.

2. The issue was reported by Kees Cook from Google, which suggests that it has been identified as a security concern.

3. The patch modifies the code at line 237, replacing the snprintf function with strlcpy to copy the pdev name to p2wi->adapter.name.

4. The use of strlcpy ensures that the destination buffer is not overflowed, which is a good practice for preventing buffer overflows and potential security vulnerabilities.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to a potential security issue. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific vulnerability. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue reported is that the igb driver was unmapping buffers without calling dma_mapping_error. This can lead to potential data corruption or other issues.

2. The patch modifies the DMA debug API to handle multiple mappings of the same buffer correctly. It fixes the issue where the map_err_type was not being set correctly for multiple mappings.

3. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Shuah Khan and Joerg Roedel, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to DMA mappings.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the issue being addressed is passing the correct pointer to the `free_irq()` function in the `rtc-pl031.c` driver. The patch fixes this issue by passing the correct pointer (`ldata`) instead of `ldata->rtc`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch fixes a bug where the incorrect pointer was being passed to `free_irq()`, which could lead to issues with freeing the IRQ.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues directly. However, passing the incorrect pointer to `free_irq()` can lead to potential issues with freeing the IRQ, which could result in unexpected behavior or instability.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the bug may not directly cause critical issues, it addresses a potential problem with freeing the IRQ correctly, which can help maintain stability and prevent unexpected behavior.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "hwmon: (f75375s) Fix bit shifting in f75375_write16". It suggests a fix for a bit shifting issue in the f75375_write16 function of the f75375s hardware monitoring driver.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix a bug related to remote attribute invalidation for a leaf block in the XFS file system. It addresses a recent rework of the remote attribute format and ensures the correct calculation of attribute length in the xfs_attr3_leaf_inactive() function.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the xfs_attr3_leaf_inactive() function in the fs/xfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c file. Specifically, it updates the calculation of the attribute length by using the xfs_attr3_rmt_blocks() function instead of XFS_B_TO_FSB().

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to remote attribute invalidation in the XFS file system. It is not a trivial fix, as it involves updating the calculation of attribute length. However, without further context or knowledge about the bug itself, it is difficult to determine the severity or impact of the issue being fixed.

4. Decision:
   Given the limited information available, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the bug being fixed is critical or falls under the "oh, that's not good" category. Therefore, I cannot confidently recommend accepting or rejecting this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Please provide additional information or context about the bug being fixed, if available, to further evaluate its severity and impact.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "KVM: ioapic: fix assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi (CVE-2014-0155)". The patch aims to fix a bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

The patch description mentions that a BUG_ON is triggered in the ioapic_service function. Although the author cannot reproduce it, they provide two possible reasons for the bug.

The first reason mentioned is when kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic does not deliver to any APIC and returns -1. This can happen if the kvm_for_each_vcpu loop in the function is never reached because irqe.shorthand == 0. The author suggests targeting the similar loop in kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast and programming a zero logical destination address into the IOAPIC or an out-of-range physical destination address.

The patch itself modifies the ioapic_service function by updating the assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi. It sets it to 0 if ret is less than 0, otherwise, it sets it to ret.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially cause a build error, an oops, or a hang. It does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch aims to address an issue with the firmware's secondary_cpu_start on exynos mcpm systems. The firmware is hardcoded to jump to an address in SRAM when secondary CPUs come up. The code at that location expects the kernel to fill in certain slots with addresses used to jump back to the kernel's entry point for secondary CPUs.

The patch proposes to stop relying on the code provided by the bootloader and instead use its own code to jump to the kernel. This change is beneficial as it fixes potential problems caused by older bootloaders that may have placed different code into the specified location.

Additionally, the patch includes a comment about the need to reinstall the fixed code after suspend/resume, which is not new since the address of the mcpm_entry_point is lost across suspend/resume.

Considering the information provided, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to the firmware's secondary_cpu_start on exynos mcpm systems. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any new issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new functions `task_ppid_nr_ns()` and `task_ppid_nr()` to abstract the lookup of the PPID (real_parent's pid_t) of a process, including rcu locking, in the arbitrary and init_pid_ns. These functions provide an alternative to `sys_getppid()`, which is relative to the child process' pid namespace.

The patch also includes a new function `pid_alive()` which checks if a process is alive based on its task structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding new functionality rather than fixing an existing issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the transmission handling in the dw_mmc driver. The issue is described as a sequence break and lock-up that occurs when the IDMAC interrupt sets EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE regardless of DTO rising.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a sequence break and lock-up issue.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? Yes, the issue described can lead to a lock-up.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? The patch does not mention any security-related concerns.

4. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK):

1. The patch is fixing a bug related to the emit_udiv() function in the ARM architecture for BPF_ALU | BPF_DIV | BPF_K instructions.

2. The patch addresses an issue where the jit_udiv() function is called with the same dividend and divisor when rn == ARM_R0 (r_scratch) and rm is loaded into ARM_R0 first.

3. The proposed fix is to load rn first into ARM_R1 and then rm into ARM_R0 to avoid overwriting ARM_R0 with rm before using it as a source for ARM_R1.

4. The patch includes additional comments explaining the register overlap issues for different BPF_ALU | BPF_DIV | BPF_X instructions.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect calculations in the ARM architecture for specific BPF instructions. The fix is straightforward and does not introduce any trivial changes.
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes the sane_reclaim() helper function in the vmscan.c file.
2. The helper function is modified to return false for memcg reclaim if the legacy hierarchy is used.
3. This change is necessary because the legacy hierarchy lacks a dirty throttling mechanism.
4. The patch fixes an accidental breakage caused by commit 33398cf2f360c ("memcg: export struct mem_cgroup").
5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue related to the memcg reclaim process and ensures that the sane_reclaim() helper function behaves correctly when the legacy hierarchy is used.

4. Code Changes:
   The code change in question modifies the loop condition in the digi_read_oob_callback() function. The original loop condition was "i < urb->actual_length - 4", and the patch changes it to "i < urb->actual_length - 3".

   The original loop condition subtracts 4 from the actual_length, while the modified condition subtracts 3. This change effectively fixes the off-by-one error introduced by the previous fix.

5. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to unnoticed modem-status changes and break TIOCMGET functionality. The patch fixes the off-by-one error introduced by a previous fix.

   Considering the severity of the bug and the fact that it has been reported by a reliable source, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a typo in the documentation and removes two bits from the DMA channel status register when reading it. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses an issue related to requests that completed while IO was frozen in the DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) driver. It ensures that the connection_lost_while_pending and resend events are applied to requests on the barrier_acked_requests list.

The patch modifies the `__req_mod` function in `drbd_req.c` and the `w_after_conn_state_ch` function in `drbd_state.c`. In `__req_mod`, a check is added to complete local-only READ requests. In `w_after_conn_state_ch`, the `tl_clear` function is replaced with `_tl_restart` and `_conn_request_state` functions, and a spin lock is introduced.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to completing requests that were pending during IO suspension. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the request handling logic and introducing a spin lock.

Considering the patch's purpose and the changes made, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a bug related to missing cleanup in the persistent_ctr error path.
2. It addresses a memory leak issue where memory allocated for 'pstore' and 'metadata_wq' is not properly destroyed.
3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the bug.
4. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Considering these points, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause memory leaks. Therefore, it meets the criteria of fixing a critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error caused by uninitialized data usage in the hns_dsaf_set_promisc_tcam() function. The error is flagged by gcc-7.0.1, indicating a potential issue with uninitialized variables 'tbl_tcam_data.low.val' and 'tbl_tcam_data.high.val'. 

The patch initializes the 'tbl_tcam_data' and 'tbl_tcam_mask' structures using memset() before configuring the key mask. This ensures that the data is properly initialized and avoids potential issues with uninitialized data.

Considering the patch fixes a build error and addresses a potential issue with uninitialized data, it can be categorized as a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the SP (Spatial Reuse Protocol) in the mac80211 subsystem.

2. The issue is described as follows: When a frame is enqueued during the SP and carries the IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP bit, the SP is not closed properly. This can lead to a situation where WLAN_STA_SP is never cleared, preventing the opening of new SPs and the response to poll frames from the client.

3. The patch manually clears the WLAN_STA_SP flag if a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU (Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit) session. This ensures that even if the client does not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

4. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Alesya Shapira, and signed-off-by tags from Emmanuel Grumbach and Johannes Berg.

5. The patch also removes an erroneous comment, which is considered a trivial fix.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to the SP in the mac80211 subsystem and provides a necessary fix to ensure proper SP handling. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan process. Currently, if usb-stor-scan freezes, another thread waiting on scanning to complete may fail to freeze. To avoid this, the patch introduces changes to usb-stor-scan.

The patch replaces the set_freezable() function with set_freezable_with_signal() to request a fake signal when freezing. This change ensures that the freezer will wait for usb-stor-scan to exit, and threads waiting for scanning to finish will no longer be blocked.

Additionally, the patch replaces wait_event_freezable_timeout() with wait_event_interruptible_timeout() to avoid freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread. This change allows the thread to be interruptible and wake up early when freezing happens.

The patch includes proper documentation explaining the rationale behind the changes and the potential issues that could arise if freezing is not handled correctly.

Overall, the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause freezing and potential hangs. It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on improving the stability and reliability of the usb-stor-scan process. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses the issue of increased CPU load average caused by the SENSE_PORT command.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues directly. However, an increased CPU load average can impact system performance and responsiveness.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). While the issue may not be critical in terms of causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it addresses a performance-related concern that can impact system behavior.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses an issue in the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the nau8825 codec. It fixes an incorrect configuration of the clk_ref_div in the Pre-Scalar of the FLL (Frequency-Locked Loop) register.

Looking at the code changes, it appears that the clk_ref_div value is being assigned directly to the NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK field. However, the correct behavior should be to shift the clk_ref_div value by NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT bits before assigning it to the NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK field.

The patch correctly modifies the code to shift the clk_ref_div value before assigning it to the NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK field:

```
regmap_update_bits(nau8825->regmap, NAU8825_REG_FLL4,
                   NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK,
                   fll_param->clk_ref_div << NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT);
```

Additionally, the patch includes the necessary changes in the nau8825.h header file to define the NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT and NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK macros correctly.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a real bug in the nau8825 ASoC driver that could potentially lead to incorrect configuration of the clk_ref_div value. This bug does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. However, it can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the correct functioning of the FLL.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It is a relatively trivial fix that does not address a critical bug or a significant issue. Therefore, the correct decision would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) feature in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to correct the judgment of the last shadow byte in the memory_is_poisoned_16() function.

After analyzing the patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the alignment of memory and the corresponding shadow bytes. It aims to optimize the code by avoiding unnecessary function calls when the memory is aligned on 8 bytes.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Andrey Ryabinin, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review.

4. The patch does not introduce any new risks or regressions. It only modifies the judgment condition in the existing code.

Considering these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the identified bug in the KASAN feature.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an endianness issue when reading the status of the MMA9553 accelerometer. The original code incorrectly assumed the endianness of the received buffer, leading to incorrect values for the step count and activity.

The patch refactors the code for simplicity and clarity and fixes the endianness issue by using a buffer of 16-bit words instead of a single 32-bit variable. The status and step count values are then extracted correctly from the buffer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses an endianness issue, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The change is described as a "NOP" (no operation) and only involves a semantic correction in the rt6_clean_expires() function.

Since the patch does not fix any functional issue, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical problem, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition that can lead to a "setup link failed with code -14" error when certain commands are executed. The patch protects the setup_link call with a check for __IXGBE_IN_SFP_INIT to prevent the race condition.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The driver does not generate an alarm interrupt even though a time for an alarm is set. This bug can potentially lead to missed alarms and incorrect behavior.

2. The patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the driver maintains its enabled state for rtc_clk until the alarm interrupt occurs. It introduces a new function, s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable, which enables or disables the rtc_clk based on the enable parameter.

3. The patch also makes the s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_lock variable local to the s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable function, which improves code encapsulation and reduces potential conflicts with other parts of the codebase.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including the original author and maintainers.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to bridge windows and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug introduced by commit e8e89622ed361c46bf90ba4828e685a8b603f7e5, which caused a might_sleep warning in atomic context due to holding the fence_lock spinlock over a kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) call.

2. The proposed fix is to revert the above commit and only take the lock where it is needed, specifically around the call to ->sync_obj_ref.

3. The patch includes additional fixes suggested by Maarten Lankhorst:
   a. Fixing a locking bug.
   b. Removing the need for kzalloc by clearing the entire structure on the next line.
   c. Checking for bo->sync_obj and clearing fbo->sync_obj if it is already cleared.

4. The patch is reported by Dave Airlie and signed-off by Daniel Vetter and Dave Airlie.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to fence locking in the ttm_buffer_object_transfer function.

true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Description of the issue:
   The patch addresses an off-by-one error in the continuation handling of /proc/net/route. When generating /proc/net/route, a header is emitted followed by a line for each route. If a short read is performed, the process is restarted based on the open file descriptor. However, when calculating the start point, the patch identifies that the 0th entry (header) is not taken into account, leading to skipping the first entry when doing a continuation read.

2. Impact of the issue:
   The issue causes the first non-title element to be lost in the "while read" case and an entry around the 8K mark in the "cat" case. This indicates that the off-by-one error results in missing important route information.

3. Fix provided by the patch:
   The patch fixes the off-by-one error by adjusting the position calculation when reacquiring the position on continuation.

4. Fixes and Acknowledgments:
   The patch references a previous commit that introduced the issue and provides a BugLink to a bug report related to the issue. It also includes an Acked-by tag from Alexander Duyck and Signed-off-by tags from Andy Whitcroft and David S. Miller.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The off-by-one error can lead to missing critical route information, which can impact network functionality and cause potential issues. The patch provides a straightforward fix for the issue and has received acknowledgments from relevant individuals.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow issue in the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE calculation. This is a real bug that can potentially cause issues such as ASan failing to map shadow memory for PIE binaries when ASLR is disabled.

2. The patch fixes the overflow by dividing TASK_SIZE prior to multiplying, ensuring that the calculation does not exceed 32 bits.

3. The patch has been reported by Maria Guseva and signed-off by Andrey Ryabinin, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The patch also includes a reference to a relevant document explaining the issue and its impact.

5. The patch has been CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, suggesting that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a deadlock issue between rmmod and set_mode in the IB/ipoib driver. The deadlock occurs due to a conflicting lock acquisition order between the sys/fs lock and the rtnl_lock.

The patch modifies the set_mode function to check if ipoib_set_mode returned -EBUSY, indicating that the rtnl_lock was not released. In such cases, the rtnl_lock is not unlocked again. This change prevents the deadlock from occurring.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch aims to fix alignment issues for ARM64 in the v4l2-compat-ioctl32 module.
   - It addresses the need to properly match compatible ioctls on ARM64 kernels without breaking AMD64.
   - The patch was signed-off by Andrzej Hajda, Hans Verkuil, and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch modifies the struct `v4l2_standard32` by replacing the `id` field, which was an array of two `__u32` elements, with a single `compat_u64` field.
   - The `compat_u64` type ensures proper alignment for ARM64.
   - The patch also removes the `__attribute__ ((packed))` attribute from the `v4l2_input32` struct.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses an alignment issue specific to ARM64 architecture.
   - It does not fix any critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.
   - The changes made in the patch are related to alignment and padding, which are not considered critical issues.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the flush_tlb_range() function. The patch adds the necessary locking mechanism to ensure that the ->page_table_lock is held when the ->mmap_sem is not held. This is important because some page table flushing instances explicitly work with page tables.

The patch also mentions that all other callers already hold either ->mmap_sem (exclusive) or ->page_table_lock, except for this specific caller. It further explains that almost all callers are fine, as flush_tlb_range() may not need to play with page tables, but it can do so safely. This specific caller is the only exception.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to locking and synchronization in the flush_tlb_range() function. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a necessary locking mechanism. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of the f_midi_opts_id_show() function in the f_midi.c file can cause a segmentation fault when trying to read the 'id' attribute, which is initialized with a NULL pointer.

2. The bug can lead to a build error, an oops, or a hang: The reproduction path shows that attempting to read the 'id' attribute results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference, causing an internal error (Oops) and potentially leading to a system hang.

3. The patch fixes the issue: The patch modifies the f_midi_opts_id_show() function to check if the 'id' attribute is NULL before attempting to read it. If it is NULL, the function returns an empty string instead of trying to copy the NULL pointer, preventing the segmentation fault.

4. The fix is not trivial: The patch introduces a conditional check and handles the NULL case explicitly, ensuring that the function does not dereference a NULL pointer. This is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and prevent potential system issues.

3. The original offset is kept around, but the internal array offset is adjusted by shifting it by one bit.

4. The condition for checking the offset is changed from `offset & 2` to `offset & 4`.

5. The condition for checking the offset in the write operation is changed from `offset < 4` to `offset < 8`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the GICD_ICFGR register accesses in the KVM code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. However, without further context or knowledge about the severity of the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release (i.e., fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential soft-lockup issue caused by deleting an uninitialized and unscheduled command timer in the xhci_mem_cleanup() function. The patch checks if the command timer is pending before deleting it to avoid the soft-lockup.

Considering the patch addresses a potential hang issue, it can be categorized as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the invocation of iommu_add_device() during the EEH hotplug event in the powerpc/powernv architecture. It is observed that iommu_add_device() is invoked three times, and two of these invocations trigger warnings or errors.

The first invocation fails because the dev->kobj->sd is not initialized, which is only done in the device_add() function. The third invocation triggers a warning due to the re-attachment of the iommu_group.

The patch aims to resolve this issue by removing the iommu_add_device() call in the pnv_pci_ioda_dma_dev_setup() function, reverting part of the change made in commit d905c5df.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses an issue that causes warnings and errors during the EEH hotplug event.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The current implementation of bpf_get_current_comm() in the kernel uses memcpy() to copy the task's comm (command) string into a buffer. However, this can result in copying junk bytes beyond the null-terminated string, which can cause spurious hash map mismatches. The patch addresses this issue by using strlcpy() instead, which guarantees a zero-terminated string.

2. The bug can cause "oh, that's not good" issue: The bug in the current implementation of bpf_get_current_comm() can lead to spurious hash map mismatches. While this may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption, it can still result in unexpected behavior and incorrect results, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to the bpf_get_current_comm() function.

4. The patch does not introduce any security concerns: The patch explicitly mentions that the issue is not a security concern since kprobe+bpf is root-only.

5. The patch includes relevant information: The patch includes a reference to the commit that introduced the issue, the name of the person who reported it, and the sign-offs from the relevant developers.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug that can cause an "oh, that's not good" issue without introducing any trivial fixes or security concerns.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the issue being addressed is a recursive call of the `mtd_writev` function in the `block2mtd` driver.

The patch changes the assignment of the capabilities field to the device_caps field in both files. It also adds the V4L2_CAP_TUNER flag to the device_caps field. Additionally, it sets the capabilities field to the combination of device_caps, V4L2_CAP_VBI_CAPTURE, V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE, and V4L2_CAP_DEVICE_CAPS.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a warning and ensures that the capabilities and device_caps fields are correctly set in the vidioc_querycap function.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the bnx2x driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes incorrect configuration of the VF interrupt scheme, leading to interrupt generation issues for VFs using multiple queues.

The patch modifies the bnx2x_vf_igu_reset() function in the bnx2x_sriov.c file. It updates the calculation of the parent PF value used for configuring the VF interrupt scheme. Instead of using BP_FUNC(bp), it uses (BP_ABS_FUNC(bp) >> 1) to correctly identify the parent PF.

The patch also includes additional debug information to print the value in IGU_REG_VF_CONFIGURATION after the write operation.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause interrupt generation issues for VFs using multiple queues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that cleans up some unused assignments in the code.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a bug related to bookkeeping of the skb (socket buffer) during the batching process in the hv_netvsc driver. It fixes an issue where the previous skb is not properly freed, which could potentially lead to a panic.

The patch introduces a new structure member, `struct sk_buff *skb`, in the `struct multi_send_data` to hold the skb of the batched packet. It also adds a new function, `move_pkt_msd()`, to move the packet out of the `multi_send_data` structure and clear it.

In the `netvsc_send()` function, the patch modifies the code to use the `move_pkt_msd()` function to move the packet out of `multi_send_data` and clear it. It also updates the handling of `skb` to properly free it when necessary.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to a panic. It introduces necessary changes to fix the issue and ensures proper bookkeeping of the skb during the batching process.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes an issue in the uvc driver where the "length" field in the uvc_request_data structure is changed from unsigned int to __s32 (signed 32-bit integer). This change allows the "length" field to be used to signal an error when set to a negative value.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The change from unsigned int to __s32 is not a trivial fix, as it involves changing the data type of the field and potentially affects the behavior of the driver.

3. The patch has been reported and signed-off by relevant individuals: The patch has been reported by Fernandez Gonzalo and signed-off by Laurent Pinchart. It also includes the sign-off from Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is a well-known maintainer of the Linux kernel.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logical omission in the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() function in the dwc2 USB driver. The patch addresses memory manipulation issues and ensures that Host DDMA bulk transfers work correctly. It also fixes a bug introduced in a previous patch that caused the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() function to return a failure status even when the descriptor was processed normally.

The patch includes changes to the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() function and the dwc2_complete_non_isoc_xfer_ddma() function. It modifies the error handling logic in dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() to properly handle failures and stop processing remaining descriptors. It also adds a label to stop scanning descriptors in the dwc2_complete_non_isoc_xfer_ddma() function.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues in the USB driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix the REGSET_VX_LOW vector register ELF notes in the s390/kdump code. Currently, the upper halves of the first sixteen 128-bit vector registers are being copied instead of the lower halves. The patch intends to correct this by copying the lower halves correctly.

The patch adds necessary locking to protect the modification of `alloc_blocks` in two instances, ensuring that concurrent access does not lead to allocation bitmap corruption.

The patch also includes the removal of an unused label and takes a copy of `->alloc_blocks` after acquiring the `extents_lock` mutex.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems appropriate to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption and improves the stability and reliability of the HFS+ file system implementation in the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to residue calculation in the pxa_dma driver.
2. The issue occurs in a very specific corner case where the transfer is ongoing and the current transfer pointer just changed to the "finisher/linker" descriptor.
3. In this case, the residue returned is the whole transfer length instead of 0, which is incorrect.
4. The patch fixes this issue by adding a check to ensure that the current transfer pointer is read before checking the descriptor completion.
5. The patch also includes a comment explaining the reason for reading the current transfer pointer before the check.
6. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

This patch simply adds two additional product IDs for the Petatel NP10T modem to the existing list of USB devices in the option.c file. It seems to be a proactive update to ensure compatibility with future devices. 

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not fixing a real bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the provided information and the changes made in the code:

1. The patch aims to replace the use of VM_NO_THP and VM_BUG_ON with an actual VMA check in the mm/huge_memory.c file.

2. The issue being addressed is that khugepaged (a kernel thread responsible for collapsing transparent huge pages) cannot distinguish private /dev/zero mappings from other special mappings like /dev/hpet, which has no vm_ops and populates PTEs in mmap. This leads to false-positive VM_BUG_ON and incorrect installation of Transparent Huge Pages (THP) where they are not expected.

3. The patch fixes the false-positive VM_BUG_ON and prevents the installation of THP in unexpected cases.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to THP installation and ensures correct behavior by replacing the incorrect check with an actual VMA check. Additionally, the patch has received Acked-by tags from multiple developers, indicating their approval of the fix.

However, please note that the final decision to include the patch in the stable release lies with the Linux kernel maintainers.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the detection of BREAK on the sunsab serial console. The patch ensures that the check for BREAK and the corresponding call to uart_handle_break() are performed even when there are no received characters.

It fixes a real bug in the HID cp2112 driver that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant maintainers, and it meets the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch description mentions that there is an issue tracking the last flush of the VM, which results in hangs in certain cases when the VM is used. Hangs can be considered a critical issue as they can lead to system instability and user frustration.

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch modifies the radeon_ib_schedule function in the radeon_ring.c file to always flush the VM for every IB. This ensures that the last flush of the VM is properly tracked, preventing the hangs mentioned in the bug reports.

3. The bug reports confirm the issue: The patch references two bug reports (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62959 and https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62997) that describe the problem. These bug reports provide additional evidence that the issue is real and needs to be addressed.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific bug mentioned.

Considering these factors, I believe that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug causing hangs in certain cases when the VM is used.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a potential null pointer access issue in the brcmf_msgbuf_get_pktid() function. The patch adds a check to ensure that the return pointer is not NULL before accessing it, which helps to avoid a crash caused by a kernel NULL pointer dereference.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential crash issue, it can be categorized as fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to comply with the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it aims to comply with the "fw_restart" module parameter on suspend.

2. The patch description explains that when the suspend flow fails, the hardware is restarted to return to the D0 image. However, it mentions that the patch does not comply with the "fw_restart" module parameter in this scenario.

3. The rationale behind complying with the "fw_restart" flag is to avoid clearing everything up and losing the firmware state when an error occurs during the start of the D3 image. This is important for debugging purposes.

4. The patch modifies the "__iwl_mvm_suspend" function in the "d3.c" file of the iwlwifi driver.

5. Within the function, it adds a conditional check to decrement the "restart_fw" counter and only restart the hardware if the counter is greater than zero.

6. If the counter is not greater than zero, the patch proceeds with the existing code, which includes freeing resources and not restarting the hardware.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue related to firmware state loss during suspend and provides a mechanism for debugging if errors occur during the start of the D3 image.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc64 architecture. The warning indicates that the function `find_numa_latencies_for_group()` references the function `find_mlgroup()` without the appropriate `__init` annotation.

The patch addresses this issue by adding the `__init` annotation to both `find_numa_latencies_for_group()` and `find_best_numa_node_for_mlgroup()` functions. This ensures that these functions are only called during the initialization phase.

Considering the patch's purpose is to fix a section mismatch warning and does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be categorized as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a potential crash in the __netdev_pick_tx() function in the bridge code. The bug is triggered when a packet is received on a NIC using skb_mark_napi_id(). The patch clears the sender_cpu field in the skb structure before forwarding it, similar to the fix made in the xps code.

Considering that the bug can potentially cause a crash, it falls under the category of a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the function `cpsw_ale_stop` from the `cpsw_ale_destroy` function in the `cpsw_ale.c` file. The reason for this change is to address a deadlock issue that occurs when the `ti_cpsw` module is inserted and removed, causing a delete timer to be created and destroyed.

The deadlock issue is triggered when the `ti_cpsw` module is removed using `modprobe -r ti_cpsw`, resulting in a lock acquisition error and a stall detected by the RCU scheduler.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a deadlock and a stall in the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the VMWare EFI BIOS exposing port 0x5658 as an ACPI resource. This causes the port to be reserved by the ACPI module, making it unavailable for other drivers to reserve. The patch removes the attempt by the VMMOUSE driver to reserve this port on its own.

The rationale behind this change is that the port is designed to be shared among multiple VMWare services, including VMMOUSE. By removing the port reservation in the VMMOUSE driver, it allows other drivers to reserve the port if needed.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It directly addresses the issue at hand.

Overall, this patch fixes a specific problem related to port reservation in the VMMOUSE driver and improves compatibility with VMWare EFI BIOS. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to session recovery in NFSv4.1. The patch addresses a hang that occurs when a client attempts to lock a file while session recovery is in progress. 

The patch modifies the code to wait for session recovery to finish before retrying the lock. This change ensures that the open recovery is scheduled and completed before proceeding with the lock attempt.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "mac80211: stop polling in disassociation." It suggests stopping the connection monitor poll during disassociation to clear the polling flags and run any deferred scans.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue where a scan is deferred due to connection monitoring during disassociation. This can cause problems connecting to another access point (AP) as the scan blocks further scan requests until the interface is brought down and up again.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "ieee80211_set_disassoc" and "ieee80211_sta_connection_lost" functions to stop the polling before disassociation.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can cause problems with connecting to other APs and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the Realtek ALC889 audio codec on VAIO Z machines. The patch addresses a regression that causes silent output from the speaker. 

The patch introduces a fix-up that selects the speaker pin as the primary output, ensuring that the correct DAC is assigned on this device. It also adds a new fixup function, `alc882_fixup_no_primary_hp`, which prevents the HP output from being taken as the primary output on VAIO Z machines.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a specific regression causing silent output, it seems to fix a real and critical bug. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make a definitive decision, it would be necessary to evaluate the impact of the bug, the risk of introducing regressions or new issues, and the overall stability and reliability of the patch. Additionally, it would be helpful to review any testing and feedback provided by the reporter and other users.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to fix a race condition between the connected_handler and teardown flow in the iser-target module.

2. The patch takes the isert_conn pointer from cm_id->qp->qp_context to ensure that the cm_id context is always the network portal. This improves the reliability of the cm_id event check.

3. To avoid a NULL dereference in cma_id->qp->qp_context, the patch destroys the qp after destroying the cm_id, making the dereference safe. This accounts for the possibility of parallel session establishment/teardown sequences.

4. The patch also protects the decrement of isert_conn->conn_device->active_qps within the error patch during QP creation failure and the normal teardown path in isert_connect_release().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to a race condition and ensures the reliability of the cm_id event check. It also includes necessary protections to avoid NULL dereferences and handle error scenarios correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple return value modification that does not address any significant problem.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform, which indicates that it addresses a specific hardware compatibility issue. This is a valid reason for inclusion in a stable release.

2. The patch includes changes to the "davinci_emac.txt" documentation file, which suggests that it provides necessary information for users and developers. Documentation updates are generally considered important and can be included in stable releases.

3. The patch modifies the "davinci_emac.c" file, which is the driver implementation for the emac controller. Changes to the driver code can introduce new functionality or fix existing bugs. If the changes address critical issues, such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities, they should be included in stable releases.

4. The patch introduces a new compatible string, "ti,dm816-emac," indicating support for the dm816x platform. This suggests that the patch enables the emac controller to work correctly on this platform. If the dm816x platform is widely used and the emac controller has known issues on it, this patch would be valuable for stable releases.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it adds support for a specific hardware platform and potentially addresses critical issues. However, without further information about the severity of the issues or the importance of the dm816x platform, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "s390/kdump: Clear subchannel ID to signal non-CCW/SCSI IPL". 

The patch description explains that there are use cases where an intermediate boot kernel uses kexec to boot the final production kernel. In this scenario, the original boot information should be provided to the production kernel. Therefore, clearing the boot information during kexec should not be done.

Looking at the code changes, the lines that clear the subchannel ID and number have been removed. These lines were previously used to signal the new kernel that no CCW or SCSI IPL has been done during kexec and kdump.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is reverting a change that was causing issues in certain use cases. It does not fix a critical bug, but rather restores functionality that was previously present. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be addressing a specific erratum related to the P2020/P2010 processors. The erratum, known as eTSEC 20, causes excess delays when transmitting large frames with TOE (TCP/IP hardware accelerations) enabled. This issue was fixed in Revision 2.0 of the processors.

The patch enables a workaround for this erratum by checking the processor version and applying the appropriate errata flag. If the processor is a P2020 or P2010 with a revision lower than 0x20, the GFAR_ERRATA_76 flag is set.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to address a real and critical bug that can cause delays in transmitting large frames with TOE enabled. It is not a trivial fix as it involves enabling a specific workaround for a known hardware issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xHCI (USB 3.0) host controller driver. The bug causes a race condition between URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer, potentially leading to an oops in xhci_giveback_urb_in_irq().

The patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue(), handle_stopped_endpoint(), xhci_stop_endpoint_command_watchdog(), finish_td(), and xhci_queue_isoc_tx() functions to ensure that TDs (Transfer Descriptors) are properly removed from the TD lists and cancelled TD lists before giving back the URB.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential hang and data corruption issue, which qualifies as a real and critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture in the KVM module. The patch addresses a problem where the advancing of the program counter (PC) when completing an MMIO load is done before re-entering the guest, which can lead to unsafe access to guest code.

The patch introduces a precalculation of the resume PC while still in the right context and saves it in the `vcpu->arch.io_pc` field. This value is then restored on MMIO completion. Additionally, the `vcpu->arch.pending_load_cause` field is replaced with `vcpu->arch.io_pc` to store the resume PC.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a specific bug related to MMIO load completion and ensures the correct handling of the resume PC. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug and its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted or not for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Further analysis and understanding of the bug and its impact would be necessary to make an informed decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to interrupt timeout handling in the net/mvmdio driver. The patch ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, which guarantees that wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to timeouts and incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for handling power-gating flags properly in the AMDGPU driver for VCE (Video Codec Engine). Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to verify if the power-gating (pg) flag for VCE is disabled. If it is disabled, the function returns without attempting to start or stop the VCE block.

2. The patch is reviewed by Eric Huang and signed-off by Alex Deucher, both from AMD.

3. In the vce_v2_0_set_powergating_state() function in vce_v2_0.c, the check for the pg flag is added before performing any power-gating operations. If the state is AMD_PG_STATE_GATE, it returns without stopping the VCE.

4. Similarly, in the vce_v3_0_set_powergating_state() function in vce_v3_0.c, the check for the pg flag is added before performing any power-gating operations. If the state is AMD_PG_STATE_GATE, it returns without stopping the VCE.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue with power-gating in the AMDGPU driver for VCE and ensures that the VCE block is not started or stopped when the pg flag is disabled. This fix is relevant and critical for proper functioning of the VCE feature and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch initializes the network_header and transport_header in vnet_rx_one() function in the sunvnet.c file.

2. It checks if the vio_version is greater than or equal to 1.8 and if the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag is set in the dext structure.

3. If the skb protocol is ETH_P_IP, it initializes the iph variable as the IP header of the skb.

4. It sets the iph->check field to 0 and recalculates the IP checksum using ip_send_check().

5. It checks if the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag is set and if skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE.

6. If the skb protocol is ETH_P_IP, it initializes the iph variable as the IP header of the skb and calculates the IP header length (ihl).

7. It resets the transport header of the skb and sets it to the correct offset using skb_reset_transport_header() and skb_set_transport_header().

8. Finally, it calls the vnet_fullcsum() function to compute the full checksum for the skb.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to checksum calculation for IPv4 packets in the sunvnet driver. It ensures that the network_header and transport_header are properly initialized and the checksum calculations are performed correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or security issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload). The bug occurs when the buffer is within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of a 4G boundary. The patch introduces a workaround to detect this condition and trigger the workaround path.

Considering that data corruption is a critical issue, and this patch addresses a specific hardware-related bug, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, to make a more accurate assessment, it would be helpful to have additional information such as the severity of the data corruption and any potential impact on system stability or security.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply moves the `omap_hsmmc_context_save(host)` function call from before the `pm_runtime_use_autosuspend(host->dev)` call to after it.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves a minor code rearrangement, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to a double fetch bug in the ioctl function of the cros_ec_dev driver in the platform/chrome directory.

2. The patch verifies the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" to ensure they have not changed between the two copy_from_user() calls. This check is important to prevent a potential buffer overflow.

3. The patch also handles a scenario where cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value. In such cases, the patch ensures that the new smaller value is used to avoid copying too much data to the user.

4. The patch includes the necessary metadata, such as the reported-by, fixes, signed-off-by, reviewed-by, and tested-by tags.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a buffer overflow. The changes made in the patch are necessary to ensure the correct behavior of the driver and prevent any potential security issues or data corruption.

Please note that the final decision should be made by the Linux kernel maintainers, who have a deeper understanding of the codebase and its implications.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a merge error and initializes a missing variable. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to an information leak in AUDIT_GET requests. The patch initializes the "mask" member of the "status_set" structure to zero, which prevents the leakage of 4 bytes of kernel stack.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real bug that could potentially lead to information leakage. It does not seem to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in the block/blk-ioc.c file. It replaces the existing double lock dancing with a trylock approach on the queue_lock. If the trylock succeeds, it performs the necessary operations and releases the lock. If the trylock fails, it releases the ioc lock, performs a CPU relax, and then reacquires the ioc lock.

From a code perspective, the changes seem reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues. However, to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier.

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug?
   The patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue it addresses. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if it fixes a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not introduce any obvious build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other problematic issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on simplifying the code logic.

Based on the information available, it is not clear whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug. However, it does not introduce any obvious issues and does not contain trivial fixes. Therefore, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further information and testing would be necessary to make a more definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to event processing delay and potential data halt and disconnection on the AP interface when it coexists with a STA. The patch requeues work after the scan is complete for all VIF types, ensuring that event processing is not delayed or ignored.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and connectivity issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The incorrect usage of the int type for page indices in the btrfs_page_exists_in_range function can lead to unexpected failures and incorrect results.

2. The bug can cause issues in various scenarios, such as hole punching and direct locking, where the presence of pages in a specific range needs to be accurately determined.

3. The consequences of the bug include potential data corruption and stale data reads, which can have a significant impact on the system's integrity and functionality.

4. The patch provides the correct types (unsigned long) for the page indices, ensuring that offsets larger than 1 << 44 are handled correctly.

5. The patch includes relevant information, such as the explanation of the bug, its impact, and the scenarios where it can occur.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny.

Considering these factors, it appears that this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue in the KVM virtual interrupt controller (vgic) code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses a problem where the active state of an interrupt is checked incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior when external inputs need to access the state of a virtual interrupt.

2. Impact: The patch addresses a bug that can cause incorrect behavior in the handling of virtual interrupts. While the patch does not explicitly mention any specific impact, it is implied that the bug can lead to incorrect behavior in the architected timer code and potentially affect other external inputs as well.

3. Reported-by and Acked-by: The patch has been reported by Eric Auger and Acked by Marc Zyngier, indicating that the bug has been identified and acknowledged by experts in the field.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the kvm_vgic_map_is_active() function in the vgic.c file. It replaces the existing check for dist_active_irq(vcpu) with a new function vgic_irq_is_active(vcpu, map->virt_irq), which correctly checks if the specific IRQ in question is active on the distributor.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the KVM virtual interrupt controller code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. The bug can potentially cause incorrect behavior in interrupt handling, which qualifies it as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: a memory leak in the HID multitouch driver.
2. The issue occurs because the `mt_free_input_name()` function is not called during the `.remove()` operation, resulting in allocated memory not being freed.
3. The patch fixes the issue by restoring the original name before freeing it to avoid accessing an already freed pointer.
4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors.
5. The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they fix a real bug that could potentially lead to memory leaks.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that could cause memory leaks, and the changes made are not trivial.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch addresses an issue in the Btrfs file system where new chunks were not being allocated correctly when considering missing devices. This caused problems when trying to allocate new chunks with a higher RAID level on a degraded file system.

The patch modifies the code by removing the count of missing devices when calculating the number of devices for allocating new chunks. This ensures that new chunks are allocated correctly, even if there are missing devices.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues on a degraded Btrfs file system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address two issues:

1. Allowing the media manager to be initialized without a storage backend for device drivers like null_blk.
2. Fixing incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, specifically the get/set bad block interface.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze each change:

1. The first change modifies the null_lnvm_id() function in drivers/block/null_blk.c. It updates the id->cap value from 0x3 to 0x2. This change does not seem to fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues. It appears to be a trivial fix, possibly a configuration adjustment. Therefore, this change does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. (NAK)

2. The second change modifies the nvm_register() function in drivers/lightnvm/core.c. It adds a conditional check to ensure that the device supports the get/set bad block interface before attempting to initialize the media manager. This change seems to address a specific issue related to incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk. It is a functional fix that prevents potential errors during device initialization. Therefore, this change meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. (ACK)

Based on the analysis of the patch, it should be partially accepted. The change in drivers/lightnvm/core.c should be accepted, while the change in drivers/block/null_blk.c should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing iounmap issue in the rtc-at91rm9200.c driver. The patch adds the necessary iounmap function call in the error path of the probe function. This fix prevents a potential resource leak and ensures proper cleanup in case of an error during the probe.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that addresses a resource leak.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a use-after-free bug in the __put_anon_vma function in the mm/rmap.c file. This bug could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, it addresses a real and critical bug.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It specifically focuses on fixing the use-after-free bug.

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Peter Zijlstra, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses the issue of SCSI devices being created at the OS level for non-existing virtual drives (VD). This indicates a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

2. The patch modifies the "ldTgtIdToLd[]" array, which is used to map logical drives (LD) to target IDs. It sets the LD value to 0xff for device indices beyond 127 (for legacy firmware) and beyond 255 (for extended VD firmware). This ensures that invalid LD values are returned for non-existing targets beyond the specified indices.

3. The patch also includes changes in the "megasas_build_dcdb_fusion()" function in the "megasas_sas_fusion.c" file. It adds a check to prevent accessing "ldTgtIdToLd[]" beyond index 127 for older firmware and beyond the supported VD count for extended VD firmware.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to non-existing VDs being exposed to the host. It also includes necessary checks to prevent accessing invalid LD values and ensures compatibility with different firmware versions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug that could lead to incorrect behavior and improves the overall stability and security of the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a debug message from the critical section of the code. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch ensures that the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set earlier, before the inode hash table lock is dropped. Additionally, the find actor now uses only the location objectid to match inodes.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect search results in the inode hash table due to the race condition. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to an invalid buffer lookup in the mtk_tx_map() function in the MediaTek Ethernet driver. The patch corrects a copy & paste error by changing the code to use the correct descriptor pointer.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the information provided, it is not clear whether this bug causes any of the mentioned critical issues. Additionally, the patch does not appear to address any security concerns explicitly. Therefore, without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make a more informed decision, additional details about the bug and its impact would be necessary.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to optimize the irq restore operation in the s390 architecture by using the faster stosm instruction instead of the ssm instruction.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new macro `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` in `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h`.
   - The `arch_local_irq_restore` function is modified to check if the `flags` parameter contains the `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` flag. If it does, it calls `arch_local_irq_enable` to enable interrupts.
   - The `arch_irqs_disabled_flags` function is modified to use the `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` macro instead of a hardcoded value.
   - In `arch/s390/mm/init.c`, the `arch_local_irq_restore` call is replaced with `__arch_local_irq_stosm(0x04)`.

3. Analysis:
   The patch aims to optimize the irq restore operation by using the faster stosm instruction instead of the ssm instruction. It introduces a new macro `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` to represent the enabled interrupt state. The `arch_local_irq_restore` function is modified to only enable interrupts if the `flags` parameter contains the `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` flag. The `arch_irqs_disabled_flags` function is modified to use the `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` macro for consistency.

4. Decision:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is optimizing the irq restore operation in the s390 architecture without introducing any new bugs or issues. It does not fix a critical bug, but it does improve performance. However, since the patch does not address a real and critical bug or security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this decision is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt flags on the Rx LL2 in the qed driver. The problem is that the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can potentially lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() function to pass the lock flags as a pointer and correctly restore the interrupt flags using the updated flags.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix, it seems to be a real and critical bug that can potentially cause incorrect interrupt status. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit b0d0d915, which removed the BKL (Big Kernel Lock) in the ipx module. This regression causes a blocking recvmsg syscall to block a concurrent sendmsg on the same socket, leading to a deadlock scenario.

2. The patch explains that the previous BKL locking was unlocked while sleeping, allowing concurrent sendmsg operations. However, after the removal of BKL, the socket remained locked during the blocking recvmsg, causing the deadlock.

3. The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while working with the socket data and releases it before calling skb_recv_datagram(). This change ensures that the socket is not unnecessarily locked during the blocking recvmsg operation.

4. The patch includes a Signed-off-by line from the author and a Reviewed-by line from another developer, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and tested.

Considering the above points, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a deadlock scenario. It does not contain any trivial fixes and provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue in the scheduler's NUMA task selection. The patch aims to avoid selecting oneself as a swap target, which can lead to problems when trying to acquire the same lock twice for swap migration.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a potential issue that can cause problems with lock acquisition during swap migration.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the issue addressed by the patch does not fall into any of these categories. It is more of a correctness and performance improvement.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to NUMA task selection.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it could be considered for inclusion in future kernel versions or development branches.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the contamination of the percpu pointer with the DEAD flag. The issue arises when the __ref_is_percpu() function races with percpu_ref_kill() and sees the DEAD flag without the ATOMIC flag. The proposed fix updates __ref_is_percpu() to test both the ATOMIC and DEAD flags together before returning the percpu pointer.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch removes a check that restricts the minimum length of GETLAYOUT requests in the nfsd/blocklayout module. This restriction is not allowed according to RFC 5661 section 18.43.3, and it has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some clients. Therefore, this bug can lead to hangs, which qualifies it as a critical issue.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The patch removes the check for minimum length, which is a non-trivial change and not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The patch only removes the check for minimum length, which is necessary to comply with the RFC and prevent hangs. It does not introduce any new code or changes that could potentially cause build errors, oops, data corruption, or security issues.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by trusted developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Christoph Hellwig and J. Bruce Fields, indicating that it has undergone a review process and has been deemed suitable for inclusion in the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug where partitions added by user space to the loop device were not being cleaned up after detaching the loop device.

2. The current implementation issues a BLKRRPART command to clean up partitions if LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN is set, which means that the partitions were auto-scanned on attach.

3. The patch replaces the BLKRRPART command with code that unconditionally cleans up partitions on detach.

4. Additionally, the patch exports the delete_partition() function, which was modified by Jens Axboe.

5. In the loop_clr_fd() function in drivers/block/loop.c, the patch removes the BLKRRPART command and adds code to remove all partitions when max_part=0.

6. The code uses disk_part_iter to iterate over all partitions and delete them using the delete_partition() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
