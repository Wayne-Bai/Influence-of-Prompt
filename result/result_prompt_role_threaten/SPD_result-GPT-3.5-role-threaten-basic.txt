non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch modifies the code related to parsing certificates in the "pe.c" file of the "libyara" module. The changes involve renaming the variables "notBefore" and "notAfter" to "not_before" and "not_after" respectively. These changes seem to be related to improving code readability or consistency rather than addressing any security vulnerabilities.
non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a security patch (SRP). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the GPT header size in the "block/partitions/efi.c" file. This indicates that it is fixing a potential vulnerability or security weakness.

2. The patch ensures that the GPT header is at least the size of the defined structure. This change is necessary to comply with the UEFI 2.3.1D specification, which mandates that the GPT header must be greater than or equal to the size of the structure. By enforcing this requirement, the patch aims to prevent potential security issues that could arise from a malformed header.

3. The patch includes a fix for a printk warning, which suggests that it is addressing a potential issue related to logging or debugging. While not directly security-related, fixing warnings can contribute to overall code quality and maintainability, which indirectly improves security.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple individuals, including the author, reviewers, and maintainers. This indicates that the change has gone through a review process, which is common for security-related patches.

Based on these observations, it is reasonable to classify this patch as a security patch (SRP).
