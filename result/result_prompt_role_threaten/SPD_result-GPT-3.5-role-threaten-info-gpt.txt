The patch is related to the "mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx" driver, specifically modifying the suspend and resume functions. The changes involve using the common sdhci_suspend|resume_host() functions instead of sdhci_pltfm_suspend|resume(). These modifications aim to prepare for making sdhci_pltfm_suspend|resume() static functions.

While this patch may have implications for the stability and performance of the driver, it does not directly address any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses. It seems to be focused on code organization and maintenance rather than security-related concerns.

Therefore, based on the information provided, this patch is classified as a non-security patch (NSP).
non-security || Based on the provided patch, it is difficult to determine whether it is a security patch (SRP) or a non-security patch (NSP) solely based on the information provided. The patch appears to modify the "pe.c" file in the "libyara" module, specifically updating the field names for "notBefore" and "notAfter" to "not_before" and "not_after" respectively. 

Without further context or information about the purpose and impact of these changes, it is not possible to definitively classify this patch as a security patch or a non-security patch. Additional information about the specific vulnerabilities or issues being addressed by this patch would be necessary to make an accurate determination.
non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing an issue related to the size of the GUID Partition Table (GPT) header in the "block/partitions/efi.c" file. The patch ensures that the GPT header is at least the size of the defined structure, as mandated by the UEFI 2.3.1D specification. 

While this patch does address a potential issue, it does not directly relate to fixing a security vulnerability or addressing a security weakness. It is more focused on ensuring the correct behavior and integrity of the GPT header.
non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). Here's the analysis:

1. The commit message does not mention any security-related issues or vulnerabilities being addressed. It primarily focuses on a change in the disassembler's behavior.

2. The code changes in the patch are related to the printing of unit metadata and the handling of strict types in the disassembler. These changes do not directly address security concerns.

3. The added function `print_unit_strict_types` checks a runtime option `PHP7_ScalarTypes` and prints the `.strict` directive based on its value. This change seems to be related to the behavior of the disassembler rather than addressing security vulnerabilities.

4. The patch does not include any changes related to security-specific issues such as input validation, access control, encryption, or authentication.

Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the provided patch is a non-security patch (NSP).
non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a trivial bug in the last commit, which suggests that it is addressing a minor issue rather than a security vulnerability. The changes made in the patch involve modifying the condition in an if statement, specifically changing `result->analysis.font` to `item->analysis.font`. This change indicates that the patch is correcting a mistake in the code logic rather than addressing a security concern.

Therefore, the patch is classified as a non-security patch (NSP).
