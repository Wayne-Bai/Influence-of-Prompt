Explanation: The patch fixes a potential lost wakeup scenario in the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl function in the quatech_usb2 driver. Currently, if the usermode app performs an ioctl using TIOCMIWAIT, the code sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and waits for the URB completion to wake it up. However, there is a race condition between the loop in qt2_ioctl and the URB completion in qt2_process_modem_status, which can result in a lost wakeup scenario.

The patch adds a barrier to ensure memory ordering, sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and sets it back to TASK_RUNNING before returning. This ensures that the usermode app's task will not continue to sleep despite a change in the modem status.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the author and the stable team. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

This patch improves the power management (PM) runtime and phy handling for the omap2430 glue layer in the musb driver. It simplifies the code by allowing idling of both MUSB and PHY when nothing is configured. It also adds a warning if the PHY is not configured.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Tony Lindgren, Bin Liu, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

The changes in the patch include:

1. In the omap2430_musb_init() function, the phy_init() function is called after setting the isr callback. This ensures that the PHY is initialized properly.

2. In the omap2430_musb_enable() function, the phy_power_on() function is called after checking if the PHY is not NULL. This prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference.

3. In the omap2430_musb_disable() function, the phy_power_off() function is called after checking if the PHY is not NULL. This prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference.

4. In the omap2430_musb_exit() function, the phy_exit() function is called to clean up the PHY resources. The musb->phy pointer is also set to NULL to prevent any further access to the PHY.

5. In the omap2430_remove() function, the cancel_work_sync() function is called to cancel any pending work related to the omap_musb_mailbox. This ensures that the work is not executed after the device is unregistered.

6. In the omap2430_runtime_suspend() function, the omap2430_low_level_exit() function is called to clean up the MUSB resources. This ensures that the MUSB is properly suspended.

7. In the omap2430_runtime_resume() function, the omap2430_low_level_init() function is called to initialize the MUSB after resuming from suspend.

Overall, the patch improves the PM runtime and phy handling for the omap2430 glue layer in the musb driver. It fixes potential issues with NULL pointer dereferences and ensures proper initialization and cleanup of the MUSB and PHY. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: 

The patch removes the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the clk-44xx.c, clk-54xx.c, and clk-7xx.c files in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 clock driver. This is necessary because when the gpmc.c file calls clk_get(..., "fck"), it gets a dummy clock with a rate configured to zero. This results in divisions by zero and misconfigured timings, causing devices on the bus to be lost. By removing the gpmc_fck dummy clock, gpmc.c can fail gracefully.

The patch has been Acked by Tero Kristo <t-kristo@ti.com> and is also tagged for stable releases.

This patch adds a check to ensure that a guest which sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value will receive a #GP (General Protection) exception. Currently, if the vmx (Virtual Machine Extensions) supports loading the PAT CR during entry, the value is not checked. This patch adds the necessary check in that case.

The patch modifies the vmx_set_msr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c to call the kvm_mtrr_valid function to check the validity of the PAT CR value. If the value is invalid, the function returns 1, indicating that the patch should not be accepted.

The patch also adds the kvm_mtrr_valid function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c, which checks the validity of the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values. This function is used by the set_msr_mtrr function in the same file to check the validity of the MTRR values. The kvm_mtrr_valid function is exported using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.

Finally, the patch adds the declaration of the kvm_mtrr_valid function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.h.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is necessary to ensure proper handling of invalid PAT CR values in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

Explanation: The patch fixes an issue where the check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK was inverted, causing the hardware to go to full sleep even if there was a pending transmission. The patch correctly checks for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK and only goes to full sleep if it is not set. This ensures that the hardware only goes to full sleep when there are no pending transmissions. The patch also removes the unnecessary check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK in the else if condition. The patch has been reported by Sujith Manoharan and signed-off by Felix Fietkau and John W. Linville. It is also marked for stable release.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Ping Cheng and Jiri Kosina.
true || ACK

This patch fixes an issue with manipulating the FDT after the MMU is disabled in ExitBootServices(). The current implementation may result in alignment faults due to unaligned accesses to RAM. The patch moves the update_fdt_memmap() call to the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() before it calls ExitBootServices(). This is a better place for the call and ensures that the FDT manipulation is done with the MMU on.

The patch also mentions that disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices() is not compliant with the UEFI spec and carries great risk. Therefore, it is important to fix this issue.

The patch has been tested and has a Fixes tag referring to the commit that introduced the issue. It also has the necessary Signed-off-by and Tested-by tags.

Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: The patch fixes a bug in the btrfs file system where fs_info->pending_changes is never cleared. The original code uses cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0), which only clears it if pending_changes is already 0. This can cause problems when mounting btrfs with the inode_cache mount option, as pending_changes will always be 1 even when the file system is frozen. The patch replaces cmpxchg with xchg to ensure that fs_info->pending_changes is always cleared. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been thoroughly reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

Explanation: The patch adds a check to skip adding PWM fan control attributes if DPM (Dynamic Power Management) is disabled. Since PWM fan control is only available with DPM, there is no non-DPM support on amdgpu. Therefore, the sysfs nodes for PWM fan control attributes would never be created if DPM is disabled. The patch adds the check as an extra precaution to avoid any potential crashes. This change does not affect the functionality of the driver when DPM is enabled. Hence, it is safe to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

true || ACK

Explanation: The patch adds a check to ensure that the PFN passed to pfn_to_page() is valid before dereferencing the struct page pointer. This is necessary because on some architectures, the assumption that there is a 1:1 relation between the System RAM iomem region and the kernel direct mapping is not valid. By adding the pfn_valid() check, the patch ensures that both __va() and pfn_to_page() are only called on valid PFNs/physical addresses. This is a necessary fix to prevent potential issues on ARM and arm64 architectures.
true || ACK

This patch fixes an issue with the MACB/GEM driver where the checksum field is not properly initialized, leading to incorrect checksums on transmit.

This patch fixes two bugs related to resizing RAID0 arrays. The first bug is that the code allows setting the available size on each device for RAID0 and Linear devices, even though resizing a RAID0 array in terms of making the devices bigger is not possible. The patch disables this setting to prevent any changes that can affect the effective layout of data.

The second bug is that the reported size by raid0_size() is not accurate, as it does not round the device sizes to chunk sizes. Although the device sizes cannot change now, it is still best to ensure accuracy and safety. The patch modifies raid0_size() to round the device sizes to chunk sizes.

Without this patch, certain operations on a RAID0 array, such as growing the array to the maximum size and then reading to the end of the array, can cause a BUG. These bugs have been present for a long time, so the fix is suitable for any -stable kernel.

This patch addresses a regression caused by commit 520bd7a8b415, which changed the behavior of how mmcblk device indexes are picked. Some platforms rely on fixed mmcblk device indexes, and this change caused their rootfs to be unavailable at hardcoded paths. Instead of reverting the commit, this patch proposes using the same index for the mmcblk device as for the corresponding mmc host device, which is determined by the probe order of mmc host devices. This should meet the expectations of platforms that require fixed mmcblk device indexes.

The patch also has the side effect of using the same index for the mmc host device, the mmcblk device, and the mmc block queue, which clarifies their relationship.

The patch has been reported by Peter Hurley and Laszlo Fiat, and it fixes the issue caused by commit 520bd7a8b415. It has also been tested and signed-off by Ulf Hansson.

Explanation: The patch suggests using truncate_pagecache() instead of truncate_pagecache_range() in the collapse range function in the ext4 file system. The reason for this change is that truncate_pagecache() not only truncates the page cache from the given offset to the end of the file but also gets rid of private COWed pages from the range. This is necessary because the end of the file is going to be shifted. The patch has been signed off by Lukas Czerner and Theodore Ts'o. The change seems reasonable and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

Explanation: The patch fixes a bug where the s3c_hsotg_phy_disable function is called multiple times, causing the phy reference counter to go below zero. The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions. The reasoning behind this is that s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Similarly, s3c_hsotg_remove should only be called after udc_stop, so there is no need to disable the phy again there. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers and is also marked for stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

This patch fixes an integer overflow issue in the ARM architecture where the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE value overflows 32 bits. The patch divides TASK_SIZE prior to multiplying, ensuring that the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE value is correct. This fix is necessary for AddressSanitizer (ASan) to work properly with PIE binaries when ASLR is disabled. Additionally, after Kees's 'split ET_DYN ASLR from mmap ASLR' patchset, PIE binaries have a high chance of loading between 0x2a000000 and 0x40000000, making ASan with PIE incompatible. Therefore, this patch is necessary for proper functionality and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: 

The patch fixes a bug in the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() functions where the use count of md5sig_pool is increased for each tcp md5sig peer. This can lead to incorrect assumptions in tcp_v4_clear_md5_list() and tcp_v6_md5_do_del() functions, which assume that multiple tcp md5sig peers only hold one reference to md5sig_pool.

The patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first tcp md5sig peer. This ensures that the assumptions made in tcp_v4_clear_md5_list() and tcp_v6_md5_do_del() are correct.

The patch also adds checks to free md5sig_pool only when entries4 or entries6 are 0, preventing double freeing of md5sig_pool.

This patch fixes a use-after-free bug in the mac80211 module. The bug occurs when receiving the last fragment of a packet, where all but the first fragment are freed. However, the multicast check for statistics at the end of the function refers to the current skb (the last fragment), causing a use-after-free bug.

The patch modifies the check for multicast frames to also do the accounting, fixing the issue. Since multicast frames cannot be fragmented and this is checked early in the function, the modification is safe.

The patch has been reported by Yosef Khyal and signed-off by Johannes Berg. It is also marked for stable release.

This patch optimizes the irq restore function in the s390 architecture by using the faster stosm instruction instead of the ssm instruction. It also adds a new macro ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED to represent the enabled interrupt state. The patch is signed-off by the author and the changes are limited to the s390 architecture files.

The optimization is based on the knowledge that irqsave/irqrestore only deals with external and I/O interrupts, and irqrestore can transition only from disabled->disabled or disabled->enabled. Therefore, using the faster stosm instruction is safe and improves performance.

The patch also includes a fix in the paging_init function in arch/s390/mm/init.c, where the arch_local_irq_restore call is replaced with __arch_local_irq_stosm(0x04).

Overall, the patch seems well-tested and provides a performance improvement without introducing any new risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

This patch fixes a bug in the qed driver where the interrupt flags are not correctly restored at the end of the processing of the packet.

Explanation: The patch removes a restriction that imposes a minimum length on GETLAYOUT requests in the nfsd/blocklayout module. The patch is necessary because recent Linux clients have started sending GETLAYOUT requests with minlength less than blocksize, which is not allowed according to RFC 5661 section 18.43.3. This restriction has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some clients. Therefore, removing this restriction will improve compatibility and prevent hangs on affected clients. The patch has also been marked for stable release, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

This patch fixes a bug where partitions added by user space to the loop device were not being cleaned up after detaching the loop device.
