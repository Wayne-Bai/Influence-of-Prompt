Considering the potential benefits of using larger metadata chunks on bigger filesystems, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes an obsoleted check in the ext4 file system's namei.c file.
2. The comment in the patch states that the BH (buffer head) cannot be NULL at this point because ext4_read_dirblock() always returns a non-null value.
3. The patch claims that all necessary checks have already been done, implying that the removed check is redundant.
4. The code change replaces the check for a NULL BH with a check for the pointer "de" being greater than or equal to the end of the buffer data plus the block size.
5. If the condition is true, the code sets the error value to 0 and releases the buffer head.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the removed check is unnecessary and can be safely removed. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This wrapper function simplifies the code and improves readability for users of the `device_tx_status` function.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior, it can be considered a safe and beneficial addition to the Linux kernel. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the function `vlv_infoframe_enabled` in the `intel_hdmi.c` file of the `i915` driver. The purpose of this function is to check if the infoframe is enabled for a given encoder.

The patch introduces a new variable `intel_dig_port` of type `struct intel_digital_port` and initializes it with the value of `enc_to_dig_port(encoder)`. This variable represents the digital port associated with the encoder.

Next, the patch adds a new variable `port` and assigns it the value of `intel_dig_port->port`. This variable represents the port associated with the digital port.

The patch then modifies the return statement of the function. It checks if the `port` matches the port value obtained from the register `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK` and if so, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `val` and `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary check to ensure that the infoframe is enabled only for the correct port. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `sch_generic.c` file in the `net/sched` directory. It introduces a change in the behavior of handling the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag.

The patch adds a condition `!(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE)` to the existing condition `if (dev->tx_queue_len)` in the `attach_one_default_qdisc` function. This change ensures that if the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set in the `priv_flags` field of the `net_device` structure, the `noqueue_qdisc` will be used as the default queue discipline instead of creating a default queue discipline using `qdisc_create_dflt`.

Similarly, the patch adds the same condition to the existing condition in the `attach_default_qdiscs` function. This ensures that if the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set, the `noqueue_qdisc` will be attached as the default queue discipline for all the transmit queues.

Overall, the patch allows the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag to be used as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero, indicating that the device should not have any queue discipline.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by two developers, Phil Sutter and Jesper Dangaard Brouer, which indicates that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

Based on the analysis and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code cleanup change. The patch removes redundant "break" statements after "goto" statements in the max77686_clk_probe() function in drivers/clk/clk-max77686.c.

Since the "break" statements are indeed redundant in this context, removing them does not introduce any functional changes or potential issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered safe and can be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

My decision is (A) ACK - this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the r8712u driver in the Linux kernel. It fixes two instances where memory allocations are not checked for failure.

In the first instance, the patch adds a check for failure after the dev_alloc_skb() call. If the allocation fails, the patch breaks out of the loop, indicating a failure.

In the second instance, the patch adds a check for failure after the skb_clone() call. If the clone fails, the patch returns _FAIL, indicating a failure.

These checks ensure that if the memory allocations fail, the appropriate actions are taken to handle the failure gracefully.

Overall, the patch improves the robustness of the driver by properly handling memory allocation failures. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it is clear that the function `hp_amp_power_on` is only used within the `rt5640.c` file. The patch suggests making this function static by adding the `static` keyword to its declaration.

Considering that the function is not used outside of the file, making it static is a good practice as it limits the scope of the function to the file it is defined in. This helps in reducing namespace pollution and improves code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

This change is made to ensure uniformity and compatibility with device tree (DT) usage.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues, I would recommend accepting this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the check for `dst == NULL` in the `ip6t_SYNPROXY` module is unnecessary. The patch suggests removing this check and only checking `dst->error` instead. 

Since `ip6_route_output()` will never return a NULL pointer, the check for `dst == NULL` is redundant. Therefore, it is safe to remove this check from the code.

Considering this analysis, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch updates the clocksource driver for the sh_tmu hardware to use the clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers, which are now exported. This is a good practice as it ensures the driver is using the recommended APIs.

2. The patch removes the TODO comment related to calculating the shift from the rate and counter bit width. This suggests that the necessary calculations have been implemented or are no longer required.

3. The clockevents_config() function is called with the clock event device (ced) and the rate value from the sh_tmu_priv structure. This configures the clock event device with the provided rate.

4. The clockevents_config_and_register() function is called with the clock event device (ced), the broadcast flag set to 1, the min_delta_ns value set to 0x300, and the max_delta_ns value set to 0xffffffff. This configures and registers the clock event device with the provided parameters.

5. The patch also includes a dev_info() call to indicate that the sh_tmu hardware is being used for clock events.

Overall, the patch appears to improve the clocksource driver by using the recommended APIs and properly configuring the clock event device. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is modifying the drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16209_trigger.c and drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16240_trigger.c files. The patch replaces the existing event handler functions adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll() and adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll() with the iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function.

The iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function is a generic function provided by the IIO (Industrial I/O) framework for handling data ready triggers. It is a recommended approach for handling data ready triggers in IIO drivers.

Considering this information, it seems that the patch is improving the code by using a standardized function for handling data ready triggers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the variable "npend" is not initialized before being used in the function "ath9k_has_tx_pending". This issue was identified by a warning during compilation.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is recommended because the driver-core now supports synchronous self-deletion of attributes, and the asynchronous removal mechanism is scheduled for removal. Using `device_remove_file_self()` makes the "delete" behavior synchronous, which is desired.

2. The patch removes the `sdev_store_delete_callback()` function, which was previously used as a callback for `device_schedule_callback()`. This function is no longer needed with the new approach.

3. The `sdev_store_delete()` function is modified to use `device_remove_file_self()` instead of `device_schedule_callback()`. If `device_remove_file_self()` is successful, it proceeds to call `scsi_remove_device()` to remove the SCSI device.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary callback functions and replaces the asynchronous removal mechanism with a synchronous one. This change aligns with the direction of the driver-core and improves the behavior of the "delete" operation.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue where a recovery may be queued during boot, even though recursive recovery is avoided during shutdown. This can lead to a kernel panic when the recovery work tries to stop an already stopped hardware.

The fix verifies that the wl->state is on before queuing a new recovery. If the state is on, the patch sets the recovery in progress flag and changes the state to restarting. It then proceeds to disable interrupts and queues the recovery work.

This patch ensures that a recovery is only queued when the state is on, preventing the potential kernel panic. It is a targeted fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality or risk.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0` driver in the AMDGPU DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `ip_block_status` accordingly.

Considering the purpose of the patch and the fact that it is adding a new function without modifying any existing code, it seems to be a reasonable addition. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a constification patch, which aims to make the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers const. This patch is intended to improve code quality and prevent accidental modification of these variables.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the wacom_raw_event function in the hid-wacom.c file. The purpose of the patch is to move the check for the Graphire report header to a more appropriate location. The comment in the patch states that the check is valid only for Wacom Graphire devices, as their reports always start with 0x03. However, Intuos4 WL high-speed reports begin with 0x04, so the check would incorrectly filter out valid reports.

The patch introduces an if-else statement to handle the different product IDs. For the USB_DEVICE_ID_WACOM_GRAPHIRE_BLUETOOTH case, the patch checks if the report header is 0x03 before calling the wacom_gr_parse_report function. If the report header is not 0x03, it logs an error message and returns 0.

This change ensures that valid reports from Intuos4 WL high-speed devices are not filtered out incorrectly. It improves the accuracy of report handling for different Wacom devices.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Ping Cheng <pingc@wacom.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a Wacom developer.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that optimizes the error handling code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a crash issue in the acpi_power_meter driver. Currently, the driver crashes the kernel if it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. The patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, which allows the kernel to issue a warning message instead of crashing.

By replacing the BUG() macro with WARN(), the patch ensures that the unexpected conditions are handled gracefully without causing a kernel crash. This is a safer and more stable approach.

Additionally, the patch includes informative warning messages that indicate the specific error conditions encountered. This helps in identifying and debugging any potential issues in the code.

Overall, the patch improves the stability of the acpi_power_meter driver by preventing unnecessary kernel crashes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The primary plane's "crtc" and "state->crtc" pointers are updated to point to the "intel_crtc->base" object. This ensures that the plane is associated with the correct CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller).

3. The state of the primary plane's framebuffer is updated using the "update_state_fb" function.

4. The "plane_mask" of the "intel_crtc->base.state" is updated to include the primary plane using the "drm_plane_index" function.

5. In the "intel_modeset_gem_init" function, the primary plane's "crtc" and "state->crtc" pointers are set to NULL, indicating that the plane is not associated with any CRTC.

6. The state of the primary plane's framebuffer is updated again using the "update_state_fb" function.

7. The "plane_mask" of the "c->state" is updated to exclude the primary plane using the "drm_plane_index" function.

Overall, the patch appears to address issues related to plane state initialization and updates. It ensures that the plane_mask is accurate and properly updated during initialization and when the plane is not associated with any CRTC. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the duplicated callback functions in the codec driver and component driver are being addressed.

In the `mac802154_slave_open` function, the patch replaces the increment of `open_count` with a check if it is zero. If `open_count` is zero, it calls `drv_start(local)` and increments `open_count`. This change ensures that `drv_start(local)` is only called once when `open_count` transitions from zero to one.

In the `mac802154_slave_close` function, the patch decrements `open_count` before calling `drv_stop(local)`. It also changes the condition for calling `drv_stop(local)` to check if `open_count` is zero. This ensures that `drv_stop(local)` is only called once when `open_count` transitions from one to zero.

Overall, the patch simplifies the handling of `open_count` and ensures that the driver start and stop functions are called correctly. It does not introduce any new issues or risks.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it introduces a new member without modifying existing code, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to change the driver registration order for the comedi driver type "das08_cs". Currently, the pcmcia_driver is registered first, followed by the comedi_driver. The patch suggests registering the comedi_driver first, similar to other comedi driver types.

The patch starts by replacing the call to "pcmcia_register_driver" with "comedi_driver_register" for the "driver_das08_cs". This change ensures that the comedi_driver is registered before the pcmcia_driver.

Next, the patch adds a check for the success of the pcmcia_driver registration. If the registration fails, the comedi_driver is unregistered using "comedi_driver_unregister" and the error code is returned.

Finally, the patch returns 0 if both driver registrations succeed.

Overall, this patch improves the driver registration order and handles the case where the pcmcia_driver registration fails. It appears to be a reasonable change that should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch computes the struct net from the input device in ip_forward before it is used. This ensures that the correct network namespace is used for further operations.

2. The patch introduces a new variable `net` of type `struct net` to store the computed network namespace.

3. The `skb_forward_csum()` function is called to update the checksum of the forwarded packet.

4. The patch decreases the TTL field of the IP header as required by the RFC.

5. The patch increments the IP statistics counter `IPSTATS_MIB_FRAGFAILS` using the `IP_INC_STATS()` macro, passing the `net` variable as the network namespace.

6. The patch sends an ICMP message if the packet exceeds the MTU, indicating that fragmentation is needed.

7. The patch increments the IP statistics counter `IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS` using the `IP_INC_STATS_BH()` macro, passing the `net` variable as the network namespace.

8. Finally, the patch frees the sk_buff using `kfree_skb()`.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to the ip_forward function, ensuring the correct network namespace is used and updating the IP statistics counters correctly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the function `CsrUInt16ToHex` from `csr_util.c` to `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`. This indicates that the function is only used in `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`, making it more appropriate to be located there.

2. The patch also updates the function declaration in `csr_util.h` to remove the declaration of `CsrUInt16ToHex`. This ensures that the function is no longer accessible outside of `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`, which is consistent with its usage.

3. The function `CsrUInt16ToHex` itself is modified to be static, meaning it can only be accessed within the same translation unit (source file). This further restricts its usage to `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c` only.

4. The patch includes the necessary authorship and licensing information.

Overall, the patch improves code organization and encapsulation by moving the function to the appropriate file and limiting its visibility. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the btrfs filesystem in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the btrfs_add_nondir function to take btrfs_inode instead of the generic inode structure. It also updates the function calls to pass the appropriate btrfs_inode pointers.

Considering that this patch is a bug fix and does not introduce any new functionality, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a definition for the MAC_SM_RST register value, which represents the reset bit of the MAC status machine register. This is a clear and necessary addition to improve code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch updates the code to use the newly defined MAC_SM_RST value when resetting the internal state machine in two places: r6040_init_mac_regs() and r6040_mac_address(). This change ensures consistency and clarity in the code.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only improves the code by using a defined constant instead of a hardcoded value.

Overall, the patch is straightforward, improves code readability, and does not introduce any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Additionally, the patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Antti Palosaari, Hans Verkuil, and Mauro Carvalho Chehab, which indicates that it has undergone review and testing.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch removes redundant assignments of the "ret" variable in the functions pca953x_write_single, pca953x_gpio_direction_input, pca953x_gpio_direction_output, and pca953x_remove. These assignments are unnecessary since the "ret" variable is updated later in the code. Removing them improves code readability and reduces redundancy.

2. The patch corrects the indentation of the constant definition for PCA_PCAL, aligning it with the other constants in the file.

3. The patch removes one empty line, which helps maintain consistent code formatting.

Overall, the changes made by the patch are minor and improve code readability without introducing any functional changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The workqueue "wq" is used to queue work items that map to `alias_guid_work`. The patch updates the initialization of the workqueue to use `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` instead of the deprecated function.

3. The `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM` flag is set to ensure forward progress under memory pressure. This indicates that the patch takes memory management into consideration.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs and has been reviewed by relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch appears to be a necessary update to replace a deprecated function and improve memory management. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a bug fix for the perf probe feature. It addresses an issue where resources related to a perf probe event were not being freed properly in the cleanup_perf_probe_events() function.

The patch adds a call to clear_perf_probe_event() to ensure that resources for perf probe events are also freed. This fix seems reasonable and necessary to prevent potential resource leaks.

Considering the Acked-by tags from reputable contributors and the reported-by tag, it suggests that the patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a necessary change to add the `dma_dir` parameter to the `alloc` function in the `vb2_mem_ops` structure. This change allows the `dma-sg` alloc memop to know the `dma_dir`, which is required for a subsequent patch.

Considering the importance of maintaining stability in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) and including it in the Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds additional information about the registered framebuffer, similar to what is printed by efifb. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have agreed to the contribution and have the necessary rights to submit the patch.

3. The patch also includes an Acked-by tag from Stephen Warren, indicating that he has reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch includes a Cc tag to David Herrmann, suggesting that he is being notified of the patch for his awareness.

5. The added code in the patch prints information about the framebuffer, such as its memory address, size, mapping, format, mode, and line length. This information can be helpful for developers and users to understand the characteristics of the framebuffer.

6. The patch registers the framebuffer and handles any potential errors during the registration process.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward addition that provides useful information and does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch removes the call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The reason for this change is that the IRQ is allocated using `devm_request_irq`. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Is the removal of `free_irq` justified? If the IRQ is indeed allocated using `devm_request_irq`, then it is not necessary to explicitly free the IRQ using `free_irq`. This is because `devm_request_irq` automatically handles the freeing of the IRQ when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded. If this is the case, then the removal of `free_irq` is justified.

2. Does the patch introduce any new issues or regressions? Removing `free_irq` could potentially introduce issues if there are other parts of the code that rely on `free_irq` being called explicitly. It is important to ensure that the removal of `free_irq` does not cause any unintended side effects or break any existing functionality.

3. Is the patch properly tested? It is crucial to verify that the patch has been thoroughly tested to ensure that it does not introduce any new bugs or regressions. This includes testing on different hardware configurations and scenarios.

Based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, without further details or analysis, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. A more thorough review of the code and testing would be necessary to provide a more accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with wrong checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The current implementation compares the obtained value directly with the target value, which is incorrect because AC_VERB_GET_POWER_STATE returns the combined bits of the actual state and the target state.

The patch introduces the necessary modifications to properly shift and mask the obtained value before comparing it with the target value. It first reads the power state using snd_hda_codec_read and then applies the necessary bit shifting and masking operations to obtain the actual state. Finally, it compares the actual state with the target value and takes appropriate action.

The modifications are made in two functions: update_power_state and update_conv_power_state. In both cases, the same incorrect comparison is fixed using the same approach.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue in the code and provides a correct solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds variable resolution support to the gspca driver by allowing subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions. This is a valuable enhancement that improves the functionality of the driver.

2. The patch modifies the try_fmt_vid_cap function to pass the original resolution to the subdriver try_fmt function. This ensures that the subdriver can modify the format parameters if needed.

3. The vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function is modified to handle the case when the subdriver has a try_fmt function. If the subdriver has a try_fmt function, the format parameters are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the format parameters remain unchanged.

4. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function is modified to call the subdriver's enum_framesizes function if it exists. This allows the subdriver to provide custom frame size enumeration.

5. The patch also adds two new function pointers (try_fmt and enum_framesizes) to the sd_desc structure, which are used by the subdrivers to implement the variable resolution support.

Overall, the patch introduces valuable functionality and maintains backward compatibility. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, the changes involve removing the __dev* attributes in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are used for hotplug support, which is being removed as an option in the kernel configuration.

The patch removes the __devinit, __devexit_p, __devinitdata, __devinitconst, and __devexit attributes from various functions in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are used to mark functions that are only used during device initialization or removal.

Since hotplug support is being removed and these attributes are no longer necessary, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a local variable called "scanned_queue" to the function "rtw_createbss_cmd23a_callback". This local variable is a pointer to the "scanned_queue" member of the "mlmepriv" structure.

2. The patch replaces five references to "pmlmepriv->scanned_queue" with the new local variable "scanned_queue". This simplifies the code and improves readability.

3. The patch also fixes a checkpatch.pl warning about a line exceeding 80 characters by splitting the long line into multiple lines.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the changes introduced by the patch are straightforward and improve code readability without introducing any functional changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the `enum dio200_layout` to `enum dio200_layout_idx`. This change is a simple renaming and does not introduce any functional changes.

2. The comment in the patch states that the `enum dio200_layout` is only used once and renaming it frees up the `dio200_layout` tag for future use. This suggests that the renaming is done to improve code organization and potentially allow for future enhancements.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ian Abbott and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change is limited to the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c` file, which suggests that it is specific to the amplc_dio200 driver and does not have broader implications.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a reasonable and non-disruptive change that improves code organization. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. This enhancement improves the information displayed for imported USB devices.

2. The patch initializes the names database by calling the `usbip_names_init()` function with the `USBIDS_FILE` parameter. If the initialization fails, an error message is printed.

3. The patch opens the `vhci_driver` and checks if it was successfully opened. If the driver fails to open, an error message is printed, and the patch jumps to the `err_names_free` label to free the names database and return -1.

4. The patch then proceeds to list the imported USB devices by iterating over the `idev` array. If the `usbip_vhci_imported_device_dump()` function fails for any device, the patch jumps to the `err_driver_close` label to close the driver and free the names database before returning -1.

5. After listing the imported USB devices, the patch closes the `vhci_driver` and frees the names database by calling `usbip_vhci_driver_close()` and `usbip_names_free()` functions, respectively.

6. Finally, the patch returns the value of `ret`, which indicates the success or failure of listing the imported devices.

Overall, the patch adds functionality to display vendor names for imported USB devices, improves error handling, and ensures proper cleanup. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix and improvement for the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements a rate_update hook in the rs (rate scaling) module of the iwlwifi driver. It re-initializes the rate scaling when a rate_update hook is called, which occurs when a remote STA changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

The patch includes changes in the mac80211.c, rs.c, and rs.h files of the iwlwifi driver. It introduces a new function, rs_rate_update, which is called when a rate_update hook is triggered. This function stops ongoing aggregations, initializes rate scaling for the STA, and updates the rate control operations structure.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific issue related to rate scaling and improves the functionality of the iwlwifi driver.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a straightforward code improvement. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma" in the "vb2_vmalloc_put_userptr" function. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by multiple developers.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality from the code. The comment in the patch states that the SYSRESET bits in the HDMI PLL do not actually reset the PLL itself but only affect the power used for the PLL. Since there is no reason to use the SYSRESET bits and they are not used in other PLLs, the patch suggests removing the HDMI PLL reset to simplify the code and make it similar to other PLLs.

The patch removes the `hdmi_pll_reset` function, which was responsible for controlling the SYSRESET bits and waiting for the reset to complete. The function is no longer called in the `hdmi_pll_enable` function.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the HDMI PLL reset functionality is unnecessary and removing it simplifies the code. As long as the patch has been tested and does not introduce any regressions or issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough review, including testing and consideration of potential side effects, is recommended before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `reconnect_one()` in the file `fs/exportfs/expfs.c`. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a filesystem operation.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. The `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function is similar to `lookup_one_len()`, but it performs the lookup without acquiring the inode lock on the parent directory. This change is made to improve performance and reduce contention on the inode lock.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp != dentry`). In this case, the comment explains that the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. The comment states that if the dentry has been renamed, it must have been looked up and connected, and it will remain connected afterwards. Therefore, the function can simply skip the reconnection process and proceed to the `out_reconnected` label.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable optimization that improves performance and handles the case of a renamed dentry correctly. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix that ensures the vm_struct has its phys_addr member filled in for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Considering the Acked-by tag from Nicolas Pitre and the Signed-off-by tag from Russell King, both respected contributors in the Linux kernel community, it suggests that the patch has undergone review and testing.

Given the nature of the patch and the positive feedback from the reviewers, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces NULL values returned by `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it provides more specific error information.

2. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` when too many instances of the audio service are initialized. This is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in handling the error gracefully.

3. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)` when `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory. Again, this is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in proper error handling.

4. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EPERM)` when VCHI connections fail to open. This is another valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in handling the error appropriately.

5. The patch replaces a NULL check with `IS_ERR(..)` where `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is called. This change ensures that the error pointer is properly checked and handled.

Overall, the patch improves error handling and provides more specific error information. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

The removal of unused code is generally considered a good practice as it reduces code complexity and improves maintainability. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch suggests using an enum for DRM_MINOR_* constants instead of hard-coding the IDs. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The addition of DRM_MINOR_CNT allows for range-checks in follow-up code, which can help prevent potential issues.

3. The IDs of the minor-types are changed by -1, but since they are not used as indices, this change does not introduce any problems.

4. The patch includes a Signed-off-by line, indicating that the author has agreed to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) and certifies the patch's origin.

5. The patch has been reviewed by Daniel Vetter and includes the reviewed-by line, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

Overall, the patch seems to be well-structured and addresses the mentioned improvements. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `ur_set_online` function in the `vmur.c` file of the `s390` driver. The purpose of the patch is to link the parent CCW device during UR device creation.

The specific change made by the patch is in the `device_create` function call. Previously, the `device_create` function was called with `NULL` as the second argument, which represents the parent device. The patch modifies this argument to `&cdev->dev`, which specifies the parent CCW device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is making a necessary and reasonable change to link the parent CCW device during UR device creation. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes redundant code in the bnx2x_init_dev() function. The code sets the device power state to D0, but this is already done by the Pci_enable_device() function. Therefore, the redundant power state set can be safely removed.

2. The patch also removes redundant code for finding the power management capability (PM Cap) of the PCI device. The pci_find_capability() function is replaced with pdev->pm_cap, which retrieves the saved PM Cap value from the pci core. This change simplifies the code and eliminates the need for redundant searching.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only removes redundant code, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Yuval Mintz from Broadcom, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a relevant party.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command. This option allows explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. This addition enhances the functionality of the "perf record" tool.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "builtin-record.c" file to handle the new option. It adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the list of available options and sets the "record.opts.sample_cpu" flag accordingly.

3. The patch also updates the "perf.h" file to include the "sample_cpu" flag in the "record_opts" structure.

4. In the "evsel.c" file, the patch modifies the "perf_evsel__config" function to check if the target has a CPU or if the "sample_cpu" flag is set. If either condition is true, the CPU sample bit is set for the event selector.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-implemented and adds a useful feature to the "perf record" tool without introducing any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the `dm_thin_find_block()` function of the `dm-thin-metadata.c` file. The issue is that the `->fail_io` flag is checked outside the `metadata` device's `root_lock`, which can lead to a race condition with the setting of this flag.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for `pmd->fail_io` inside the `root_lock` section. If `pmd->fail_io` is true, the function returns `-EINVAL` and releases the `root_lock` before doing so.

This fix ensures that the `dm_thin_find_block()` function is properly synchronized with the setting of the `fail_io` flag, preventing any potential race conditions.

Given that the patch addresses a race condition and provides a clear and concise fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning related to NOHZ local_softirq_pending. This indicates that the patch addresses a known issue and aims to resolve it.

2. The patch replaces the usage of netif_rx() with netif_rx_ni(). The latter function is specifically designed to be used from process/softirq context. This change ensures that the correct function is used in the appropriate context, which improves code correctness and stability.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the dp83640.c file, specifically in the rx_timestamp_work() function. This minimizes the potential impact on other parts of the kernel.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for the reported warning and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple addition of MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. The MODULE_ALIAS macro is used to provide an alias for a module, allowing it to be loaded using the alias name instead of the full module name.

In this case, the patch is adding the MODULE_ALIAS("platform:aat2870-regulator") line, which means that the module can be loaded using the alias "platform:aat2870-regulator". This can be useful for cases where the module name is long or complex, providing a more user-friendly way to load the module.

Since this patch is a simple addition and does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing code, it can be considered a safe change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds debug error messages to report command timeout in the `lio_process_ordered_list()` function. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and identifying issues related to command timeouts.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the `if_cfg_callback()` function. This provides additional information about the failure status, which can aid in diagnosing and resolving issues related to network interface configuration.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes are specific to the `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c` and `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/response_manager.c` files, which suggests that they are targeted and relevant to the specific functionality provided by the Cavium LiquidIO network driver.

Overall, the patch appears to improve error reporting and debugging capabilities in the Cavium LiquidIO network driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a straightforward change that removes the use of the of_match_ptr() function in the tegra-usb driver. The rationale behind this change is that the data structure protected by of_match_ptr() is always compiled in, making the function unnecessary.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It seems to be a simple and safe change that removes redundant code. However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and verification, should be conducted before finalizing the decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to tidy up the ni_stc.h header file in the staging/comedi directory.
2. It renames the CamelCase and converts enums into defines, which improves code readability and maintainability.
3. The patch uses the BIT() macro to define the bits, which is a common practice in the Linux kernel.
4. The patch modifies the ni_cdio_cmdtest() function by replacing the CR_PACK_FLAGS() macro with NI_M_CDO_MODE_SAMPLE_SRC_MASK, improving clarity and consistency.
5. The patch modifies the ni_cdio_cmd() function by replacing the CDO_* macros with NI_M_CDO_MODE_* defines, making the code more readable and reducing the reliance on magic numbers.
6. The patch adds new defines to the ni_stc.h header file, which provide more descriptive names for the various bits and masks used in the code.

Overall, the patch improves code readability, maintainability, and consistency. It also introduces new defines that enhance the understanding of the code. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it is clear that the patch is introducing the use of the "const" keyword to make the of_device_id arrays read-only. This change is consistent with the usage of of_device_id arrays in other parts of the Linux kernel codebase.

Considering that of_device_id arrays are always used as const and that this patch is making the necessary changes to ensure const correctness, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

The patch modifies the `whitelist` array in the `intel_uncore.c` file of the i915 driver. Specifically, it changes the `gen_bitmask` value for the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` entry from `GEN_RANGE(4, 8)` to `GEN_RANGE(4, 9)`.

Based on this change, it appears that the patch is updating the supported generations for the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` register. The original value limited the supported generations to 4 to 8, while the updated value extends the support to 4 to 9.

Considering that the patch is modifying the whitelist to include an additional supported generation, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function in the `drm/nouveau/abi16` module. This locked variant is necessary for providing limited interoperability in USIF.

2. The existing `nouveau_abi16_get()` function is modified to be a static function called `nouveau_abi16()`. This function is responsible for allocating and initializing the `abi16` structure if it doesn't exist.

3. The `nouveau_abi16_get()` function is then modified to acquire the client mutex before calling `nouveau_abi16()`. If `nouveau_abi16()` returns a non-NULL value, it means the `abi16` structure was successfully initialized, and the function returns `cli->abi16`. Otherwise, it returns NULL.

4. The `nouveau_abi16_put()` function is not modified in this patch.

Overall, this patch introduces a necessary locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function, ensuring proper synchronization when accessing the ABI16 data. It does not modify any existing functionality or introduce any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the behavior to not overwrite csma settings when setting the channel afterwards. This indicates that there was a bug or unintended behavior in the previous code, and the patch aims to correct it.

2. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Stefan Schmidt, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review and has been approved by a trusted contributor.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, Alexander Aring and Marcel Holtmann, indicating that they take responsibility for the code changes.

4. The code changes in the patch are straightforward and appear to address the issue directly. The previous code explicitly set the CCA mode to 0, which may not be desirable in all cases. The patch replaces this with a call to atusb_write_subreg(), which seems to be a more appropriate function for setting the channel.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch adds the missing helper function `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to the `crypto/ahash` module. This function returns the block size of an ahash algorithm. The patch also includes the necessary documentation for the new function.

Adding this helper function is beneficial as it provides a convenient way to obtain the block size for a message digest cipher. It enhances the functionality and usability of the `crypto/ahash` module.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `fib_table_lookup` function in the `net/ipv4/fib_trie.c` file. The purpose of the patch is to improve performance by using the `__fls()` function instead of the `fls()` function when calculating the value of `mp`.

The comment in the patch explains that `fls(x) = __fls(x) + 1`. This means that `__fls()` is faster than `fls()` when we know that the argument `x` is non-null.

The patch replaces the line `int mp = KEYLENGTH - fls(pref_mismatch);` with `int mp = KEYLENGTH - __fls(pref_mismatch) - 1;`. This change ensures that the calculation of `mp` is correct based on the relationship between `fls()` and `__fls()`.

Overall, the patch seems to be a performance improvement without introducing any functional changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the issue it addresses.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a signature mismatch in the function `regulator_get_error_flags()` when `CONFIG_REGULATOR` is not defined. This ensures that both declarations match, preventing compiler errors.

2. The patch adds an additional parameter `unsigned int *flags` to the function `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This parameter is not used in the function implementation, but it matches the signature of the non-inline version of the function.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch addresses a signature mismatch issue and ensures consistency in the function declarations. It does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. Therefore, it can be considered a safe and necessary fix for maintaining code correctness.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the libceph module and makes changes in multiple files: fs/ceph/addr.c, fs/ceph/file.c, and net/ceph/osd_client.c. The changes involve deferring the building of the osd request until just before submitting it in all callers except ceph_writepages_start().

In each file, the patch removes the ceph_osdc_build_request() call from the start_read(), ceph_sync_write(), ceph_osdc_readpages(), and ceph_osdc_writepages() functions. Instead, it moves the ceph_osdc_build_request() call after some other operations.

The patch also adds a comment and a BUG_ON() statement in the ceph_sync_write() function, which is commented out.

Overall, the patch seems to be aimed at improving the efficiency and correctness of building osd requests in the libceph module. It appears to be a reasonable change that can be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not take into account any potential dependencies or conflicts with other patches or code in the Linux kernel. A more comprehensive analysis would require a deeper understanding of the codebase and its context.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake processors to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. The patch modifies the intel_pstate_cpu_ids table to include the INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_GEMINI_LAKE entry, which uses the same functions as the INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_GOLDMONT entry.

Considering that the patch adds support for a new processor family, it is likely that it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis is required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new advertising setting called "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" to the Bluetooth subsystem. This setting allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting.

2. The patch modifies the "enable_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" to handle the new advertising setting. If the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set, the controller is switched to connectable mode. Otherwise, the existing "get_connectable" function is used to determine the connectable mode.

3. The "set_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" is also modified to handle the new advertising setting. If the "cp->val" (value) is 0x02, the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set. If it is 0x00 or 0x01, the flag is cleared. This ensures that the advertising mode is correctly set based on the provided value.

4. The patch includes proper error handling and response sending to user space.

Overall, the patch adds a useful feature to the Bluetooth subsystem by allowing independent control of the connectable mode during advertising. It appears to be well-implemented and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch updates the code in the comedi_test.c file in the staging directory of the Linux kernel.

2. The patch introduces the use of the comedi_fc helper function `cfc_check_trigger_arg_is()` to validate the trigger arguments when the source is TRIG_TIMER.

3. The local variable `tmp` is changed to an unsigned int and renamed to `arg` for aesthetic reasons.

4. The patch modifies the code in the `waveform_ai_cmdtest()` function.

5. In the code block where `cmd->scan_begin_src` is TRIG_TIMER, the patch replaces the calculation of `cmd->scan_begin_arg` with the `arg` variable. It also applies rounding to the nearest microsecond.

6. The patch then checks if `cmd->scan_begin_arg` is different from the original value `tmp` and increments the `err` variable accordingly. Additionally, it calls `cfc_check_trigger_arg_is()` to validate the argument.

7. The same modifications are applied to the `cmd->convert_src` block.

8. Finally, the `err` variable is checked.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the validation of trigger arguments when the source is TRIG_TIMER. It also introduces the use of the `cfc_check_trigger_arg_is()` helper function, which enhances the code's readability and maintainability.

5. The patch modifies the "net2280_enable" function by calling "ep_clear_seqnum" if the device's quirks include PLX_SUPERSPEED.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to sequence number synchronization and has undergone testing and review. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a migration of the Jazz driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by the clockevents core. The earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked as obsolete.

The patch also mentions enabling callbacks for new states of clockevent devices, such as ONESHOT_STOPPED. However, it states that there were no actions performed in the previous 'set-mode' callback, so this patch does not provide any set-state callbacks.

Considering this information, it appears that the patch is mainly a migration to the new interface without any additional functionality. Therefore, it can be considered a clean-up or maintenance patch rather than a bug fix or feature addition.

Given that stable releases typically focus on bug fixes and critical updates, this patch may not be necessary for inclusion in stable releases. However, it could be suitable for inclusion in the mainline kernel.

Therefore, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. This means that the function is only accessible within the same translation unit (source file). Declaring it as static helps to encapsulate the function and prevent it from being accessed or modified from other files, improving code maintainability and reducing potential bugs.

2. The patch includes the necessary "Signed-off-by" tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the authors.

3. The patch modifies the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" by changing its visibility from global to static. This change ensures that the function is only used within the same file, reducing the risk of unintended usage or conflicts with other parts of the codebase.

4. The patch removes the comment stating that the function is called under j_list_lock, but the journal may not be locked. This suggests that the comment was either incorrect or no longer applicable. However, since the code change itself is unrelated to this comment, it does not affect the decision to accept the patch.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable and beneficial change, improving code encapsulation and reducing potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

2. The off-by-one error occurs in the condition `if (i < O2CB_MAP_STABILIZE_COUNT)`. The patch corrects it by subtracting 1 from O2CB_MAP_STABILIZE_COUNT.

3. The purpose of the condition is to avoid an unnecessary delay (msleep) on the final loop iteration. By fixing the off-by-one error, the delay will be skipped on the last iteration.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Daeseok Youn, Mark Fasheh, Joel Becker, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the off-by-one error and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch simplifies the boolean test by replacing "if (override_serial == 0)" with "if (!override_serial)". This change improves code readability and reduces mental parsing effort. It also aligns with the recommended coding style for boolean tests in the Linux kernel.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. It only simplifies the existing code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

Therefore, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

However, it is still worth fixing.

Therefore, the patch improves the correctness of the code and does not introduce any new issues. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds warnings for unresolved control methods in the ACPICA disassembler. It introduces new variables `acpi_gbl_num_external_methods` and `acpi_gbl_resolved_external_methods` to track the number of external methods and resolved external methods, respectively.

Without further context or details about the purpose and impact of these changes, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to consider this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The addition of warnings for unresolved control methods can help identify potential issues and improve the overall stability of the kernel.

Please note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and consideration of potential side effects, would be necessary before making a final decision.

false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: prevent get_user_pages recursion" and it aims to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages() function by ignoring MMU callbacks from within the function.

The patch introduces a new structure called "amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list" which contains a list_head and a task_struct pointer. This structure is used to keep track of tasks inside the get_user_pages() function and ignore MMU callbacks from there.

In the "amdgpu_ttm_tt" structure, two new members are added: "guptasklock" of type spinlock_t and "guptasks" of type list_head. These members are used to synchronize access to the list of tasks inside the get_user_pages() function.

In the "amdgpu_ttm_tt_pin_userptr" function, a new "guptask" variable of type "amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list" is declared and initialized with the current task. The "guptask" is then added to the "guptasks" list using spin_lock() and list_add(). After calling get_user_pages(), the "guptask" is removed from the list using spin_lock() and list_del().

In the "amdgpu_ttm_tt_affect_userptr" function, a new "entry" variable of type "amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list" is declared. The function iterates over the "guptasks" list using list_for_each_entry() and checks if the current task matches any task in the list. If a match is found, it means that recursion is occurring, and the function returns false.

Overall, this patch introduces the necessary changes to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages() function by keeping track of tasks and ignoring MMU callbacks. It appears to be a valid and necessary fix, and therefore, I recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch removes the duplicated "const" keyword from the declaration of the variable "list" at line 435.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

4. The change itself is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a warning and does not introduce any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to make the VLAN deletion function symmetric with the VLAN addition function in the mlxsw spectrum driver. Previously, the __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() function was removed from the driver's init sequence, causing it to be non-symmetric.

The patch reintroduces the __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() function and places it after the necessary operations. It first checks if the port is bridged and returns an error if it is not. Then, it sets the port's PVID (Port VLAN ID) to 0 if it falls within the range of the VLANs being deleted. After that, it removes the VLANs from the port using the __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_set() function. Finally, it performs additional operations related to the VLAN deletion.

The patch ensures that the VLAN deletion function is symmetric with the VLAN addition function, which improves the overall consistency and maintainability of the mlxsw spectrum driver.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch changes the type of `tx_buf` from `const u16*` to `const u8*`.
2. It introduces a new variable `data` of type `u16` and initializes it to 0.
3. It checks if `msg->tx_len` is greater than 0 and if so, it sets the lower 8 bits of `data` to `tx_buf[0]`.
4. It checks if `msg->tx_len` is greater than 1 and if so, it sets the upper 8 bits of `data` to `tx_buf[1]` shifted left by 8 bits.
5. It constructs the value `val` by combining `data` and `msg->type` using the `GEN_HDATA` and `GEN_HTYPE` macros.
6. It calls the `dw_mipi_dsi_gen_pkt_hdr_write` function with `dsi` and `val` as arguments.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch aims to avoid an out-of-bounds read on `tx_buf` and explicitly encode the endianness of the data. The changes made seem reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

6. The "dev" variable is assigned the value of skb->dev, which is the network device associated with the received packet.

7. The patch replaces the usage of "skb->dev" with "dev" in the call to __inet_lookup_established function.

8. The __inet_lookup_established function is used to find an established TCP socket matching the source and destination IP addresses and ports.

9. The patch also replaces the usage of "skb->dev" with "dev" in the call to skb_dst_set_noref function.

10. The skb_dst_set_noref function is used to set the destination cache of the socket buffer.

11. Before setting the destination cache, the patch checks if the route's input interface index (rt_iif) matches the index of the network device (dev->ifindex).

12. If the indices match, the patch sets the destination cache and sets the error code to 0.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It adds a validation check to prevent potential violations of reverse path filtering, and the changes appear to be correct and well-implemented.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Since this patch is a simple fix and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions, it can be considered a safe and appropriate change for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to ensure that the DAPM widget IO operations hold the component mutex. This is achieved by introducing two new inline functions, `soc_widget_lock` and `soc_widget_unlock`, and modifying the existing `soc_widget_update_bits` function to use the new lock and unlock functions.

Considering the purpose of the patch and the changes made, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch ensures proper synchronization by acquiring and releasing the component mutex when performing DAPM widget IO operations. This can help prevent potential race conditions and ensure the correct behavior of the DAPM subsystem.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

This check ensures that the platform data is properly initialized before proceeding with the rest of the code.

2. The patch also includes an error message ("NULL platform data") to provide useful information in case the check fails. This helps with debugging and identifying the cause of the issue.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior significantly. It only adds a necessary check for NULL platform data, which improves the robustness of the code.

Overall, this patch seems to address a potential issue and improves the reliability of the ramoops driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid CamelCase naming convention.

2. In the `Handle_Scan` function, the assignment `hif_drv->strWILC_UsrScanReq.pfUserScanResult = pstrHostIFscanAttr->result;` replaces the usage of `pfScanResult` with `result`.

3. In the `host_int_scan` function, the assignment `msg.body.scan_info.pfScanResult = ScanResult;` is replaced with `msg.body.scan_info.result = ScanResult;`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch only renames the `pfScanResult` variable to `result` in multiple places. This change does not affect the functionality or behavior of the code. It is a cosmetic change to adhere to naming conventions.

Therefore, this patch is a cosmetic change and does not introduce any functional or behavioral modifications. It can be considered a low-risk change and can be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch fixes a regression with pnfs (Parallel NFS) support for direct I/O writes. It addresses an issue introduced by commit 57208fa7e51, which did not modify the calls in direct.c, preventing direct I/O from using pnfs. The patch reintroduces the capability by modifying the calls in direct.c.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it modifies two lines of code in the direct.c file. It replaces the call to `nfs_pageio_init_write` with `NFS_PROTO(dreq->inode)->write_pageio_init` in both instances.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch correctly addresses the regression and reintroduces the capability for pnfs support with direct I/O writes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros from the code. The comment states that these macros are "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscates the code." Removing these macros simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.

The patch also modifies a debug message in the rtw_cfg80211_add_monitor_if function. Previously, the debug message used the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros to print the name of the monitor interface. With the patch, the debug message directly uses the name field of the pwdev_priv->pmon_ndev structure.

Overall, the patch improves code readability by removing unnecessary macros and simplifying the debug message. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. Therefore, it is a safe and reasonable change to include in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses a potential issue where the parent socket (the bound one) could be freed before its children. In such cases, unlinking the children without trying to reach them through the parent is necessary.

The patch modifies the `llcp_sock_release` function in `net/nfc/llcp/sock.c`. It first acquires a lock on the `socket_lock` mutex. Then, it checks if the `llcp_sock` is equal to the socket stored in `local->sockets[llcp_sock->ssap]`. If they are equal, it sets `local->sockets[llcp_sock->ssap]` to `NULL`. This step ensures that the parent socket is correctly unlinked.

If the `llcp_sock` is not equal to the socket stored in `local->sockets[llcp_sock->ssap]`, it means that the `llcp_sock` is a child socket. In this case, the patch directly deletes the `llcp_sock` from the linked list using `list_del(&llcp_sock->list)`. This step unlinks the child socket from the parent's list.

Finally, the patch releases the lock on `socket_lock`.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of freeing the parent socket before its children and correctly unlinks the child sockets. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is a fix for the argument name of the `host_int_add_ptk` function in the `wilc1000` staging driver.

   - It states that in typical guest boot workload, only 2-3 memslots are extensively used, and the same memslot lookup operation is performed repeatedly.

2. Changes made by the patch:
   - A new member `lru_slot` of type `atomic_t` is added to the `struct kvm_memslots` to store the index of the most recently used memslot.
   - The `search_memslots` function is modified to utilize the LRU cache:
     - It first checks if the requested guest frame number (gfn) falls within the range of the memslot stored in the LRU cache. If so, it returns the memslot directly.
     - If not, it iterates over all memslots to find the appropriate one and updates the LRU cache with the index of the found memslot.

3. Benefits of the patch:
   - The patch claims to improve the average lookup time for the given workload from 46 to 28 cycles, which is approximately a 40% improvement.
   - By caching the most recently used memslot, the patch reduces the need for iterating over all memslots in most cases, resulting in faster lookup operations.

4. Code quality and impact analysis:
   - The patch introduces a simple and localized change, which appears to be well-implemented.
   - It does not modify any existing functionality or introduce any new risks or regressions.
   - The performance improvement is specific to the given workload and does not negatively impact other scenarios.

Considering the above analysis, the patch seems to provide a clear performance benefit without introducing any significant risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `kvmppc_core_check_requests` in multiple files (`arch/powerpc/include/asm/kvm_ppc.h`, `arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_pr.c`, `arch/powerpc/kvm/booke.c`, and `arch/powerpc/kvm/powerpc.c`). The function previously had a void return type and is modified to have an int return type.

The purpose of the patch is to add a return value to the `kvmppc_core_check_requests` function. This allows requests to indicate whether the system needs to go back into the host state or continue executing in the guest state.

The patch introduces a new local variable `r` in each modified function, which is set to 1 to indicate that the system should get back into the guest state. The return value of the function is then set to `r`.

The modification in each file is consistent and does not introduce any new issues or conflicts. The patch is relatively simple and does not appear to have any negative impact on the existing codebase.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch aims to improve debugging for critical host errors in the xHCI (USB 3.0) host controller driver. It adds additional error handling code to print out the contents of the Transfer Request Block (TRB) and the event ring when certain errors occur.

The added code helps provide more information about the error, allowing users to understand what went wrong without having to recompile the kernel. This can be particularly useful for debugging and troubleshooting USB-related issues.

The patch includes error handling for two scenarios: when the transfer event points to a bad slot and when the transfer event is for a disabled endpoint or an incorrect stream ring. In both cases, the patch prints out the relevant information and the event ring.

By providing this additional debugging information, the patch enhances the usability and troubleshooting capabilities of the xHCI driver. It does not introduce any new functionality or change existing behavior.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch removes a pointless cast in the `sha1_mb_mod_init()` function in `arch/x86/crypto/sha-mb/sha1_mb.c`. The cast is unnecessary because `kzalloc()` already returns a void pointer, so there is no need to explicitly cast it to `struct sha1_ctx_mgr *`.

By removing the cast, the code becomes cleaner and more readable. It also eliminates the potential for type-related issues or bugs caused by incorrect casting.

Therefore, I believe this patch is a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch adds a second parent option for the dbg_base_clk in the socfpga clock driver. It allows the debug base clock to be bypassed from the main PLL to the OSC1 clock. The bypass register is the staysoc1(0x10) register in the clock manager.

The patch modifies the clk_periclk_get_parent() function to read the clk_src value from the CLKMGR_DBCTRL register and return the appropriate parent for the debug base clock.

In the __socfpga_periph_init() function, the patch modifies the init.parent_names and init.num_parents fields to support multiple parent options for the debug base clock. It uses the of_clk_parent_fill() function to fill the parent_name array with the available parent names.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch adds a necessary feature to the socfpga clock driver by allowing the debug base clock to have multiple parent options. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is making a change in the rtl8192_pci_probe() function in the rtl_core.c file of the rtl8192e staging driver. It adds an if statement to check the return value of the register_netdev() function. If the return value is non-zero (indicating an error), it jumps to the err_free_irq label and returns -ENODEV.

This change is beneficial because it ensures that any error during the registration of the network device is properly handled. By returning -ENODEV, the driver can indicate to the caller that the device could not be registered, allowing for appropriate error handling.

Overall, this patch improves the robustness of the driver by handling potential errors during device registration. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch introduces two helper functions, `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser`, for accessing the ITS BASERn register. These functions provide a convenient way to read and write values to the register.

2. The `its_read_baser` function takes an `its_node` structure and a `struct its_baser` pointer as arguments. It calculates the index of the `baser` within the `its->tables` array and reads the corresponding value from the ITS BASERn register using `readq_relaxed`.

3. The `its_write_baser` function takes the same arguments as `its_read_baser` along with a `u64` value to be written. It calculates the index of the `baser` within the `its->tables` array and writes the value to the ITS BASERn register using `writeq_relaxed`. It also updates the `baser->val` field by calling `its_read_baser` after the write operation.

4. The patch modifies the `its_alloc_tables` function to use the new helper functions. Instead of directly reading and writing to the ITS BASERn register, it now calls `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser` to perform these operations.

5. The modifications in `its_alloc_tables` ensure that the `baser->val` field is correctly updated after writing to the ITS BASERn register. This is done by calling `its_write_baser_cache` (which should be `its_write_baser`) and then reading the updated value from `baser->val`.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of existing code. It only adds helper functions and updates the usage in `its_alloc_tables` to improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a clean and useful improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve the code structure by moving the multi-device fixup code in the denali_init() function to a separate helper function called denali_multidev_fixup(). This change helps in organizing the code and makes it more readable and maintainable.

The denali_multidev_fixup() function performs necessary calculations and adjustments related to multi-device support. It updates various fields and properties of the nand_chip and mtd_info structures based on the value of denali->devnum. These updates ensure that the core framework is aware of the logical pagesize and other necessary information when multiple NAND devices are connected in parallel.

The original code in denali_init() also contained similar calculations and adjustments for multi-device support. However, these have been removed from denali_init() and moved to the new helper function. This change reduces code duplication and improves code modularity.

Additionally, the patch also updates the ECC sector size in the nand_chip structure to a fixed value (ECC_SECTOR_SIZE) instead of multiplying it by denali->devnum. This change ensures that the ECC sector size remains consistent regardless of the number of devices connected.

Overall, the patch improves code organization, reduces duplication, and ensures consistent behavior in multi-device scenarios. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to set the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer in the meson_i2c driver. This change is beneficial because the bus frequency is fixed to what is set in the device tree (DT), so there is no need to set the clock divider for each transfer.

The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and the related code that sets the clock divider based on this frequency. Instead, the frequency value is obtained from the device tree using the "clock-frequency" property. If the property is not found, a default frequency is used.

The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is modified to accept the frequency as an argument and set the clock divider accordingly.

In the "meson_i2c_probe" function, after initializing the "i2c" structure, the clock divider is set using the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function with the frequency obtained from the device tree.

Overall, this patch simplifies the code by setting the clock divider in the probe function and removes the need to set it for each transfer. It also improves maintainability by obtaining the frequency value from the device tree. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

```
static int rawv6_send_hdrinc(struct sock *sk, void *from, int length,
```
to:
```
static int rawv6_send_hdrinc(struct sock *sk, struct msghdr *msg, int length,
```

Additionally, the patch updates the line:
```
err = memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, from, 0, length);
```
to:
```
err = memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, msg->msg_iter.iov, 0, length);
```

The change ensures that the `msg` structure is used directly instead of extracting the `iov` field from it. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and reasonable modification that improves the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. Similarly, in the `saa7134_streamoff` function, the `pm_qos_remove_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is removed from the correct `qos_request` field.

4. In the `saa7134_fh` structure, the `qos_request` field is removed since it is no longer needed.

5. In the `saa7134_dev` structure, the `qos_request` field is added to store the `qos_request` for the device.

Overall, the patch improves the code by correctly handling the `qos_request` field at the device level instead of the file handle level. This change ensures that the request is added and removed correctly, improving the stability and performance of the driver.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the `nand_bbt.c` file of the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem. It introduces changes to handle ECC errors differently when scanning for simple bad block markers.

The patch adds checks to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers. Previously, any ECC error would result in a non-zero return value, which could be misleading when scanning for bad block markers. By ignoring ECC errors in this specific context, the patch ensures that the relevant markers are still considered non-0xFF for true bad blocks.

The changes are localized to specific sections of the code where the `read_oob()` function is called. In each case, the return value of `read_oob()` is checked, and if it indicates an ECC error (`-EUCLEAN` or `-EBADMSG`), the error is ignored and the function returns 0. This allows the scanning process to continue without considering ECC errors as fatal.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement to handle ECC errors during the scanning process for bad block markers. It does not introduce any significant risks or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the purpose and impact of this patch.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch enables setting the minimum inline header mode for Virtual Functions (VFs) in the mlx5 driver.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to modify the minimum inline header mode for a specific VF.
   - The function takes the mlx5_core_dev structure, VF vport number, and the desired minimum inline value as input parameters.
   - It initializes the input buffer `in` with the necessary values to modify the VF's minimum inline header mode.
   - It calls the `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` function to modify the VF's context with the new minimum inline value.
   - The function returns the result of the `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` function.

3. Exported Functions:
   - The patch exports the function `mlx5_query_nic_vport_min_inline`, which queries the minimum inline header mode for a VF.
   - The patch also exports the newly added function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline`.

4. Header Files:
   - The patch modifies the `struct mlx5_ifc_modify_nic_vport_field_select_bits` structure in `mlx5_ifc.h` to include the `min_inline` field.
   - The patch adds the function prototype for `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` in `vport.h`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds functionality to modify and query the minimum inline header mode for VFs in the mlx5 driver.

2. The patch sets the suspend_bias_off flag to true in the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures. This flag indicates that the CODEC driver should automatically handle the bias level transition during suspend, rather than manually setting it to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF.

3. The patch removes the adau17x1_suspend function, which was previously used to manually set the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF during suspend. This function is no longer needed since the suspend_bias_off flag is set to true.

4. The adau17x1_resume function remains unchanged and is responsible for handling the resume operation of the CODEC driver.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing functionality. It only improves the code structure and removes redundant code.

Overall, the patch improves code cleanliness and reduces redundancy by utilizing the suspend_bias_off flag instead of manually setting the bias level during suspend. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event`. This change is made because the name `pga_event` was misleading. Renaming the function improves code clarity and maintainability.

2. The `out_drv_event` function is used as an event handler for the OUT_DRV widgets. It is responsible for handling events related to the output drivers.

3. The patch updates the usage of the renamed function `out_drv_event` in the DAPM widgets for various output drivers (HF Left Driver, HF Right Driver, HS Left Driver, HS Right Driver, and Earphone Driver).

4. The patch removes the `mute` member from the `twl6040_output` structure. This change is not related to the function renaming and seems unrelated to the main purpose of the patch.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity by renaming the function and updates the usage of the renamed function in the DAPM widgets. The removal of the `mute` member seems unrelated to the main purpose of the patch but does not introduce any obvious issues.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "ASoC: max98090: read micbias from device property." It suggests reading the max98090 micbias from ACPI or device tree (DT).

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by Fang, Yang A <yang.a.fang@intel.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>,Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/max98090.txt.

3. Patch Changes:
   The patch adds a new optional property "maxim,micbias" to specify the micbias voltage for the analog mic. It defines valid voltage values and their corresponding meanings.

4. Code Changes:
   The code changes are made in the max98090_probe() function in max98090.c file.

   - The patch adds a new variable "micbias" and initializes it.
   - It reads the "maxim,micbias" property from the device using device_property_read_u32() function.
   - If the property is not found, it sets the micbias to the default value (M98090_MBVSEL_2V8) and prints a dev_info message.
   - If the property is found but its value is out of the valid range, it sets the micbias to the default value and prints a dev_err message.
   - It updates the micbias value in the codec using snd_soc_update_bits() function.
   - Finally, it calls max98090_add_widgets() function.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a useful feature to read the micbias from device properties, allowing for more flexibility and customization. The code changes appear to be well-implemented and handle error cases appropriately.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there was a regression introduced by the commit d0b1252d in the file patch_hdmi.c. The pin NID assignment was not done correctly, causing the issue. 

The patch fixes this regression by correctly assigning the pin NID in the spec->pins[0].pin_nid field. This ensures that the pin NID is assigned correctly and resolves the reported issue.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a regression, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers: "dcssblk" and "xpram". The "owner" field is typically used to keep track of the module that owns the driver.

In this case, the patch is removing the assignment of "THIS_MODULE" to the "owner" field. This suggests that the driver core will handle populating the "owner" field, and it is not necessary for the platform drivers to explicitly set it.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the "owner" assignment does not seem to have any negative impact on the functionality of the drivers, and it aligns with the standard practice of letting the driver core handle the "owner" field.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture for the function `leon_configure_cache_smp()`. The warning suggests that the function is referenced from `leon_callin()` in the `.cpuinit.text` section, but the actual implementation is in the `.init.text` section.

The patch modifies the declaration of `leon_configure_cache_smp()` to include the `__cpuinit` annotation, which ensures that the function is only called during CPU initialization. This annotation helps to resolve the section mismatch warning.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a warning, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch and its impact on the system is necessary before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it suggests changing the log level from `pr_info` to `pr_debug` for the heap creation print in the `ion_chunk_heap_create` function. This change is aimed at improving the logging behavior by reducing the verbosity of success messages.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change aligns with the best practice of using appropriate log levels, making the logging behavior more consistent and less noisy.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be defining the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. The patch adds the definitions for the CONT_PTES and CONT_RANGE_OFFSET macros in the pgtable-hwdef.h header file.

Considering the nature of this patch, it seems to be a straightforward addition of definitions and does not involve any changes to existing code or functionality. Therefore, it can be considered a safe and non-disruptive patch.

Given this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch is marked as "mm, slub: mark resiliency_test as init text." This indicates that the patch is related to the memory management subsystem (mm) and the SLUB allocator (slub). The purpose of the patch is to mark the resiliency_test() function as init text.

2. The patch description mentions that resiliency_test() is only called during the bootstrap process. Moving it to init.text and freeing it after boot can help optimize memory usage.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including David Rientjes, Christoph Lameter, Pekka Enberg, Joonsoo Kim, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds. This indicates that it has undergone review and approval from experienced developers.

4. The change itself modifies the resiliency_test() function by adding the __init attribute. This attribute marks the function as part of the initialization code and allows the kernel to discard it after boot, freeing up memory resources.

5. The change does not appear to introduce any new functionality or alter existing behavior. It is a performance optimization that improves memory usage during the bootstrap process.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch is safe and beneficial for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. The patch includes changes to the ixgbe_main.c file, specifically in the ixgbe_irq_enable() function.

The patch checks if the device ID is IXGBE_DEV_ID_X550EM_X_SFP and if so, it enables the GPI_SDP0 interrupt mask. This indicates that the patch is adding support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it adds support for a specific hardware feature, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes a redundant NULL check for the "brd" value in the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function. It states that the "brd" value cannot be NULL in this function because it was already checked for NULL as a parameter. Additionally, the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function is called only from the dgnc_found_board() function, and the brd->magic value is assigned once in dgnc_found_board(). Therefore, there is no need to check for the DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value.

Removing the redundant NULL check improves code readability and eliminates unnecessary checks, making the code more efficient. As a result, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to initializing the correct nvm channel list for 8000 series devices in the iwlwifi driver. The patch ensures that the regulatory data contains the correct channels for the 8000 series devices.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using the core function `irq_set_affinity` instead of a custom implementation for hotplug irq migration code. This change eliminates the need for an incomplete copy of `irq_set_affinity()`.

2. The patch also switches from using `for_each_irq_desc()` to `for_each_active_irq()`. This change ensures that only active IRQs are considered during the migration process.

3. The `route_irq()` function, which was previously used to set the affinity for an IRQ, is removed. Instead, the `irq_set_affinity()` function is directly called to set the affinity for each IRQ.

4. The `migrate_irqs()` function is modified to iterate over each active IRQ and set the affinity using `irq_set_affinity()`.

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the core function `irq_set_affinity()` and `for_each_active_irq()`, making it more efficient and eliminating the need for custom code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `ptlrpc_replay_next` function in the `recover.c` file of the `drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/ptlrpc` directory. Here are the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch adds a condition to check if `req` is not NULL, `imp->imp_resend_replay` is true, and `req->rq_unreplied_list` is empty.
2. If the condition is true, the `ptlrpc_add_unreplied` function is called to add `req` to the unreplied list.
3. After adding `req` to the unreplied list, the `imp->imp_known_replied_xid` is updated by calling the `ptlrpc_known_replied_xid` function.
4. Finally, the `imp->imp_resend_replay` flag is set to 0, and the `imp_lock` spinlock is released.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary update to the `imp_known_replied_xid` variable when a replay request is resent. This update ensures that the `imp_known_replied_xid` is correctly updated when the xid of the replay request is less than the current `imp_known_replied_xid`.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple addition of the `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE` macro for the AMBA driver in the `nomadik-rng.c` file. This macro is used to generate the module alias information for the AMBA driver.

Considering that this patch is adding necessary module alias autogeneration for AMBA drivers, it is likely a bug fix or an improvement for the stability of the Linux kernel. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix for a comment typo in the PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_CLKPM definition in the include/uapi/linux/pci_regs.h file. The typo is corrected by removing the word "L1" from the comment.

Based on the nature of the patch, it does not introduce any functional changes or fix any critical issues. It only corrects a comment typo, which does not affect the behavior or functionality of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() function in the drivers/mmc/core/block.c file. The code currently assigns the local variable mq_rq to the current MMC queue request when aborting a command due to improper alignment on large sectors. However, the variable mq_rq is not used after this jump, which can be confusing.

The patch removes the assignment of mq_rq, as it is unnecessary and does not affect the functionality of the code. This change improves code clarity and eliminates confusion.

The patch has been signed-off by Linus Walleij and Ulf Hansson, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the respective authors.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch adds an optimized swahb32() byteswap helper for ARMv6 and later processors. This helper utilizes the REV16 instruction, which swaps the bytes within each halfword of a register value. This optimization can improve performance for certain operations.

2. The existing swab16() helper is renamed to swahb32() to reflect the actual operation performed by the REV16 instruction. This allows calls to both swab16() and swahb32() to be optimized.

3. The patch defines __arch_swab16() in terms of the renamed swahb32() helper. This ensures that calls to __arch_swab16() can also benefit from the optimization.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs and review acknowledgments from relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The changes do not appear to introduce any potential issues or regressions. The affected functions, CopyBufferToControlPacket() and StatisticsResponse(), are updated to use "void *" instead of PVOID for the ioBuffer and pvBuffer parameters, respectively. This change is consistent with the expected type for these buffers.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward and beneficial change that improves code readability without introducing any known issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces the use of platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions. These functions simplify the implementation of multi-driver modules and handle the failure to register one driver by unregistering all previously registered drivers. This is a beneficial change as it improves the robustness and maintainability of the code.

2. The patch updates the omap_drm_init() function to use platform_register_drivers() instead of individually registering each driver. This reduces code duplication and makes the initialization process more concise.

3. Similarly, the omap_drm_fini() function is updated to use platform_unregister_drivers() instead of individually unregistering each driver. This ensures that all drivers are properly unregistered during the cleanup process.

4. The patch also introduces a new drivers[] array that contains the drivers to be registered. This array is passed to platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions, ensuring that all drivers are handled consistently.

Overall, the patch improves the code by simplifying the driver registration and unregistration process, making it more robust and maintainable. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to the enum nft_set_flags in nf_tables.h. This flag indicates that the set contains expressions for evaluation.

2. In nf_tables_api.c, the patch adds support for the NFT_SET_EVAL flag in the nf_tables_newset function. It checks if the NFT_SET_EVAL flag is set in the flags parameter and returns -EOPNOTSUPP (operation not supported) if both NFT_SET_MAP and NFT_SET_EVAL flags are set simultaneously. This ensures that the set can only be used for either mapping or evaluation, but not both.

3. In nft_lookup.c, the patch adds a check to reject sets with the NFT_SET_EVAL flag in the nft_lookup_init function. This prevents binding to state tables since the lookup operation only deals with lookup and map operations, not evaluation.

Overall, the patch introduces a new flag to indicate sets containing expressions for evaluation and ensures that sets can only be used for either mapping or evaluation, but not both. It also adds appropriate checks to reject unsupported operations. These changes appear to be reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

4. The patch updates the `create_css()` function to call `init_and_link_css()` instead of `init_css()`. This change ensures consistency and improves code organization.

5. The patch updates the `cgroup_init_subsys()` function to call `init_and_link_css()` instead of `init_css()` for the default root cgroup. This change ensures consistency and improves code organization.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity, maintainability, and consistency without introducing any known issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This prefix indicates that the function is only called from other functions annotated with __init, which are typically used during the initialization phase of the kernel. Adding __init to prandom_start_seed_timer() ensures that it is only executed during the initialization phase, potentially freeing up resources after its usage.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer(). This change makes it clear that the function is an internal one and not intended for external use.

3. The patch modifies the prandom_reseed() function to call __prandom_start_seed_timer() instead of prandom_start_seed_timer(). This change ensures consistency and avoids any potential confusion.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement to the codebase, ensuring proper resource management during initialization. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed by the kernel's resource management framework. This change reduces code size and simplifies the code.

The devm_kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the adt7411_data structure. This function automatically frees the memory when the device is unregistered, eliminating the need for manual memory deallocation.

The error handling in the probe function is improved. Instead of using a goto statement to jump to the exit_free label, the function now returns the error code directly. This makes the code more readable and reduces the risk of resource leaks.

Similarly, in the remove function, the manual memory deallocation is removed, as devm_kzalloc takes care of freeing the memory.

Overall, the patch improves code readability, reduces code size, and simplifies error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `regmap_init_i2c()` with `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. This change makes the regmap initialization device-managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup.

2. The patch fixes a potential bug by adding an explicit `regmap_exit` call, which was missing in the original code.

3. The patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Sachin Kamat and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior; it only improves the code by using a more appropriate function.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch adds a path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file in the `vmlinux_path__init` function of `symbol.c` file in the `tools/perf/util` directory. It modifies the allocation of memory for `vmlinux_path` by increasing the size from 5 to 6. It then constructs the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file and assigns it to `vmlinux_path[vmlinux_path__nr_entries]`. Finally, it constructs the path to the vmlinux file in the `/lib/modules` directory and assigns it to `vmlinux_path[vmlinux_path__nr_entries]`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds support for the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file and updates the allocation of memory for `vmlinux_path` to accommodate the new path. The changes seem reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This Linux kernel patch is a trivial fix for a typo in the rtc-imxdi.c file. It corrects the spelling of "Temperatur" to "Temperature" in the comment.

So, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks in the `moboard_uart0_init()` and `moboard_uart0_exit()` functions respectively. It also removes the `uart0_pdata` structure and its initialization.

The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is modified to directly perform the operations previously done in the `init()` callback. It requests a GPIO pin, sets its direction, and frees it if necessary.

In the `mx31moboard_init()` function, the `moboard_uart0_init()` function is called to initialize the UART0 device.

In the `serial_imx_probe()` function, the `pdata->init()` callback is removed, and the `uart_add_one_port()` function is called directly.

In the `serial_imx_remove()` function, the `pdata->exit()` callback is removed, and the `uart_remove_one_port()` function is called directly.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary `init()` and `exit()` callbacks and directly performing the required operations. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs.

Considering that the patch simplifies the code without introducing any issues, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is intended to initialize the BBP_R103 register on various subroutines in the rt2800 driver. The patch adds code to set the value of BBP_R103 to 0xc0 in certain conditions and to 0x00 in other conditions.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and consideration of potential side effects, should be conducted before finalizing the decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the VIDIOC_TRY_FMT function in the coda.c file of the media subsystem. The issue is that the sizeimage field is incorrectly calculated as height * bytesperline, instead of width * height * 3 / 2.

2. The patch correctly updates the sizeimage calculation to width * height * 3 / 2, which is the correct calculation for YUV420 format.

3. The patch also updates the vidioc_s_fmt function to use the sizeimage value from the v4l2_format structure, instead of calculating it based on the format type.

4. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the respective individuals.

5. The changes made by the patch are localized to the coda.c file and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC. This change allows for better parameter handling and documentation.

2. The patch introduces a new module parameter named "tx_buffers" to set the number of transmit USB buffers. This provides flexibility for users to configure the number of buffers within the defined limits of the driver.

3. The patch updates the device_set_options function to use the new "tx_buffers" parameter. It checks if the value falls within the defined limits and sets the number of transmit buffers accordingly. If the value is outside the limits, it falls back to the default value.

Overall, the patch improves the configurability and robustness of the driver by replacing the DEVICE_PARAM macro and introducing a new module parameter. It also ensures that the user cannot set the number of transmit buffers beyond the defined limits of the driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests using the devm_* APIs for device management in the iio: dac: ad5504 driver. These APIs simplify the code and handle resource management automatically. 

The changes made in the patch include:
1. Replacing the iio_device_alloc() function with devm_iio_device_alloc() to allocate memory for the iio device structure.
2. Replacing regulator_get() with devm_regulator_get() to retrieve the regulator for the "vcc" supply.
3. Replacing request_threaded_irq() with devm_request_threaded_irq() to request and handle the interrupt.
4. Removing the error handling code related to freeing the IRQ and putting the regulator, as devm_* APIs handle these automatically.
5. Removing the iio_device_free() call in the error handling path of ad5504_probe() and ad5504_remove() functions, as devm_iio_device_alloc() takes care of freeing the device.

Overall, these changes improve the code by simplifying it and ensuring proper resource management using the devm_* APIs. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch iterates over all controllers and populates them with the MSI operations. This ensures that the MSI operations are correctly set up for each controller.

3. The patch also updates the `setup_msi_irqs` and `teardown_msi_irqs` function pointers in the `pci_controller_ops` structure for each controller. This ensures that the correct MSI setup and teardown functions are used for each controller.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues or potential regressions.

Overall, the patch improves the code structure and ensures correct MSI operations for the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces a call to the deprecated function `devm_request_and_ioremap` with the recommended function `devm_ioremap_resource`. This change ensures that the codebase follows best practices and avoids using deprecated functions.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes to replace the deprecated function call. The old code is replaced with the new function call `devm_ioremap_resource(&pdev->dev, res)`.

3. The patch also handles the error case properly. If `devm_ioremap_resource` returns an error (indicated by `IS_ERR(data->base)`), the patch returns the error code `PTR_ERR(data->base)` instead of the previous `-EBUSY`. This change improves error handling and provides more accurate error reporting.

4. The patch includes appropriate sign-offs from the authors and an Acked-by from another contributor, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the codebase and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made:

1. The patch avoids an unnecessary register read for the base VF id.
2. The base VF id is already stored in the HW struct, so there is no need to read it again.
3. The code is modified to use the base VF id from the HW struct instead of reading it from the register.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch improves efficiency by eliminating an unnecessary register read. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a performance improvement rather than a bug fix.

Considering that stable releases typically focus on bug fixes and critical security updates, this patch may not be suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it could be considered for inclusion in future non-stable releases or as part of a performance optimization effort.

Therefore, my recommendation is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here are the reasons for my recommendation:

1. The patch improves the efficiency of the scsi_run_queue() function by avoiding unnecessary acquisition of the host lock when there are no starved devices. This optimization can lead to better performance in scenarios where there are no starved devices.

2. The patch splits the scsi_run_queue() function into two separate functions, scsi_starved_list_run() and scsi_run_queue(). This improves code readability and maintainability by separating the logic for handling starved devices from the logic for selecting the next request queue to serve.

3. The patch has been reviewed by two individuals, Christoph Hellwig and Hannes Reinecke, who have provided their signed-off-by and reviewed-by tags respectively. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and has received positive feedback from experienced developers.

Based on these factors, I believe that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the aesthetics and readability of the code by renaming the function "atao_ao_rinsn" to "atao_ao_insn_read". This change helps with grepping and follows the normal format for analog output read back functions. This is a valid improvement.

2. The patch updates the function signature of "atao_ao_rinsn" to match the new name "atao_ao_insn_read". The function now takes the appropriate parameters: "struct comedi_device *dev", "struct comedi_subdevice *s", "struct comedi_insn *insn", and "unsigned int *data". This change aligns with the function's purpose and improves code clarity.

3. The patch introduces a new variable "chan" to store the channel information extracted from "insn->chanspec". This variable is then used to read the corresponding data from "devpriv->ao_readback" and populate the "data" array. This change ensures correct data retrieval and improves code readability.

4. The patch updates the return statement of "atao_ao_insn_read" to return "insn->n" instead of "i". This change ensures that the correct number of samples is returned, aligning with the purpose of the function.

5. The patch updates the assignment of "s->insn_read" in the "atao_attach" function to point to the renamed function "atao_ao_insn_read". This ensures that the correct function is used for analog output read instructions.

Overall, the patch improves code aesthetics, readability, and correctness without introducing any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` field from the `sl811h_driver` structure in the `sl811-hcd.c` file. The patch claims that there is no need to set the `.owner` field explicitly as the core will handle it automatically.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. The purpose of the `.owner` field: The `.owner` field is used to keep track of the module that "owns" the driver structure. It is typically set to `THIS_MODULE` to ensure that the module is not unloaded while the driver is still in use.

2. The impact of removing the `.owner` field: If the `.owner` field is removed, it means that the ownership tracking mechanism will not be in place. This could potentially lead to issues if the module is unloaded while the driver is still being used.

3. The rationale provided in the patch: The patch claims that there is no need to set the `.owner` field explicitly as the core will handle it automatically. However, it does not provide any specific details or justification for this claim.

Based on the above analysis, I would lean towards a NAK (not accepting the patch) for the following reasons:

- The patch removes the `.owner` field without providing a clear justification or explanation for why it is no longer needed.
- Removing the `.owner` field could potentially introduce issues if the module is unloaded while the driver is still in use.

However, it is important to note that this decision is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough analysis, including testing and consideration of the broader context, would be necessary to make a final determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple change in the ARM amba driver for the netx platform. The patch removes the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field of the fb_device structure.

2. The patch renames the variable "iReturn" to "ret" for better readability and adherence to coding conventions.

3. The patch also adds comments to explain the purpose of the flags being set in the "ret" variable.

4. The patch correctly updates the "ret" variable to include the U14TF_USB2 flag if the device is USB2.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the function. It only improves code readability and adherence to coding conventions.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a simple and straightforward improvement to the code. It does not introduce any potential issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow warning in the btrfs send functionality.
2. The patch checks if the multiplication of "sizeof(*arg->clone_sources)" and "arg->clone_sources_count" would cause an overflow.
3. If the multiplication would result in an overflow, the patch returns an error (-EINVAL) and exits.
4. The patch ensures that the "arg->clone_sources" buffer is accessible and within the expected size limits.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the integer overflow warning and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is moving the DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE quirk for alc255 in the ALSA Realtek driver. The patch removes the quirk from the SND_PCI_QUIRK table and adds it to the SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK table.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Purpose of the patch: The patch seems to be addressing a specific issue related to the Dell ALC255 audio codec. It is moving the quirk from one table to another, which suggests a reorganization or improvement in the code.

2. Impact on stability: Since this patch is related to audio functionality, it is crucial to ensure that it does not introduce any regressions or stability issues. We need to review the changes made to the pin quirk table and verify that they are correct and do not conflict with other hardware configurations.

3. Testing and validation: It is important to consider whether this patch has been tested and validated on relevant hardware configurations. If there is evidence of thorough testing and positive results, it increases the likelihood of the patch being accepted.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision without further context, such as the rationale behind the change and any testing/validation results. However, if the patch has been thoroughly tested and validated, and the changes are deemed necessary and correct, it is likely that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if there are concerns about stability or lack of testing, it may be more appropriate to not accept the patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for using PCI MSIs (Message Signaled Interrupts) in the rt2x00pci driver. MSIs are a more efficient way of handling interrupts compared to traditional interrupt mechanisms.

2. The patch enables MSI support by calling `pci_enable_msi(pci_dev)` in the `rt2x00pci_probe` function. This ensures that MSIs are used whenever possible.

3. In case of a failure to allocate hardware resources, the patch includes an error handling path (`goto exit_disable_msi`) that disables MSI support using `pci_disable_msi(pci_dev)` before returning an error.

4. In the `rt2x00pci_remove` function, the patch also includes a call to `pci_disable_msi(pci_dev)` to disable MSI support before freeing resources.

Overall, the patch adds support for using PCI MSIs in the rt2x00pci driver and includes proper error handling for enabling and disabling MSI support. Since MSIs are a more efficient interrupt mechanism, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a type mismatch issue and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes a duplicate error message related to memory allocation failure using devm_kzalloc(). This duplication is unnecessary and can be safely removed.

2. The devm_kzalloc() function already includes a warning message if the allocation fails. Therefore, the duplicate error message is redundant and can be safely removed.

3. The removal of the duplicate error message does not affect the functionality or behavior of the code.

4. The patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Peter Hurley and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing an unused macro called "IS_MAC_ADDRESS_BROADCAST" from the file "rtl871x_ioctl_set.c" in the staging directory of the Linux kernel. The macro is not being used anywhere in the codebase.

2. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Rob Clark and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone review and approval by them.

3. The code change itself is straightforward. It sets the `atomic` flag of the `ifbdev->helper` structure to true, enabling atomic fb-helper support.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or major changes. It simply enables an existing feature that the i915 driver already supports.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial addition to the Linux kernel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch adds error handling for the `hdmi_probe_pdata()` function in the `hdmi.c` file of the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. The purpose of this error handling is to properly handle the case when a resource is missing, by returning an appropriate error code.

The `hdmi_probe_pdata()` function previously had a void return type, but it has been changed to `int` to allow for error handling. The function now returns 0 if `plat_dssdev` is not found, -ENOMEM if `dssdev` allocation fails, and the error code returned by `dss_add_device()` if it fails.

In the `omapdss_hdmihw_probe()` function, the `hdmi_probe_pdata()` function is called, and if it returns an error, the necessary cleanup actions are performed, including calling `hdmi_panel_exit()`, `hdmi_uninit_output()`, and disabling the runtime PM.

Overall, this patch improves the error handling in the OMAPDSS HDMI driver, ensuring that errors are properly handled and appropriate actions are taken.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is aimed at fixing the antenna diversity configuration for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. It introduces conditional statements to set different values for the antenna configuration based on the chip type.

The patch checks if the chip is AR9485 using the AR_SREV_9485 macro. If it is, it sets the lna1_lna2_delta value to -9 and the div_group value to 2. These values are appropriate for AR9485 chips.

If the chip is not AR9485, the patch sets the lna1_lna2_delta value to -3 and the div_group value to 0. These values are specific to non-AR9485 chips.

By introducing these conditional statements, the patch ensures that the correct antenna diversity configuration is used for different chip types, addressing the issue mentioned in the patch description.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose and the changes it introduces, it appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

In general, cosmetic changes like this are not typically accepted in stable releases unless they are part of a larger patch series that includes functional changes or bug fixes. Cosmetic changes alone do not provide any significant benefit to stable releases and can potentially introduce unnecessary risks.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch enables the Kirkwood audio driver to be built on mvebu platforms. This suggests that the audio unit found in the Armada 370 SoC is similar to the one used in the Marvell Kirkwood and Marvell Dove SoCs.

2. An additional compatible string, "marvell,armada370-audio," is added to identify the Armada 370 variant of the audio unit. This ensures proper identification and compatibility.

3. The patch modifies the Kconfig file to include the ARCH_MVEBU dependency for the Kirkwood audio driver. This ensures that the driver is built for mvebu platforms.

4. The patch also adds the "marvell,armada370-audio" compatible string to the mvebu_audio_of_match array in the kirkwood-i2s.c file. This allows the driver to match the compatible string and handle the Armada 370 audio unit correctly.

Overall, the patch seems to address compatibility and enable the Kirkwood audio driver for mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the 'thisboard' macro, which relies on a local variable with a specific name. This macro is replaced with local variables and the use of the 'comedi_board()' helper function to obtain the pointer.

2. The 'thisboard' macro is no longer necessary and can be replaced with a more standard approach using local variables. This improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to use the 'comedi_board()' helper function to obtain the pointer to the board structure.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves the code structure and removes reliance on a specific variable name.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a clean and necessary improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new property called "phy-reset-duration" for device tree probe. This property allows boards to specify a longer reset duration for the phy if needed. This is a useful addition as different boards may require different reset durations.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the "phy-reset-duration" property is only used if the "phy-reset-gpios" property is available. This ensures that the reset duration is only applied when the phy reset GPIO is present.

3. The patch also includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not set to a value greater than 1000 milliseconds (1 second). If a value greater than 1000 is specified, the duration is set to 1 millisecond instead. This prevents invalid values from being used.

4. The patch modifies the "fec_reset_phy" function to read the "phy-reset-duration" property and use it as the reset duration. If the property is not present, the default duration of 1 millisecond is used.

5. The patch includes proper error handling for GPIO request and sets the GPIO value to 1 after the reset duration.

Overall, the patch adds a useful feature and includes necessary checks and error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to convert the comedi_subdevice access from pointer math to array access in the pcmad driver. This change replaces the line `s = dev->subdevices + 0;` with `s = &dev->subdevices[0];`.

The use of pointer math can be error-prone and harder to understand, especially when dealing with arrays. By using array access, the code becomes more readable and less prone to mistakes.

Additionally, this change does not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of the driver. It only improves the code's clarity and maintainability.

Therefore, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch constifies the "nct7802_regmap_config" struct by adding the "const" keyword before the struct definition. This indicates that the struct is not modified by the driver and can be treated as read-only. The patch also mentions that the "regmap_init()" function accepts a pointer to a const struct, which further justifies the constification of the struct.

By making the struct const, it ensures that the struct is not accidentally modified, which can help prevent potential bugs or unintended behavior. Therefore, it is a safe and reasonable change to include in the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves interrupt handling in the meson-gx-mmc driver.
2. Previously, interrupts were disabled and immediately re-enabled in the meson_mmc_request function, which didn't provide any benefit. The patch removes this unnecessary disable and enable sequence.
3. Instead, interrupts are now enabled in the probe function, which is the appropriate place to enable interrupts during initialization.
4. Additionally, the patch adds the missing disable interrupts sequence in the remove function, ensuring proper cleanup.

2. The first change removes a check for `need_unsync` and `s->unsync` when `!s->unsync` is already sufficient. This simplifies the logic and makes the code more readable.

3. The second change modifies the condition for `need_remote_flush` by removing the `!remote_flush` check. This change ensures that `need_remote_flush` is always evaluated, which is likely the intended behavior.

Overall, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement to the code. It removes unnecessary checks and simplifies the logic without introducing any obvious issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to optimize the code by avoiding redundant calls to the function "ilk_pipe_pixel_rate()" in the "skl_compute_linetime_wm()" function. Previously, the function "skl_compute_linetime_wm()" called "ilk_pipe_pixel_rate()" twice, which could be inefficient if the function is computationally expensive.

The patch introduces a new variable "pixel_rate" and assigns the result of the first call to "ilk_pipe_pixel_rate()" to it. Then, the second call to "ilk_pipe_pixel_rate()" is replaced with the usage of the stored "pixel_rate" variable. This change ensures that the function "ilk_pipe_pixel_rate()" is called only once, improving performance.

Additionally, the patch includes a check using "WARN_ON()" to verify if the "pixel_rate" is zero. If it is zero, the function returns 0. This check helps to catch any potential issues with the "pixel_rate" calculation.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable optimization that improves code efficiency without introducing any obvious risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a simple code cleanup.

2. Similarly, the patch also makes the function `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. This ensures that the function is only accessible within the same source file, providing better control over its usage and preventing potential issues.

3. Making these functions static does not affect their functionality or behavior. It simply restricts their visibility to the current source file, which is a good practice for improving code maintainability and reducing potential bugs.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on these considerations, the patch appears to be a reasonable and beneficial change that improves code organization and encapsulation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where an info message is printed with the name 'uninitialised' if the netdev is not registered before connecting the phy. By registering the netdev first and then connecting the phy, this issue can be avoided.

The patch moves the call to `dsa_slave_phy_setup()` after registering the netdev. This ensures that the phy setup is only performed after the netdev is registered successfully. If the phy setup fails, an error message is printed, and the slave device is freed.

The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior significantly. It only reorders the code to ensure proper registration of the netdev before performing the phy setup.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any known regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch removes the use of BUG_ON macro from the mmc_ext_csd_open function in debugfs.c. The use of BUG_ON is replaced with proper error handling.

2. Instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch introduces an error variable 'err' and sets it to -EINVAL if the condition 'n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN' is true.

3. The error value is then propagated to the caller by jumping to the 'out_free' label, where the allocated memory is freed before returning the error value.

4. The patch does not modify any other functionality or behavior of the code.

Based on this analysis, the patch improves the error handling in the mmc_ext_csd_open function by returning an error value instead of triggering a BUG_ON. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The original line of code is:
```
pr_debug("mapping: iova 0x%lx pa 0x%lx pgsize %lu\n", iova, (unsigned long)paddr, pgsize);
```

The patch modifies the line to:
```
pr_debug("mapping: iova 0x%lx pa 0x%lx pgsize %lu\n", iova, (unsigned long)paddr, (unsigned long)pgsize);
```

The change adds an explicit cast to the pgsize argument to match the format specifier %lu, resolving the compiler warning.

Since this patch addresses a compiler warning and does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues, it can be considered safe for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The `greybus_get_drvdata` function call is replaced with `gdev->gb_tty` to retrieve the `gb_tty` structure in the `gb_tty_disconnect` function. This change ensures consistency and improves code readability.

4. The `greybus_set_drvdata` function call is modified to assign `NULL` to `gdev->gb_tty` in the `gb_tty_disconnect` function. This change ensures that the `gb_tty` structure is properly released and set to `NULL` during device disconnection.

Overall, the patch addresses proper tying of the `gb_tty` structure into the `gb` core and ensures correct handling of the structure during device probe and disconnect. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new constant `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` with a value of 16, representing the fixed block size of the LRW algorithm.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` with `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` in multiple places within the `lrw.c` file.

3. The `setkey()` function now uses `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of `crypto_cipher_blocksize(child)` to determine the block size.

4. The `crypt()` function also uses `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of `crypto_cipher_blocksize(ctx->child)` to determine the block size.

5. The `init_tfm()` function checks if the block size of the cipher is equal to `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of a hardcoded value of 16.

Overall, the patch improves code readability and maintainability by using a constant for the fixed block size instead of relying on the `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` function. It ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors related to block size calculations.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to drop references to "virtual" IRQ in the mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map function. It renames the argument "virq" to "irq" since the IRQ is not any more "virtual" than any other Linux IRQ number. The patch also updates the function calls to use the new argument name.

The changes made in the patch seem reasonable and do not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It is a clean-up change that improves code clarity by removing unnecessary references to "virtual" IRQ.

Additionally, the patch includes proper Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Considering the patch's purpose and the changes it introduces, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch enhances the functionality of the Wacom HID driver by recognizing additional fields, which can improve compatibility and usability for Wacom devices.

However, it is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information. A more thorough review and testing of the patch would be necessary to ensure its correctness and compatibility with the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `clone_mnt` function in the `fs/namespace.c` file. The purpose of the patch is to carefully set the `CL_UNPRIVILEGED` flag in the `mnt` structure.

The patch introduces a condition to check if the `CL_EXPIRE` flag is set and if the `old->mnt_expire` list is empty. If either the `CL_EXPIRE` flag is not set or the `old->mnt_expire` list is empty, the `CL_UNPRIVILEGED` flag is set in the `mnt->mnt.mnt_flags` field.

This change ensures that the `CL_UNPRIVILEGED` flag is only set when the `CL_EXPIRE` flag is not set or the `old->mnt_expire` list is empty. This prevents unprivileged users from revealing what is under a mount, enhancing security.

The patch also increments the reference count of the superblock (`sb->s_active`).

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable and necessary modification to improve security in the Linux kernel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch modifies the "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6" structure in "include/net/netns/ipv6.h" to include the new knobs. It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c" and "net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c". Additionally, it modifies the usage of these knobs in "net/ipv6/addrconf.c" and "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c".

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing necessary changes to support the specified RFC and adds new functionality to the IPv6 subsystem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code refactoring. The patch moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h` where most other core code is declared. This change is done to accommodate the addition of a second knob.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be categorized as a clean-up or maintenance patch. Such patches are generally accepted in stable releases as they improve code organization and maintainability.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of auto-mute or auto-mic of retasked jacks. When a jack is retasked as a different direction (e.g., a mic jack used as a CLFE output), it shouldn't be counted as the target for automatic jack switching. The patch introduces a check to skip the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed.

The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` function to skip detecting pins that have been retasked as inputs. It checks the pin target using `snd_hda_codec_get_pin_target` and continues to the next pin if the pin is retasked as an input.

Similarly, the patch modifies the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function to skip detecting pins that have been retasked as outputs. It checks the pin target using `snd_hda_codec_get_pin_target` and continues to the next pin if the pin is retasked as an output.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of incorrect automatic jack switching for retasked jacks and ensures that only the appropriate pins are considered for automute or autoswitch.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is adding a missing cmpxchg64() function if CONFIG_RMW_INSNS=y. This suggests that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the cmpxchg64() function.

2. The error message indicates that the cmpxchg64() function is not declared, which implies that it is missing in the code.

3. The patch maps cmpxchg64 to cmpxchg64_local, which is already mapped to __cmpxchg64_local_generic. This ensures that cmpxchg64 is defined and points to the correct implementation.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the arch/m68k/include/asm/cmpxchg.h file.

Considering these points, it appears that the patch is fixing a missing function declaration and correctly mapping cmpxchg64. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. It introduces a dynamic calculation of the location of query 8 based on the presence of query registers, specifically query 6 and query 10.

The current implementation hardcodes the offset for query 8, assuming the presence of query 6 and query 10. However, if a touchpad does not report relative data, query 6 will not be present, and the address of query 8 will be one less. This patch calculates the location of query 8 dynamically, taking into account the presence of query 6 and query 10.

By introducing this dynamic calculation, the patch ensures that the correct address of query 8 is used, regardless of the presence or absence of query 6. This improves the reliability and compatibility of the HID RMI driver for touchpads.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Andrew Duggan and Jiri Kosina, indicating that it has undergone a review process and received approval from relevant stakeholders.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch moves the 64-bit feature fixup earlier in the code, specifically to the `early_setup()` function. This change ensures that the feature fixups are applied before turning on the MMU, which can have an impact on MMU management and interrupts. This aligns the behavior of 64-bit with what 32-bit does.

2. The patch includes the necessary function call `apply_feature_fixups()` in the `early_setup()` function to apply all the dynamic patching.

3. The `apply_feature_fixups()` function is also removed from the `setup_system()` function, as it has already been applied in `early_setup()`. This avoids redundant execution of the feature fixups.

Overall, the patch improves the order of operations and ensures that the feature fixups are applied at the appropriate time. It aligns the behavior of 64-bit with 32-bit and avoids redundant execution. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the zl10353_read_snr() function in the zl10353.c file under the drivers/media/dvb/frontends directory.

2. The purpose of the patch is to change the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported. Instead of using raw hardware register values, the SNR will be reported in a 0.1 dB scale.

3. The patch updates the calculation of the SNR value by multiplying the raw value (_snr) by 10 and dividing it by 8. This conversion ensures that the SNR is reported in the desired 0.1 dB scale.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors who made the changes.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the zl10353 driver, as it provides a more meaningful representation of the SNR. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the renesas-irqc driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds more register documentation and updates the register definitions.

Since this patch does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a non-critical update. Therefore, it is not necessary to include it in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a "line over 80" issue in the adv_pci1710 driver in the staging area of the Linux kernel. The fix involves removing a comment that caused the line to exceed 80 characters.

Considering that this is a simple code formatting issue and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for readability or maintainability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. It defines the missing symbol 'rspi_of_match' as NULL when CONFIG_OF is not enabled, preventing the build error from occurring. This fix allows the code to compile correctly in both cases, with and without CONFIG_OF.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Therefore, this patch is a valid fix for the build error and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a potential issue with the if statement in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function. The current if statement checks if the sscanf function does not return 1 and if mode is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the intention might have been to check if mode is not equal to 2 and mode is not equal to 1.

To clarify, the original if statement is:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 && (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

The corrected if statement should be:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 || (mode != 2 && mode != 1))
```

Based on this analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until the issue with the if statement is resolved.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code modification that replaces the direct assignment of `master->bits_per_word_mask` with the `SPI_BPW_MASK` macro in two different files (`spi-bfin-v3.c` and `spi-ti-qspi.c`). 

The `SPI_BPW_MASK` macro is used to set the bits per word mask for the SPI master. It takes the number of bits per word as an argument and returns the corresponding mask value. 

Since this patch replaces the manual assignment of the bits per word mask with the use of a macro, it improves code readability and maintainability. It also ensures consistency across different SPI drivers.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for the wil6210 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds debug prints for vring de-allocation in the `wil_vring_free` function.

Debug prints are typically used for debugging purposes and are not critical for the functionality of the driver. They provide additional information that can be helpful in diagnosing issues or understanding the driver's behavior.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any functional changes and only adds debug prints, it can be considered safe for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a clean-up and reorganization of variables related to the sdio layer in the brcm80211 driver. The patch moves the variables from dhd_linux.c to dhd_sdio.c for better organization.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug, it seems to be a non-functional change. Non-functional changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for maintaining code cleanliness or improving code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` functions. This change is made to avoid common clock framework warnings.

2. The patch introduces error handling for the new clock enable calls. If `clk_prepare_enable` fails, it jumps to the `out` label and disables the previously enabled clock before returning the error code.

3. Similarly, in the `atmel_usba_stop` function, the patch replaces `clk_disable` with `clk_disable_unprepare` to properly handle clock disabling.

4. In the `usba_udc_probe` function, the patch introduces error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls. If `clk_prepare_enable` fails, it logs an error message and jumps to the `err_clk_enable` label to clean up resources before returning the error code.

Overall, the patch improves the handling of clock enable and disable operations by using the appropriate functions from the common clock framework and introducing error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a clean-up patch that removes the use of __func__ from dev_err logging in the gdm72xx staging driver. The patch replaces __func__ with a generic error message.

In general, clean-up patches that improve code readability and maintainability are usually accepted in stable releases. However, it is important to consider the impact of the patch on the stability and functionality of the driver.

In this case, the patch does not seem to introduce any functional changes or affect the stability of the driver. It simply removes the specific instance of the device from the error message. As long as the error message still provides sufficient information for debugging purposes, this change should not cause any issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the final fixups from the __init section to the __devinit section. This change is necessary because final fixups are executed during device enumeration, which may occur after boot if hotplug is supported. Therefore, final fixups cannot be in the __init section.

2. The patch includes a changelog entry, which is a good practice for documenting the changes made.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author, Myron Stowe, and the maintainer, Bjorn Helgaas. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the relevant individuals.

4. The patch modifies the quirk_amd_nb_node function in the arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c file. The function sets correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc in the ftgmac100 driver. This separation is necessary because the ftgmac100 hardware revision in certain devices no longer reserves all bits in RXDES#2 and instead uses the bottom 16 bits to store MAC frame metadata. By separating the rx page storage, the patch avoids corruption issues.

2. The patch introduces a new member, `rx_pages`, in the `struct ftgmac100` to store the struct page pointers for rx pages.

3. The `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page` function is modified to take an additional argument, `struct ftgmac100 *priv`, to access the `rx_pages` member. This function sets the page pointer for a given rx descriptor.

4. The `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` function is also modified to take the `struct ftgmac100 *priv` argument to access the `rx_pages` member. This function retrieves the page pointer for a given rx descriptor.

5. The `ftgmac100_rx_packet` function is updated to pass the `struct ftgmac100 *priv` argument to `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` function, ensuring the correct page pointer is retrieved.

6. The `ftgmac100_alloc_rx_page` and `ftgmac100_free_buffers` functions are modified to pass the `struct ftgmac100 *priv` argument to `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page` and `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` functions, respectively, to ensure the correct page pointer is set and retrieved.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of potential corruption in the ftgmac100 driver and introduces the necessary changes to separate the rx page storage. It also maintains backward compatibility with older hardware revisions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The patch suggests using the spi_sync_transfer() helper function instead of open-coding it, which would make the code shorter. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

The patch removes the unnecessary spi_message and spi_message_add_tail calls, which were previously used to initialize and add the spi_transfer struct to the message. Instead, it directly calls spi_sync_transfer() with the spi_transfer struct and the number of transfers.

The functionality of the code remains the same, as the spi_sync_transfer() function performs the same operation as the previous open-coded implementation.

Overall, this patch simplifies the code and improves its readability without affecting its functionality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a typo in the code. The change corrects the variable name from "mute_led_nid" to "cap_mute_led_nid" in the function alc269_fixup_hp_cap_mic_mute_hook().

Considering that this is a simple typo fix and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions, it is likely safe to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch aims to turn off the voltage for thermistors by asking the MSIC (Multifunction System-on-Chip) to turn it off, instead of complaining about it being on.
   - The purpose is to save power.

2. Patch Changes:
   - Line 363: The code previously checked if the thermistor voltage was already set and issued a warning. This check is removed.
   - Lines 364-367: The patch updates the data variable by clearing the MSIC_ADCTHERM_MASK bit, effectively turning off the voltage for thermistors.
   - Lines 368-369: The updated data is written to the INTEL_MSIC_ADC1CNTL3 register using the intel_msic_reg_write() function.
   - If any of the above steps fail, the function returns an error.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses the issue of the thermistor voltage being turned on by directly instructing the MSIC to turn it off. This approach is more efficient and saves power.
   - The removal of the warning message indicates that the previous behavior was unnecessary and can be safely removed.
   - The patch is relatively small and focused, making it less likely to introduce new issues.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the mpl3115 driver in the iio subsystem. It ensures that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads by using claim/release helper functions.

2. The patch adds the necessary locking mechanism to prevent race conditions when checking for direct mode and performing raw reads.

3. The patch handles different channel types (pressure and temperature) and returns the appropriate values based on the channel type.

4. The patch also handles error conditions by returning the appropriate error codes and breaking out of the switch statement.

5. The patch includes proper sign-off from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-written and addresses a specific issue in the driver. It improves the reliability and correctness of the mpl3115 driver, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup error codes in hv.c." This suggests that it aims to improve error handling in the vmbus driver.

2. The patch includes changes to the `hv_post_message` function in the `hv.c` file.

3. In the original code, if the `payload_size` is greater than `HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT`, the function returns -1. This is not a descriptive error code and does not provide much information about the error.

4. The patch replaces the return value of -1 with the `EMSGSIZE` error code. `EMSGSIZE` is a standard error code defined in the Linux kernel and indicates that the message size is too large.

5. Similarly, the patch replaces the return value of -1 when `kmalloc` fails with the `ENOMEM` error code. `ENOMEM` is also a standard error code that indicates memory allocation failure.

6. The changes made in the patch improve the error reporting by using standard error codes, making it easier for developers and users to understand and handle errors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the error handling in the vmbus driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the potential problem of characters being dropped at close due to the missing implementation of chars_in_buffer in the sierra USB serial driver.

2. The patch adds the implementation of the sierra_chars_in_buffer function, which calculates the number of characters in the output buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBs (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

3. The implementation of sierra_chars_in_buffer is protected by a spin lock, ensuring thread safety.

4. The dev_dbg statement is added to provide debug information about the number of characters in the buffer.

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and the maintainer of the Linux kernel.

Overall, the patch appears to be a necessary fix for a potential data loss issue and follows the standard practices for kernel development. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple change to the "rx51_aux_dev" structure in the "rx51.c" file of the ASoC (Audio for System on Chip) subsystem. The patch changes the visibility of the "rx51_aux_dev" structure from global to static.

In general, making variables static is a good practice as it limits their visibility to the current file, reducing the risk of unintended access or modification from other parts of the codebase. This can help improve code maintainability and reduce potential bugs.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the efficiency of calculating averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

2. The patch introduces a new macro `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the number of intervals. In this case, `INTERVAL_SHIFT` is set to 3, which means `INTERVALS` will be equal to 8 (1UL << 3).

3. The `get_typical_interval` function is modified to use shifts instead of `do_div` when the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`. This optimization is possible because `INTERVALS` is a power of two.

4. Similarly, the standard deviation calculation in the `get_typical_interval` function is also modified to use shifts when the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`.

5. The patch improves the efficiency of the calculations by avoiding the use of `do_div` when the divisor is a power of two, which is usually the case.

Overall, the patch improves the performance of the cpuidle menu governor by using shifts instead of `do_div` when calculating averages and standard deviations. Since it is a performance optimization without any known negative side effects, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch adds a check for the auprobe->ops->pre_xol() hook and returns the error if it fails. This ensures that the task's state is not changed if the hook fails.

3. The patch also fixes the order of operations by setting the ip and flags values before modifying the trap_nr and blockstep flags.

4. The patch has been reviewed by Jim Keniston and has the Signed-off-by tag from Oleg Nesterov.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver.
2. Instead of using 'ai_continuous', the patch suggests determining the value from the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure.
3. The patch also removes the usage of 'ai_continuous' in the code logic, replacing it with the 'stop_src' check.

Reasoning:
1. The removal of 'ai_continuous' from the private data structure suggests that it is no longer necessary or used in the driver's functionality.
2. The patch introduces a more efficient way of determining the value of 'ai_continuous' by directly accessing the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure.
3. The removal of 'ai_continuous' and the usage of 'stop_src' simplifies the code logic and improves code readability.

Overall, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement to the code. It removes an unnecessary member and replaces it with a more efficient and direct approach. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch does not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of the function. It only improves code readability and maintainability.

Therefore, since the patch is a clean and straightforward improvement without any known negative side effects, it can be considered safe to include in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch enables support for the standard "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property in the opal rtc driver.

2. The patch adds support for the "wakeup-source" property, which indicates that the RTC can be used as a wakeup source.

3. The patch checks if the device has the "wakeup-source" property or the "has-tpo" property (legacy) in its device tree node. If either property is present, the device is marked as wakeup capable.

4. The patch updates the opal_rtc_ops to use the appropriate functions based on the presence of the "wakeup-source" property or the "has-tpo" property.

Overall, the patch adds support for the standard "wakeup-source" property while maintaining compatibility with the legacy "has-tpo" property. It ensures that the opal rtc driver can be used as a wakeup source. Therefore, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential issues or conflicts with other parts of the Linux kernel. A thorough review of the entire codebase is necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code" and mentions fixing up the powergating logic. This suggests that the patch aims to improve the power management functionality for the AMDGPU driver.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Ack-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The code changes in the patch modify the ci_dpm_powergate_uvd() function in the ci_dpm.c file. The changes introduce conditional powergating of the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block based on the "gate" parameter.

4. When "gate" is true, the UVD block is stopped and powergated using the amdgpu_set_powergating_state() function. Then, the ci_update_uvd_dpm() function is called with the "gate" parameter.

5. When "gate" is false, the UVD block is un-gated using the amdgpu_set_powergating_state() function. Again, the ci_update_uvd_dpm() function is called with the "gate" parameter.

6. The changes appear to be focused on improving the power management of the UVD block in the AMDGPU driver, which is a valuable enhancement for stability and performance.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to be well-structured and addresses a specific issue related to power management. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only renames the function, ensuring that the code remains functionally equivalent.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch is relatively small and isolated to the `r8192E_phy.c` file in the `rtl8192e` staging driver. This minimizes the risk of introducing unintended side effects or regressions.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a straightforward and low-risk change that improves code consistency. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `add_pcie_port()` to `dra7xx_add_pcie_port()`. This renaming is done to avoid collisions in the global namespace, as the function is specific to the dra7xx platform.

2. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The patch also includes an `Acked-by` tag from Kishon Vijay Abraham I, who is associated with the `drivers/pci/host/pci-dra7xx.c` file. This indicates that the changes have been reviewed and approved by someone familiar with the relevant code.

4. The patch modifies the `dra7xx_pcie_probe()` function to use the renamed function `dra7xx_add_pcie_port()` instead of the original `add_pcie_port()` function.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward renaming of a function to avoid naming conflicts. It has been reviewed and approved by relevant parties. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a function `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon` directory. This function allows forcing a performance level via sysfs.

2. The function takes two parameters: `rdev`, which is a pointer to the `radeon_device` structure, and `level`, which is an enum representing the forced performance level.

3. Inside the function, it retrieves the current power state and performance state of the device.

4. Depending on the `level` parameter, the function performs different actions:
   - If `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_HIGH`, it sets the enabled levels to 0 and the forced levels to 1.
   - If `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_LOW`, it sets the forced levels to 0 and the enabled levels to the maximum performance level count minus 1.
   - If `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_AUTO`, it sets both the forced levels and enabled levels to 0.

5. After setting the appropriate levels, the function updates the `forced_level` field in the `radeon_device` structure and returns 0 on success.

6. The patch also adds a declaration of the `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` function in the `radeon_asic.h` file.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It adds a useful function that allows forcing performance levels, which can be beneficial for certain use cases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new field "flags" to the structures "ceph_osd_req_op" and "ceph_osd_op" in the files "osd_client.h" and "rados.h" respectively. This field is used to encode the op flags for the Ceph OSD (Object Storage Device) operations.

2. The patch also includes the necessary changes in the "osd_client.c" file to encode the "flags" field when constructing the OSD request.

3. The patch has been reviewed by multiple individuals, including Sage Weil and Alex Elder, which adds credibility to its correctness.

4. The patch is relatively small and focused, making it less likely to introduce unintended side effects.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds an mmc-device for the mach-tx28 platform.

2. It includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the authors.

3. In the Kconfig file, the patch adds the "select MXS_HAVE_PLATFORM_MXS_MMC" option, which enables the MXS MMC platform support for the mach-tx28 platform.

4. In the mach-tx28.c file, the patch adds a struct mxs_mmc_platform_data variable named "tx28_mmc0_pdata" with some initialization values.

5. The patch modifies the tx28_stk5v3_init() function to call mx28_add_mxs_mmc() with the "tx28_mmc0_pdata" variable as an argument.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for the mmc-device on the mach-tx28 platform and includes the necessary changes in the Kconfig and mach-tx28.c files.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a section mismatch warning triggered by specific configurations (pnx8550-jbs_defconfig and pnx8550-stb810_defconfig). Section mismatches can lead to runtime issues and should be resolved.

2. The warning message indicates that the function `prom_getcmdline()` references the variable `arcs_cmdline`, which is marked as `__initdata`. However, `prom_getcmdline()` itself is not marked as `__init`, causing the section mismatch.

3. The patch adds the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function, ensuring that it is placed in the correct section during initialization.

4. The patch is signed-off by Ralf Baechle, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the section mismatch warning. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for properly handling errors in the hv_acpi_init() function in the Staging: hv: vmbus driver. Here is my analysis:

1. The patch adds error handling code after calling vmbus_bus_init(irq).
2. If vmbus_bus_init(irq) returns a non-zero value (indicating an error), the patch calls acpi_bus_unregister_driver(&vmbus_acpi_driver) to unregister the driver.
3. Finally, the patch returns the error code from vmbus_bus_init(irq).

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential error scenario and ensures proper cleanup by unregistering the driver if an error occurs during initialization.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential side effects or dependencies on other parts of the kernel. A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire kernel codebase is necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file of the hwmon subsystem. It fixes the warnings by using DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST and clamp_val to convert values and modifies other macros for consistency and code readability.

By using DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST and clamp_val, the patch ensures that the values are properly converted and clamped within the specified ranges. This improves the accuracy and reliability of temperature and fan speed calculations.

Additionally, modifying the macros for consistency and readability makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

Therefore, considering the improvements and fixes provided by the patch, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the file mm/zbud.c and replaces the usage of the function list_tail_entry() with list_last_entry(). The list_tail_entry() function is defined in list.h, so it is safe to replace it with list_last_entry().

The change is a simple code refactoring that improves code readability and maintainability. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. Therefore, it is considered a safe change to include in stable releases.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton, which adds credibility to its acceptance.

Overall, the patch is a minor improvement that does not introduce any risks or regressions. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid addition to the Linux kernel. The patch adds a vifs list to keep track of all the virtual interfaces associated with the hardware. This list will be used later for iterating through the vifs.

The patch includes changes in the `main.c` file of the `wl12xx` driver, as well as in the `wl12xx.h` header file. In `main.c`, the `wl12xx_init_vif_data` function initializes the `wlvif->list` using `INIT_LIST_HEAD`, and the `wl1271_op_add_interface` function adds the `wlvif` to the `wlvif_list` using `list_add`. Similarly, the `__wl1271_op_remove_interface` function removes the `wlvif` from the `wlvif_list` using `list_del`. In `wl12xx.h`, the `struct wl1271` is extended with a new member `wlvif_list`, and the `struct wl12xx_vif` is extended with a new member `list`. Additionally, a macro `wl12xx_for_each_wlvif` is defined to iterate through the `wlvif_list`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) to be included in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the OMAP4 clock data. This parameter is used to define the sddiv mask for the DPLL, which is a J-Type DPLL.

Given that this patch is adding a necessary parameter to the USB DPLL, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses the issue of deactivating an interface immediately on enumeration failure. This is important for maintaining system stability and preventing potential issues caused by a failed interface activation.

2. The patch includes error handling code that properly handles the failure cases. If the interface activation or enabling fails, the patch jumps to the appropriate error handling labels to deactivate the interface and add it to the interface list.

3. The patch is signed-off by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the `gb_svc_process_intf_hotplug` function in the `svc.c` file, which suggests that it is a targeted fix for a specific issue.

Overall, the patch appears to be a necessary fix for handling interface enumeration failures and includes proper error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an inconsistency in the mask defines for certain registers in the WM8900 codec driver.
2. The patch removes the bitwise NOT operation on the mask bits for WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_BCLK_MASK, WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_OPCLK_MASK, and WM8900_LRC_MASK.
3. The patch ensures that the mask defines correspond to the bit defines in the datasheet, making it less error-prone.
4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the patch improves the clarity and consistency of the mask defines in the WM8900 codec driver, which is beneficial for maintaining code quality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch modifies the `ti_abb_init_table` function in the `ti-abb-regulator.c` file.

2. The change replaces the hardcoded return value `-ENODEV` with the variable `num_entries`, which is the error value returned by the `of_property_count_u32_elems` function.

3. By propagating the actual error value, the patch provides more accurate information about the failure to the caller of `ti_abb_init_table`.

4. This change improves the error handling and makes the code more maintainable and flexible.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable improvement to the code, and it addresses a specific issue related to error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch suggests removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function of the `ux500_pcm.c` file in the ASoC subsystem. The reason given is that the driver never uses `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, so there is no need to set the data using `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Impact: We need to assess the impact of removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`. This function is responsible for setting the DMA configuration data for the given substream. If the driver does not use `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, it suggests that the DMA configuration data is not required. Therefore, removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` should not have any adverse impact on the functionality of the driver.

2. Code correctness: We should verify that removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` does not introduce any code correctness issues. From the provided patch, it seems that the call is not necessary, and removing it should not affect the correctness of the code.

3. Testing: It is important to ensure that the patch has been thoroughly tested to validate its correctness and verify that it does not introduce any regressions or issues.

Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more comprehensive analysis, including code review and testing, should be conducted before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the spin lock in the ramoops driver. Currently, the spin_lock_init() function is called before the kmalloc() function, which allocates memory for cxt->pstore.buf. If the memory allocation fails, there is no need to initialize the spin lock.

The patch moves the spin_lock_init() function call after the error checking for the memory allocation. This ensures that the spin lock is only initialized if the memory allocation is successful.

By making this change, the patch improves the code's efficiency and correctness by avoiding unnecessary spin lock initialization when memory allocation fails.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the log messages in the exynos_cpufreq_scale function to use the dev_err/info functions instead of pr_err/info functions. This change ensures that accurate log messages with the device name are displayed. Using dev_err/info functions is generally preferred when dealing with device-specific operations.

2. The patch adds a new member, "dev," to the exynos_dvfs_info structure. This member is used to store a reference to the device associated with the exynos_info structure. This reference is later used in the dev_err calls to provide the device-specific log messages.

3. The patch updates the error handling in the exynos_cpufreq_probe function to use dev_err instead of pr_err. This change ensures that the error messages include the device name.

Overall, the patch improves the accuracy of log messages by using the dev_err/info functions and provides device-specific error messages. These changes are beneficial for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing a resource management issue related to clock handling.

2. The use of `devm_clk_get()` is preferred over `clk_get()` in this context because it automatically manages the resource's lifecycle, eliminating the need for manual cleanup.

3. The patch modifies the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function, where it replaces the call to `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()`. This change ensures that the clock resource is properly managed and avoids potential resource leaks.

4. The patch also removes the call to `clk_put()` in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change is necessary because `devm_clk_get()` automatically handles the resource cleanup, making the explicit call to `clk_put()` redundant.

Overall, the patch improves resource management by using `devm_clk_get()` and removes unnecessary cleanup code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This is done because these functions are not used outside of this file. 

Additionally, the patch resolves the warning messages related to missing prototypes for these functions. 

Overall, marking these functions as static improves code organization and eliminates warnings, making it a suitable change for inclusion in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the beginning of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the subsequent ring count validations are only performed if the interrupt mode is MSI-X. This is a valid optimization as there is no need to validate ring counts if they are not going to change.

2. If the interrupt mode is not MSI-X, the function returns with an error, indicating that there is no RSS/TSS support in non-MSI-X mode. This is a reasonable behavior as the subsequent ring count validations are not applicable in this case.

3. The patch modifies the validation for the RX and TX ring counts. Instead of validating if the ring count is non-zero, it now checks if the ring count has changed from the current driver configuration. This optimization avoids unnecessary validations when the ring count has not changed.

4. The `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function in `qlcnic_main.c` is no longer used for checking the interrupt mode. The checks for non-MSI and MSI modes have been removed. This is acceptable as the interrupt mode check is now performed at the beginning of `qlcnic_set_channels()`.

Overall, the patch optimizes the ring count validations and improves the efficiency of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the recommended function comedi_buf_write_samples() and properly handling the sample value. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to select only devices with active links when looking for or validating a user device in the staging/rdma/hfi1 driver. The patch introduces a new function `usable_device` that checks if the device is available for general use by verifying if the driver link state is `IB_PORT_ACTIVE`. 

The patch then modifies the `get_user_context` function to iterate through the available devices and only consider devices that are not NULL, have an active link, and have free contexts. Additionally, the `find_shared_ctxt` function is modified to skip devices that are not present or do not have a valid kernel register base.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a necessary improvement to ensure that only devices with active links are selected for user device operations. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. Impact on code readability: Making a function inline can sometimes make the code harder to read and understand, especially if the function is complex or has a significant amount of code. It is important to assess whether the inline modification improves or hinders code readability.

2. Code size impact: Inlining a function can increase the size of the resulting binary, as the function code is duplicated at each call site. This can be a concern for systems with limited memory or storage. It is necessary to evaluate whether the increase in code size is acceptable.

3. Performance improvement: The patch claims to make the function inline, which can potentially improve performance by reducing function call overhead. However, it is crucial to verify whether the function is a performance bottleneck and whether inlining it provides a noticeable performance improvement.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision without further context and analysis. However, if the function is relatively simple and the inline modification does not significantly impact code readability or code size, it is likely that this patch could be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is correct and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is adding two calls to `rtnl_unlock()` in the `enic_change_mtu_work()` function. These calls are added in the error paths where the RQ (Receive Queue) is disabled or when receive buffers cannot be allocated.

By calling `rtnl_unlock()` in these error paths, the patch ensures that the rtnl_lock is released properly before returning from the function. This is important to avoid potential deadlocks or inconsistent state when an error occurs.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and Cc tags for proper attribution and notification to the relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch seems to address a potential issue and improves the error handling in the `enic_change_mtu_work()` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch adds a check to ensure that I2S mode always uses stereo clocking, even for mono data.
2. It reads the current value of the AIF_FORMAT register.
3. If the number of channels in the audio parameters is 1 and the AIF1_FMT_MASK bit is set in the AIF_FORMAT register, it forces stereo mode by doubling the bclk_target value.
4. The patch then proceeds with the existing logic to select the appropriate bclk_target value based on the available rates.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch ensures that I2S mode always uses stereo clocking, which is required even for mono data. This fix improves the correctness and reliability of the audio subsystem in the Linux kernel.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new debugfs entry called "amdgpu_gca_config" to the amdgpu_device.c file. Debugfs entries are used for debugging and monitoring purposes, and adding new entries can be beneficial for developers and users.

2. The implementation of the "amdgpu_debugfs_gca_config_read" function reads GCA configuration data from the amdgpu_device structure and stores it in the "config" array. This data is then copied to the user buffer in chunks of 4 bytes.

3. The "config" array is allocated using kmalloc with a size of 256 * sizeof(*config) bytes. This allocation is done in the kernel's memory context (GFP_KERNEL), which is appropriate for kernel allocations.

4. The "config" array is populated with various configuration values from the amdgpu_device structure. These values represent different aspects of the GCA configuration.

5. The function performs necessary checks on the size and position parameters to ensure proper alignment and validity of the user buffer.

6. The "config" array is freed using kfree after the data has been copied to the user buffer.

7. The patch also adds the "amdgpu_debugfs_gca_config_fops" structure, which defines the file operations for the "amdgpu_gca_config" debugfs entry.

8. The "amdgpu_debugfs_gca_config_fops" structure is added to the "debugfs_regs" array, which is used to register the debugfs entries.

Overall, the patch adds a new debugfs entry that provides GCA configuration data to users. The implementation appears to be correct and follows the existing pattern for other debugfs entries in the file. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug where the functions v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() are currently only called when the last user closes the device and the device is already disconnected. However, it is necessary to call these functions whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

The patch correctly moves the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() to the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function, which is called when the em28xx-v4l extension is closed. This ensures that the functions are called whenever the extension is closed, regardless of the device's connection status.

Additionally, the patch updates the warning message in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function to reflect that memory deallocation is deferred on the last close, rather than deregistration.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and improves the behavior of the em28xx-v4l extension. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the "spi_master" transfer_one callback returns a positive value, which is not considered an error. However, without setting "ret" to 0 in this case, the code hits an error when the transfer_one callback returns 1.

The patch modifies the code to set "ret" to 0 when "master->transfer_one" returns a positive value. This ensures that the transfer is not considered a failure and prevents the error message from being triggered.

The change seems reasonable and does not introduce any new issues. It only handles the case where "transfer_one" returns a positive value, ensuring that the transfer is treated as successful. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `__auxtrace_mmap__read` function in `tools/perf/util/auxtrace.c` and adds a new field `alignment` to the `struct auxtrace_record` in `tools/perf/util/auxtrace.h`.

The purpose of this patch is to allow auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size. This is necessary for certain cases, such as BTS (Branch Trace Store), where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

The patch checks if `itr->alignment` is set and adjusts the length and size of the data accordingly. It subtracts the unwanted bytes from `len1` and `size` to ensure the data is aligned properly.

By allowing auxtrace data alignment to be configurable, this patch improves the flexibility and compatibility of the perf tools. It addresses a specific use case and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a bug in the Bluetooth module's update_scan_rsp_data() function. The function is supposed to operate on the scan_rsp_data_len and scan_rsp_data variables, but it mistakenly operates on the adv_data_len and adv_data variables instead.

The patch corrects this by updating the correct variables: hdev->scan_rsp_data_len and hdev->scan_rsp_data. It also updates the comparison condition to check if hdev->scan_rsp_data_len is equal to len and if the memory contents of cp.data and hdev->scan_rsp_data are the same.

The patch then copies the contents of cp.data to hdev->scan_rsp_data and updates hdev->scan_rsp_data_len with the length of the data.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue by correctly updating the scan response data variables and ensures that the correct comparison is made. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The change from `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` is a more consistent and appropriate approach for logging warnings related to network devices.

3. The patch includes a comment stating that one occurrence of `pr_warn` is left intact as it is unrelated to `net_device`. This indicates that the patch has been carefully reviewed and only relevant changes have been made.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including Veaceslav Falico, David S. Miller, Jay Vosburgh, and Andy Gospodarek. This indicates that the patch has undergone a thorough review process.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch is a valid improvement to the code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is constifying the "exynos_drm_crtc_ops" structures in the "exynos5433_drm_decon.c" file. The purpose of this change is to declare these structures as const since they are only passed as an argument to the function "exynos_drm_crtc_create", which expects a const struct pointer.

The patch modifies the "decon_crtc_ops" structure by adding the "const" qualifier to it. This change ensures that the structure is treated as read-only and cannot be modified within the function.

Considering the nature of the change and the provided rationale, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The constification of the structures improves code clarity and helps prevent accidental modifications.

However, it is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough review of the code and testing may be necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a precedence issue in setting the `mask_pos` variable in the `msi_capability_init` function of the `msi.c` file in the PCI driver. The original code incorrectly assigns `PCI_MSI_MASK_64` to `mask_pos` when the `control` variable has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set.

The patch fixes this issue by using proper parentheses to ensure the correct precedence of the `+` and `?:` operators. It explicitly checks the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag and assigns the appropriate value to `mask_pos` accordingly.

The change in the patch is straightforward and addresses a bug introduced in a previous commit. It does not introduce any new functionality or risk of regressions. Therefore, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any broader context or potential interactions with other parts of the kernel.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to convert the usage of the "should_stop" variable into the kthread_should_stop() API. This API is used to check if a kernel thread should stop execution. By using this API, the code becomes more standardized and easier to maintain.

The patch modifies the code in the virthba.c file, specifically in the process_incoming_rsps() function. It adds a check using the kthread_should_stop() API before the existing break statement. This ensures that the thread will exit if it is requested to stop.

The removal of the "should_stop" variable and the associated check simplifies the code and makes it more readable. It also aligns with the recommended practice of using the kthread_should_stop() API for thread termination checks.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT (Device Tree) data, which eliminates the need to add most of the clock aliases under drivers/clk/ti/clk-xyz.c files. This suggests that the patch improves the efficiency and maintainability of the code.

2. The patch includes changes to the _add_clkdev() function in omap_device.c. It first attempts to get the clock using clk_get_sys() and if that fails and the DT has been populated, it uses of_clk_get_from_provider() to retrieve the clock. This indicates that the patch handles different scenarios and ensures compatibility with DT-based systems.

3. The patch registers the clock device using clk_register_clkdev() if the clock retrieval is successful, or falls back to clk_add_alias() if not. This ensures that the clock alias is properly registered with the device.

4. The patch includes proper error handling, as it checks for -ENODEV and -ENOMEM return codes and logs appropriate error messages.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-implemented and addresses the goal of creating clock aliases purely from DT data. It also handles different scenarios and includes proper error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes the return value of the `efivarfs_file_write()` function in the `efivars.c` file. Currently, the function returns a `ssize_t` type, which is a signed integer, but the variable `bytes` is of type `size_t`, which is an unsigned integer. Although both types should have the same number of bits, it is safer to have consistent signedness to avoid potential sign issues.

The patch introduces a new variable `bytes` of type `ssize_t` and initializes it to 0. This variable is then used to store the return value of the function instead of the `count` variable.

In the error handling paths, the patch updates the assignments to `count` to assign the appropriate error codes to `bytes`. This ensures that the correct error code is returned to the caller.

Finally, the patch assigns the value of `count` to `bytes` before returning it. This ensures that the correct number of bytes written is returned to the caller.

Overall, the patch addresses the sign issue and improves the accuracy of the return value. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses issues related to newer versions of gcc when dealing with variable-sized arrays in structs. It suggests using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays. The patch includes changes to the sumo_parse_power_table() function in the sumo_dpm.c file.

The changes involve introducing a new variable, "idx," which is a pointer to the clockInfoIndex array. Instead of directly accessing the array using indexing, the patch uses pointer arithmetic to access the elements. This change ensures compatibility with newer versions of gcc.

The patch also updates the calculation of the clock_info pointer using the new "idx" variable. It correctly calculates the offset based on the index and the size of each entry in the clock_info_array.

The patch includes a reference to three bug reports related to the issue, indicating that it addresses known problems.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable solution to the problem and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" member outside the "mesh_stats" debug group. This change is made because "estab_plinks" is not a statistics member and should not be displayed along with other mesh stat members.

2. The patch adds the "estab_plinks" debugfs attribute to the "add_mesh_files" function, with a mode of 0400. This allows the "estab_plinks" attribute to be accessed in debugfs.

3. The patch removes the "estab_plinks" member from the "add_mesh_stats" function. This is consistent with the change made in step 1, where "estab_plinks" is no longer considered a mesh stat member.

Overall, the patch seems to be making necessary changes to correctly handle the "estab_plinks" member in the mesh_stats debug group. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix for a sparse warning. The patch declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static, which resolves the "symbol was not declared" warning.

The patch modifies the gk20a_instmem structure in the gk20a.c file of the nouveau driver. It adds a new member variable called iommu_bit of type u16. This variable is used to store the IOMMU bit specified in the platform data.

In the gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu function, the patch replaces the hardcoded bit 34 with the iommu_bit variable to clear the IOMMU bit and unmap pages.

Similarly, in the gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu function, the patch replaces the hardcoded bit 34 with the iommu_bit variable to set the IOMMU bit and resolve addresses through the IOMMU.

Finally, in the gk20a_instmem_new function, the patch assigns the iommu_bit value from the platform data to the iommu_bit member variable.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the flexibility and maintainability of the code by using the IOMMU bit specified in the platform data instead of hardcoding it. This change allows for easier configuration and adaptation to different Tegra GPUs.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch proposes collecting the ACRS/FPRS registers before saving them, ensuring that the saved values are up-to-date.
4. The patch also mentions that this fix resolves strange problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw, as the low-level machine check handler will revalidate all registers with the content of the save area.
5. The patch is signed-off by the author and includes the necessary CC and Signed-off-by tags.

Considering the provided information, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch and its description, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to probing with a glob, where errors in `add_probe_trace_event()` are not passed to `debuginfo__find_trace_events()`. This can lead to a segmentation fault if perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob.

2. The patch ensures that `add_probe_trace_event()` does not modify `tf->ntevs` and `tf->tevs` if the function fails. This prevents potential issues and maintains the integrity of the data structures.

3. The patch includes a clear description of the problem and the solution it provides.

4. It has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, indicating that it has been successfully tested.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function of `checkpoint.c`. This ensures that the `s_dirty` flag is checked and the checkpoint is skipped if it is not set. This change improves the correctness of the code.

2. The previous condition was incorrect as it did not consider the scenario where a checkpoint was already done and all the node pages were written back. The patch addresses this issue by introducing the check for `s_dirty` before proceeding with the checkpoint.

3. The `write_checkpoint` function is responsible for performing the necessary block operations and then calling `do_checkpoint` to write the checkpoint. The patch ensures that the checkpoint is only performed if `s_dirty` is set, improving efficiency.

4. In `f2fs_sync_fs` function of `super.c`, the patch removes the unnecessary check for `s_dirty` and `get_pages` before returning 0. This change simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary checks when syncing the filesystem.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness and efficiency of the code by checking `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` and removing unnecessary checks in `f2fs_sync_fs`. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to reduce the memory footprint for debugging in the DRM Radeon driver. It suggests replacing the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() with a kernel helper function, printk(), to dump up to 64 bytes. In this case, the actual size being dumped is 15 bytes.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:
- The hex_dump_to_buffer() function call is removed.
- The DRM_DEBUG_KMS macro is modified to use the %*ph format specifier, which allows printing a buffer of a specified length in hexadecimal format.

The rationale behind this change is that using printk() with the %*ph format specifier is more efficient and reduces memory usage compared to hex_dump_to_buffer().

Considering the patch's purpose and the changes made, it appears to be a valid optimization that reduces memory usage without affecting functionality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes unused return smatch warnings in the tcmu_netlink_event function in drivers/target/target_core_user.c.

2. The patch initializes the "ret" variable to -ENOMEM, which is the error code for out-of-memory conditions.

3. The patch checks if genlmsg_new fails to allocate a new sk_buff and returns the initialized "ret" value (-ENOMEM) instead of -ENOMEM directly.

4. The patch checks if genlmsg_put fails to allocate space for the message header and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

5. The patch uses nla_put_string and nla_put_u32 to add attributes to the skb. If any of these functions fail, the patch jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value.

6. The patch checks if genlmsg_end fails to finalize the message and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value.

7. If all the operations are successful, the patch calls genlmsg_multicast to send the skb and returns the "ret" value (0) if the multicast succeeds.

8. If any of the operations fail, the patch frees the sk_buff and returns the "ret" value.

The patch addresses the unused return smatch warnings and handles error conditions properly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the S25FL127S nor flash part where writing to the configuration register takes a significant amount of time. During this time, no further accesses to the flash should be made, including reads. The patch adds a wait loop after the register writing to ensure that the flash finishes its work before proceeding.

This issue could lead to rootfs mounting failures if the quad enable bit setting step is done too closely to the mounting process. In such cases, filesystem recovery attempts by drivers like UBIFS may result in complete filesystem breakage.

The patch includes error handling code that checks for a timeout while writing the configuration register and returns an error if it occurs. Additionally, it performs a read-back and check of the configuration register to ensure that the quad enable bit is properly set.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to flash access timing and provides necessary error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses an issue where the badness score of a thread can overflow if the privileges given to root threads or the value of /proc/pid/oom_score_adj exceed the amount of resident set size (rss) of the thread. This issue was introduced by a previous commit.

The patch fixes this issue by changing the type of the 'points' variable to 'long' and returning 1 if the value is negative, indicating that the thread is still eligible for kill.

The patch also includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, acknowledged, and signed-off on the patch.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a clear fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the kvm_vm_ioctl_register_coalesced_mmio() function. Currently, if kvm_io_bus_register_dev() fails, it returns success (0) instead of an error code. The patch corrects this behavior by returning the actual error code (ret) instead of a fixed value (0).

2. The patch also removes an unnecessary NULL test for the 'dev' variable before freeing it. Since the 'dev' variable is assigned a non-NULL value earlier in the code, the NULL test is impossible and can be safely removed.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by commit 2b3c246a682c.

4. The patch is relatively small and focused, making it less likely to introduce new issues or regressions.

1. The patch fixes an issue with the VLAN_TAG_PRESENT in the netvsc_recv_callback() function in the netvsc_drv.c file.

2. The issue is that __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() is being called unconditionally, which adds VLAN_TAG_PRESENT to all packets, regardless of whether they come from a VLAN or not.

3. The patch adds a check to only call __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() if the packet's VLAN_TAG_PRESENT flag is set (packet->vlan_tci & VLAN_TAG_PRESENT).

4. The patch includes a Reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Olaf Hering, and Signed-off-by tags from Haiyang Zhang and David S. Miller.

5. The patch also includes a Reviewed-by tag from K. Y. Srinivasan, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a use-after-free issue in the TIOCMIWAIT functionality of the quatech2 USB serial driver. This is an important fix as use-after-free bugs can lead to crashes or other security vulnerabilities.

2. The patch introduces a check for the serial disconnected flag before accessing private port data after waking up. This ensures that the private port data, including the wait queue, is still valid after a disconnect event.

3. The patch removes the declaration and initialization of the "delta_msr_wait" wait queue from the "struct qt2_port_private" structure. This is because the wait queue is now accessed through the "port" structure instead.

4. The patch modifies the wait_event_interruptible call to use "port->delta_msr_wait" instead of "priv->delta_msr_wait". This ensures that the correct wait queue is used for waiting on modem status changes.

5. The patch adds a check for the "disconnected" flag in the wait loop. If the serial device is disconnected, the function returns with an error code (-EIO). This prevents accessing invalid data when the device is disconnected.

6. The patch modifies the wake_up_interruptible call to use "&port->delta_msr_wait" instead of "&port_priv->delta_msr_wait". This ensures that the correct wait queue is woken up when there are modem status changes.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue, improves the handling of the wait queue, and ensures that the private port data is accessed safely. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an overflow condition in the pool_find_page() function of the dmapool module. When a DMA pool lies at the very top of the dma_addr_t range, the calculated end address of the pool wraps around to zero, causing page lookup to always fail.

The patch modifies the calculation in the if statement from "dma < (page->dma + pool->allocation)" to "(dma - page->dma) < pool->allocation". This change ensures that the subtraction is performed before the comparison, making it overflow-proof.

By making this adjustment, the patch resolves the issue of page lookup failure when a DMA pool is at the top of the dma_addr_t range.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton. It also includes relevant Cc's to individuals who may have expertise in the affected areas.

2. The patch adds a call to debug_ll_io_init() early in the exynos_init_io() function to avoid the hang.
3. The issue can be reliably reproduced without the patch by adding flush_tlb_all() at the start of exynos_init_io(), and the hang is resolved after applying the patch.
4. The patch has been signed-off by Doug Anderson and Acked-by Kukjin Kim, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.
5. The patch is relatively small and focused, addressing a specific issue without introducing any significant changes or potential regressions.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a bug that exists since the preallocation was introduced in commit 9d7730914f4cd496e356acfab95b41075aa8eae8. It explains that in rare cases, the entire ring can be filled without emitting a request, leading to a flushed and waited upon outstanding request. However, after clearing space on the ring, the seqno allocated for the operation is cleared, triggering a sanity check failure.

To fix this issue, the patch suggests rearranging the code to ensure that the allocation of the seqno for the operation occurs after any required flushes of outstanding operations. It introduces a new function called "__intel_ring_prepare" that handles the preparation of the ring before allocating the seqno.

The patch has been signed-off by the author and reviewed by other relevant individuals. It also includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags.

Based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the bug and improve the stability of the system.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch ensures that when detaching a userspace context, any mapped MMIO regions are properly unmapped. This prevents userspace contexts from accessing the Problem State Area MMIO region after detaching.

Considering the importance of preventing unauthorized access and the potential impact on system stability, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for a NULL context in the function `mmc_cd_gpio_free()`. This check ensures that the function does not cause an oops if it is mistakenly called on a driver cleanup path, even if a previous call to `mmc_cd_gpio_request()` failed. This is a defensive programming measure to prevent potential issues.

2. The patch includes a `Signed-off-by` line from the author, Guennadi Liakhovetski, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch is signed-off by Amir Vadai <amirv@mellanox.com> and David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue described and does not introduce any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to address an issue related to an unhandled fault caused by accessing MUSB's memory space while its clock is turned off due to pm_runtime kicking in. The patch encloses the musb_gadget_pullup() function with pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put() calls to ensure that the path is always reached with the clock turned on.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch extends the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board connector quirk to cover a newer silicon stepping with a new PCI ID. The purpose of this quirk is to correctly mark the back plane connectors.

Considering the information provided, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. The patch adds support for a new silicon stepping and ensures correct functionality for the affected board. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend a (B) NAK, meaning that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to allow multiple stacks in applications without truncating callchains. It disables the check for the frame pointer (fp) being less than the stack pointer (RSP) in the perf_callchain_user32 and perf_callchain_user functions.

However, the patch does not provide sufficient justification for disabling this check. It mentions that GDB shows proper stack traces and frame pointer chaining is intact, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or explanation for why this check is unnecessary.

Additionally, the patch mentions that in limited testing, it did not seem to break anything. However, this is not a strong enough argument to justify the change, as it does not guarantee that the patch will not cause issues in other scenarios or with different configurations.

In the long term, the patch suggests potentially having userspace advise the kernel on the range of valid stack addresses. While this may be a valid approach, it is not implemented in this patch and does not provide a strong enough justification for disabling the check.

Overall, without more concrete evidence and justification, it is safer to reject this patch from being included in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a return value check in the usbhs_mod_gadget_probe() function in the renesas_usbhs driver. The current code checks if the return value of usb_get_phy() is NULL, but it should actually use IS_ERR() to check for an error condition.

The patch correctly replaces the NULL test with !IS_ERR() to handle the error case properly. It also includes the Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit.

Additionally, the patch has been Acked-by Yoshihiro Shimoda and signed-off by Wei Yongjun and Felipe Balbi, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix a deadlock caused by a race condition between relocation in the Btrfs file system. The patch modifies the `create_pending_snapshot` function in `fs/btrfs/transaction.c` to use `btrfs_block_rsv_add_noflush` instead of `btrfs_block_rsv_add` when adding block reservations.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact impact and potential risks associated with this patch. However, based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to consider accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a known issue and provides a fix to prevent deadlocks in the Btrfs file system.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning in the of_free_opp_table() function. It addresses the issue of splatting a warning when OPP (Operating Performance Points) is not defined for a device. This is a valid fix as not having OPP defined for a device should not trigger a warning.

2. The patch also handles the case where find_device_opp() returns an error pointer (-EINVAL). Instead of crashing in dev_name(), it checks if the error is -ENODEV and returns without any further action. This is a reasonable approach to prevent crashes and handle invalid devices gracefully.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and an Acked-by from another contributor, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned warning and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a regression introduced by commit 027bd7e89906. The regression causes failed XS_TRANSACTION_START messages to leave the transaction open, which can lead to problems with suspend and migration.

The patch removes the accidental change that caused the regression, specifically the early return statement when ret is an error. By removing this early return, the code will correctly handle failed XS_TRANSACTION_START messages and ensure that the transaction is closed.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a regression and improves the stability and functionality of the xenbus module.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new software pte flag, L_PTE_NONE, which is set to identify faulting, present entries. This flag helps to differentiate PROT_NONE mappings from other types of mappings.

2. The patch modifies the existing definitions of L_PTE_NONE in the ARM architecture-specific header files (arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable-2level.h, arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable-3level.h, and arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable.h). It adds L_PTE_NONE to the existing flags, such as L_PTE_XN and L_PTE_RDONLY, to define the PAGE_NONE protection attribute.

3. The patch also modifies the __PAGE_NONE definition in arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable.h to include the L_PTE_NONE flag.

4. In the assembly code files (arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S, arch/arm/mm/proc-v7-2level.S, and arch/arm/mm/proc-v7-3level.S), the patch adds checks for the L_PTE_NONE flag when setting or modifying page table entries. These checks ensure that the L_PTE_NONE flag is handled correctly in the ARM architecture-specific code.

Overall, this patch addresses a vulnerability where PROT_NONE pages can be read by the kernel on systems without support for domains. By introducing the L_PTE_NONE flag and modifying the relevant code, the patch ensures that faulting, present entries for PROT_NONE mappings are properly identified and handled.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch and the explanation, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug in the time interval calculation in the ratelimit code. The current implementation sets the `begin` value to 0 when `rs->interval` is passed, which leads to improper suppression and incorrect behavior.

The proposed fix suggests setting `begin` to `jiffies` instead of 0 to properly reset the interval. This change ensures that the time interval check works correctly and `rs->printed` is initialized appropriately.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and improves the functionality of the ratelimit code.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the behavior of the UDP error handler in both IPv4 and IPv6.
2. In the IPv4 section, the patch changes the handling of ICMP redirects. Instead of breaking out of the switch statement, it now uses a "goto out" statement. This means that the error handler will exit without touching the socket, as intended.
3. In the IPv6 section, the patch also modifies the handling of NDISC redirects. Similar to the IPv4 section, it uses a "goto out" statement to exit the error handler without touching the socket.
4. The changes in both sections align with the intention of not treating redirects as error conditions and avoiding unnecessary socket handling.

Overall, the patch appears to address the issue correctly and improves the behavior of the UDP error handler. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the paging_init() function where the detection of unsupported highmem with cache aliases is ineffective. The code is currently run before the caches are probed, causing the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro to always evaluate to false. This leads to coherency issues or triggering a BUG_ON in flush_kernel_dcache_page().

The patch fixes this by running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(), ensuring that cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates correctly and the unsupported highmem case is detected successfully.

Additionally, the patch addresses a hidden issue in mem_init_free_highmem() where it attempts to free all highmem pages, even though they are not being used and don't have valid page structs. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception. The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates to true, avoiding the issue.

The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors and has received appropriate review and testing. It also includes relevant Cc's to ensure proper communication and visibility.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a bug where a memory error on a hugepage can cause a VM_BUG_ON error in get_page(). The bug occurs because the coredump-related code does not recognize the "hugepage hwpoison entry" when a memory error occurs on a hugepage. This results in follow_hugetlb_page() returning the wrong page from a given address.

The patch introduces a check in follow_hugetlb_page() to handle the different bit layout between the hugepage hwpoison entry and pmd entry. This allows for proper handling of hugetlb_fault() and taking appropriate actions, such as waiting for migration entries and failing with VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE for hwpoisoned entries. As a result, all hugepages can be dumped except for the hwpoisoned ones.

The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Michal Hocko, KOSAKI Motohiro, and David Rientjes. It also has a signed-off-by from Naoya Horiguchi, the patch author.

The patch states that enabling the new link protections by default has caused issues with some applications and has broken the way AFD distributes files. As a result, the patch suggests reverting to the legacy behavior to avoid breaking existing systems.

Considering the goal of stable releases is to ensure the reliability and compatibility of the Linux kernel, it would be reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). By reverting to the legacy behavior, it aims to prevent any further disruptions to existing systems and applications.

However, it is important to note that this decision is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough analysis, including testing and consideration of potential security implications, would be necessary before finalizing the decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a possible race condition in mlx5_core_destroy_mkey() function. It ensures that the mr is first removed from the radix tree and then destroyed, preventing a race if the key was reallocated and attempted to be inserted into the radix tree.

2. The patch also handles radix tree insert/delete failures. If the radix tree insert fails, it logs a warning message, destroys the mr, and returns the error.

3. In mlx5_core_destroy_mkey(), the patch adds a check to verify if the mr was successfully deleted from the radix tree. If the deletion fails, it logs a warning message, returns -ENOENT (indicating the entry was not found), and does not proceed with destroying the mkey.

4. The patch removes the redundant radix_tree_delete() call after mlx5_cmd_exec(). This call was already performed earlier, and removing it avoids unnecessary operations.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by commit a544c619a54b, which added delayed work for querying (setting the mode) on all tablets.
2. The issue specifically affects the Bamboo Touch (056a:00d0) device, which has a ghost interface claiming to be a pen device.
3. The patch cancels the delayed work and calls the _wacom_query_tablet_data() function to set the mode on the ghost pen interface before removing it.
4. The patch ensures that the mode setting is executed before the device is removed, resolving the problem caused by the delayed work introduced in the previous commit.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a missing spinlock initialization in the aq_ring structure in the Aquantia Ethernet driver. The patch adds the necessary spin_lock_init() call to initialize the lock.

Considering that the patch fixes a bug and adds necessary initialization, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch disables the RHWO (Render Hang Workaround Optimization) optimization for gen7 in the i915 driver. This is done by setting bits 10 and 26 in the GEN7_COMMON_SLICE_CHICKEN1 register to avoid 3D ring hangs.

2. The patch includes references to two Bugzilla entries (Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41353 and Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44610), indicating that this patch addresses specific issues related to GPU hangs.

3. The patch also includes a "Tested-by" tag from Eugeni Dodonov, indicating that the patch has been tested by the mentioned individual.

4. The patch is signed-off by Kenneth Graunke and Jesse Barnes, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses known issues related to GPU hangs and has been tested. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses an out-of-bounds access issue in the ffs_func_eps_enable() function of the f_fs.c file in the USB gadget driver. The issue occurs when accessing the companion descriptor for SuperSpeed endpoints.

The patch checks if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. If the gadget is not SuperSpeed, the companion descriptor is not allocated, and accessing it would result in an out-of-bounds access.

Considering that the patch fixes a bug that can lead to a kernel crash and has been tested on the Rockchip platform, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Explanation:
The patch description states that the check of the return value from __find_format() was inverted by mistake. However, the actual patch code does not fix the mistake. 

In the original code, if the format is not found (format is NULL), the patch sets ret to -EINVAL. However, in the patch, the condition is inverted, so if the format is found (format is not NULL), it assigns the format to fmt->format. This is incorrect and does not fix the original mistake.

Therefore, the patch does not address the issue correctly and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes a useless BUG_ON statement that caused a regression in the 3.5 kernel version.
2. The regression was introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16, which removed the list of pinned inactive objects.
3. The crash occurs in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl() function, specifically at line 3661, where the BUG_ON(!list_empty(&dev_priv->mm.inactive_list)) check is made.
4. According to Chris, the BUG_ON check is unnecessary and can be safely removed. The checks are a crude approximation and are too late to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state.
5. Removing the BUG_ON statement will not introduce any new issues and will address the regression caused by the previous commit.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the regression and improve the stability of the kernel.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is described as a hotfix for version 3.19, indicating that it addresses a specific issue in that version.
2. The patch explains that the Xen pciback driver assumes that pci_dev->irq won't change after calling pci_disable_device(). However, a previous commit reset pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called.
3. The patch aims to avoid resetting pci_dev->irq in order to maintain compatibility with the Xen pciback driver.
4. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been tested by Sander Eikelenboom.
5. It includes relevant Cc's to individuals who may have an interest or expertise in the affected code.
6. The patch provides a link to the original discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) for further reference.
7. The patch is signed-off by Thomas Gleixner, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted source.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue, has been tested, and has received appropriate review and sign-off. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the need_this_block() function in the md/raid5 driver. It limits the loop iterations to a maximum of 2 when iterating over the failed devices. This change ensures that the function does not attempt to index beyond the end of the failed_num[] and fdev[] arrays.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Shaohua Li. It also includes a signed-off-by tag from NeilBrown, who is a known contributor to the Linux kernel.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential out-of-bounds access issue on non-DeviceTree (DT) platforms. This issue occurs when the index of the serial device is incremented even if a deferred probe happens during the clock retrieval in s3c24xx_serial_init_port().

2. The index is used to reference elements of the statically allocated s3c24xx_serial_ports array. If a re-probe occurs, the index will point outside of this array, leading to memory corruption.

3. The patch fixes the issue by incrementing the index only on a successful probe, ensuring that it remains within the bounds of the array.

4. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz.

5. The patch also includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the split of the serial driver into core and per-cpu drivers.

6. The patch is signed-off by the author, Krzysztof Kozlowski, and the maintainer, Greg Kroah-Hartman.

7. The patch modifies the s3c24xx_serial_probe() function by moving the probe_index incrementation after the cpufreq notifier addition.

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and follows the necessary conventions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a recursive locking bug introduced in the commit 9ec1882df2, which can cause issues with the kernel debugging facilities and prevent printks from surfacing on the serial console.

2. The patch proposes a solution to avoid locking in the sysrq case and use trylock in the oops_in_progress case, which helps prevent being stuck on the lock during kernel crashes.

3. The patch also identifies an issue with the current scheme used in other drivers, where console writes happen unlocked as long as port->sysrq is not reset. It suggests a separate indicator (port->sysrq_cpu) to handle this issue and provides a modified locking check.

4. The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander and signed-off by Thomas Gleixner and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the recursive locking bug and improve the handling of console writes in the affected drivers.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is addressing a race condition in the netfilter nf_ct_h323 module. The current implementation of mod_timer in the code introduces a race condition where memory that has already been freed can be accessed when the timer expires again.

The proposed fix suggests replacing mod_timer with mod_timer_pending to resolve this issue. mod_timer_pending is a safer alternative that ensures the timer is not reactivated if it has already expired.

Considering the potential memory access issue and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a memory leak issue that occurs during the suspend/resume process in the stmmac driver. Currently, the driver reallocates all resources during the resume step but fails to release them during suspend. The patch proposes a change in logic to avoid freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch. Instead, it suggests reinitializing the descriptors and the rx/tx pointers only during resume.

The patch has been tested on STi boxes, and it has been reported by ZhengShunQian <zhengsq@rock-chips.com>. It is also signed-off by Giuseppe Cavallaro <peppe.cavallaro@st.com> and David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>.

The changes made in the patch seem reasonable and targeted towards fixing the memory leak issue. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or significant changes, but rather improves resource management during the suspend/resume process.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for passing beacons from foreign APs in AP mode. This is necessary to properly set the ht protection IE. This change seems reasonable and relevant for maintaining stability and compatibility.

2. The patch also adds the same filters for passing probe requests and beacons from other APs in GO mode. This appears to be a fix for a mistake where GO mode didn't have any configured filter_flags. This change ensures consistency and correctness in both AP and GO modes.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Eliad Peller and Emmanuel Grumbach, who are associated with Intel. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the relevant stakeholders.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue and provides a necessary fix. It does not introduce any obvious risks or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm implementation in the TCP stack. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes than necessary, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

The patch modifies the code to ensure that F-RTO probes are sent at most once, as specified in the RFC 5682. It checks if the next ACK advances SND_UNA (the next sequence number expected to be acknowledged) and does not sack a new packet. If this condition is met, the patch sets the frto flag to 0, indicating that the loss was real and not a result of F-RTO probing.

The patch also includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a bug and improve the behavior of the F-RTO algorithm. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented unnecessary calls to prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions in the DRM atomic helper code. The revert allows the driver to decide when these functions are noops, instead of handling all the special cases in the core.

The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require a call to prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical. By letting the driver decide, it allows for better handling of such cases.

The patch has been signed-off by Maarten Lankhorst and Acked-by Laurent Pinchart, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them. It also includes a link to the patch message for further reference.

Based on this information, it seems reasonable to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the "radeon_drv.c" file. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

The comment suggests that there is a need to revisit how to properly support kexec within the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager). This indicates that the current implementation is problematic and needs further improvement.

By reverting the commit, the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function is removed, which eliminates the race condition. This is a reasonable solution until a proper fix is implemented.

Therefore, considering the potential issues caused by the race condition and the need for further improvement, accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases would be appropriate.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the estimation of SYNACK RTT (Round Trip Time) in Fast Open for TCP connections.

2. The patch modifies the function `tcp_synack_rtt_meas()` to take into account the possibility that `tp->lsndtime` may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

3. The patch introduces the variable `synack_stamp` to store the SYNACK timestamp, which is either obtained from the request socket (`tcp_rsk(req)->snt_synack`) or from `tp->lsndtime` if no request socket is present.

4. The patch then uses `synack_stamp` to calculate the SYNACK RTT (`seq_rtt`) and updates it using `tcp_ack_update_rtt()` if `tp->total_retrans` is zero.

5. Additionally, the patch checks if `tp->srtt` is zero, indicating that the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the data packets sent in SYN_RECV. In this case, the patch updates the smooth RTT using `tcp_ack_update_rtt()`.

6. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Yuchung Cheng, Neal Cardwell, Eric Dumazet, and David S. Miller.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `gpio-mpc8xxx.c` file, which is specific to the MPC8xxx family of processors. It adds a new function `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` that handles the direction of GPIO pins for the MPC5121 processor. This function checks if the requested GPIO pin is within the range of 28 to 31, which are input-only pins on the MPC5121. If the pin is within this range, the function returns an error. Otherwise, it calls the existing `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function to handle the direction change.

Additionally, the patch modifies the initialization of the `gpio_chip` structure by conditionally assigning the `direction_output` and `get` function pointers based on the device compatibility. If the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc5121-gpio", the `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` function is assigned to `direction_output`, and if the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc8572-gpio", the `mpc8572_gpio_get` function is assigned to `get`. Otherwise, the existing `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` and `mpc8xxx_gpio_get` functions are used.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch introduces necessary changes to handle the specific behavior of the MPC5121 processor and improves the code by reducing the number of lines for the mach-specific quirk setup. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm in the Nouveau DRM driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a specific resource, and it helps avoid the need for additional checks for the mm's existence throughout the codebase.

2. The patch modifies the `nouveau_mm_init` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/core/mm.c`. It introduces a conditional check for the length parameter. If the length is non-zero, it calculates the offset and length values accordingly. Otherwise, it skips the calculation and proceeds with the default values.

3. The patch also removes the `heap_size` variable from the `struct nouveau_mm` in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/include/core/mm.h`. This variable is no longer needed since the length calculation is now conditional.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement that enhances code readability and avoids unnecessary checks. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to small NVMe-oF queue sizes (<32) causing a potential deadlock. This issue is described in the patch description.

2. The patch modifies the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth rather than using a magic define. This change ensures that IB completions are sent waiting for the appropriate queue depth.

3. The patch includes a new function, `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit()`, which calculates the signaling limit based on the queue size. This function is used to determine whether to signal completion or not.

4. The patch replaces the previous signaling condition (`(++queue->sig_count % 32) == 0`) with a call to `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit(queue)`. This change ensures that signaling is done correctly based on the queue depth.

5. The patch does not introduce any new errors or issues.

6. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Sagi Grimberg, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted developer.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the deadlock issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the desired behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change improves code readability and maintainability by using a dedicated function, msecs_to_jiffies(), to convert milliseconds to jiffies. This function ensures that the conversion is done correctly, taking into account the system's timer resolution.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Marek Vasut and Viresh Kumar, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

4. The change does not introduce any new functionality or alter the existing behavior. It only improves the code by using a more explicit and reliable method for scheduling the delayed work.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a bug introduced by commit 7d32cdef5356, which caused a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver. This bug is a regression and needs to be addressed.

2. The patch adds a validation check for the `musb` pointer before calling `usb_phy_set_suspend()`. This check ensures that the pointer is not NULL before accessing its members, preventing the NULL pointer dereference.

3. The patch also includes the necessary cleanup in the `ux500_resume()` function to avoid the same issue during system resume.

4. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the bug, providing a clear indication of the problem being addressed.

5. The patch has been Acked-by Linus Walleij and signed-off by Ulf Hansson and Felipe Balbi, indicating that it has undergone review and received approval from relevant developers.

Considering all these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the NULL pointer dereference issue during system suspend/resume for the ux500 driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not transitioning from idle to active state when HDMI is enabled. This issue can cause HDMI not to work correctly when it's the default display.

2. The patch provides a temporary fix by ensuring that the DSS clock domain is enabled before calling pm_runtime_get_sync() for the HDMI platform device. This fix allows HDMI's PHY to function correctly.

3. The patch includes a comment stating that the added dss_runtime_get() call is a hack and should be removed later. This indicates that the patch is not a final solution but a temporary workaround.

4. The patch is signed-off by two developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases to address the specific issue with HDMI functionality. However, it is important to note that the patch is considered a temporary fix, and a more comprehensive solution may be required in the future to modify the DSS related hwmod's mainclks and handle opt clocks in the DSS driver.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch fixes a compilation error introduced by a previous commit. The error occurs when taking the address of the bit-field 'maxpacket' in the s3c2410_udc_reinit function of the s3c2410_udc.c file. The patch resolves this error by passing the value of 'ep->ep.maxpacket' instead of its address to the usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit function.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Sachin Kamat and Robert Baldyga. It also includes the sign-off of Felipe Balbi, who made the original commit.

Therefore, considering the fix for the compilation error and the sign-offs, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references a specific commit that introduced the issue. This indicates that the patch is intended to resolve a known problem.

3. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple developers, including Tejun Heo, Hannes Reinecke, and Christoph Hellwig. Their review and acknowledgment provide additional confidence in the patch's correctness.

4. The patch modifies the blk_exit_rl() function to take an additional argument, the request_queue structure (q). This change ensures that the memory allocated for struct request_queue remains valid until all blk_exit_rl() calls have finished. This is necessary due to the introduction of .init_rq_fn() and .exit_rq_fn().

5. The patch also modifies the blkg_free() function to pass the request_queue structure (q) to blk_exit_rl(). This ensures that the correct request_queue is used when freeing resources.

6. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by tags from the author and the reviewer, indicating their agreement with the patch.

7. The patch includes a Cc to the stable mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is well-tested, addresses a specific issue, and has received positive reviews. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The interrupt enable code in the cavium-octeon MMC driver is causing interrupts to fire immediately on certain SoCs with CIU3, breaking the driver functionality.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the history of the problem and its resolution.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code change itself modifies the `octeon_mmc_int_enable` function. It adds a condition to only write to the interrupt enable register if the `has_ciu3` flag is not set. This ensures that the register is not touched on SoCs where it causes immediate interrupts.

Overall, the patch seems to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the hang of direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN.
2. It fixes the problem reported by Michael Tokarev and tested by him.
3. The patch includes a reference to a relevant discussion thread on the Linux-ext4 mailing list.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Eric Sandeen, Tao Ma, and Theodore Ts'o.
5. The patch modifies two files: fs/ext4/inode.c and fs/ext4/page-io.c.
6. In fs/ext4/inode.c, the patch ensures that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag is set and the i_aiodio_unwritten counter is increased simultaneously. This prevents the counter from going negative and causing processes to wait indefinitely.
7. In fs/ext4/page-io.c, the patch handles the case where the buffer is uninitialized and sets the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag and increases the i_aiodio_unwritten counter accordingly.
8. The patch includes comments explaining the changes and the rationale behind them.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and has been tested and signed-off by multiple developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to prevent a lockdep warning in the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function of the IB/ipoib driver. The lockdep warning indicates a possible recursive locking scenario, which can lead to a deadlock.

The patch suggests using the down_read_nested function instead of down_read to prevent the warning. The down_read_nested function allows for nested locking, which is necessary in this case since __ipoib_ib_dev_flush calls itself recursively on child devices.

Considering the potential deadlock and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue and improves the stability of the IB/ipoib driver.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference bug that occurs when read_tree_block() fails.
   - The bug is triggered by a call to free_extent_buffer() with a NULL pointer.
   - The dmesg log shows a kernel oops and a call trace indicating the sequence of function calls leading to the bug.

2. Fix: The patch sets tree_root->node to NULL when read_tree_block() fails.
   - This change ensures that the subsequent code does not attempt to free a NULL pointer, avoiding the NULL pointer dereference bug.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Zhao Lei <zhaolei@cn.fujitsu.com> and Chris Mason <clm@fb.com>.
   - The sign-off indicates that the authors have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch effectively addresses the bug and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a bug in the iwlwifi driver related to the handling of interrupts. Currently, when an interrupt occurs, the reason bits are collected into the "trans_pcie->inta" variable while holding a spinlock. However, there is a bug where the variable is reset after releasing the spinlock, potentially causing missed interrupts if the reset happens after other interrupt reasons were already added.

The patch fixes this issue by moving the reset of "trans_pcie->inta" before releasing the spinlock, ensuring that interrupts are not missed.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition in the initialization of nlmsvc_timeout in the lockd daemon.
2. The race condition occurs when nlmclnt_init() starts the lockd daemon and then calls nlm_bind_host() with the expectation that nlmsvc_timeout has already been initialized.
3. Currently, there is no synchronization between lockd() and lockd_up() to guarantee that nlmsvc_timeout is initialized before it is used.
4. The fix moves the initialization of nlmsvc_timeout into lockd_create_svc, ensuring that it is initialized before being used.
5. The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.
6. It also includes appropriate Cc and Signed-off-by tags for proper attribution and tracking.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an inconsistency between how invalid IPv4 and IPv6 packets are handled in the netfilter module. Currently, IPv6 conntrack marks invalid packets as INVALID and allows the user to drop them explicitly with a rule. However, IPv4 conntrack drops such packets itself.

The patch modifies the behavior of IPv4 conntrack to mark invalid packets as INVALID and allows the user to drop them explicitly. This change ensures consistency between IPv4 and IPv6 packet handling.

The patch includes the necessary changes in the `ipv4_get_l4proto` function in the `nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c` file. It modifies the return values for cases where the IPv4 packet is invalid or contains fragments. Instead of dropping the packet (`-NF_DROP`), the patch changes it to accept the packet (`-NF_ACCEPT`).

4. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, indicating their agreement with the proposed solution.
5. The patch is a simple and straightforward fix that does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch effectively addresses the information leak issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to interrupt storm on resume after system suspension to S3. It explains that certain GPIO pins may be re-initialized or have their interrupt mask re-programmed by the BIOS, leading to an interrupt storm.

2. The issue was fixed by upgrading the BIOS, but since not everyone upgrades their BIOS, the patch aims to fix it in the driver as well.

3. The patch moves the suspend and resume hooks to be called at _noirq time instead. This allows the mask to be restored to a known state before the interrupt storm occurs, as device interrupts are still disabled at that time.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and credits the person who reported the issue.

5. The patch is also marked for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to caching ACLs returned from the server.
2. The issue is described as a potential buffer overflow when the bitmap size + ACL size is greater than a PAGE_SIZE, but the ACL size itself is smaller than a PAGE_SIZE.
3. The patch modifies the `nfs4_write_cached_acl` function to use `_copy_from_pages` instead of `memcpy` to avoid reading past the buffer page boundary.
4. The patch also updates the `__nfs4_get_acl_uncached` function to correctly pass the `pages` argument to `nfs4_write_cached_acl`.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs and credits the individuals who reported and contributed to the fix.

Overall, the patch appears to address a potential issue and provides a solution that avoids buffer overflows. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to fix a rounding error in the calculation of the max_policy_pct value in the intel_pstate driver. The current calculation rounds down the value, which results in the CPU frequency not reaching the expected maximum frequency.

The patch proposes to use the DIV_ROUND_UP macro to round up the value instead, ensuring that the CPU frequency reaches the correct maximum frequency.

Considering that this patch addresses a specific issue and provides a straightforward fix, it appears to be a valid and necessary improvement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the openvswitch module related to retrieving TCP flags. Currently, the code checks if the IP header indicates the presence of a TCP header but does not verify if the packet is long enough to contain the header. This can lead to reading off the end of the packet, resulting in the potential reading of bad data.

The patch adds a length check to ensure that the packet is long enough to contain the TCP header before attempting to retrieve the TCP flags. It uses the `skb_transport_offset` function to calculate the offset of the TCP header and checks if the packet length is greater than or equal to the sum of the offset and the size of the `struct tcphdr`.

This additional check helps prevent reading off the end of the packet and ensures that only valid data is accessed. Although it is mentioned that reading bad data is more likely than a crash, it is still important to avoid such scenarios.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose of preventing potential issues and improving the code's robustness, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a warning related to array bounds in the eicon driver of the ISDN subsystem. The code change modifies the PUT_WORD() macro to directly assign the values to the array elements, avoiding the warning.

My decision is (A) ACK - the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to handling -1 (0xffff) uid or gid values in RPC_AUTH_UNIX credentials. The patch fixes a problem where mountd attempts to write a response but receives -EINVAL. 

The patch has been reported and tested by Sven Geggus, and it has also been signed-off by J. Bruce Fields. Additionally, it has been marked for stable release consideration.

Considering the information provided, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to address a bug related to divides by zero errors in the __tcp_select_window() function. The bug occurs when inet_csk_route_child_sock() returns a NULL pointer, leading to freeing the new socket while the keepalive timer is still armed in tcp_create_openreq_child().

The patch proposes a fix by calling tcp_clear_xmit_timers() before unlocking the socket and freeing it. This ensures that the xmit timers are cleared before the socket is released.

Considering the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the analysis of the patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here are the reasons for my recommendation:

1. The patch addresses an error handling issue in the udc_pci_probe() function. It adds proper resource deallocations in udc_pci_probe() itself, which improves the error handling process.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where calling regulator_get with a NULL dev argument causes an error when printing /sys/kernel/debug/regulator_summary. The patch explicitly handles "deviceless" consumers in the debugfs code, ensuring that the error is avoided.

The patch includes the necessary changes to the regulator_summary_show_subtree function, where it checks if the consumer's dev is not NULL before continuing with the iteration. If the dev is NULL, it prints "deviceless" instead of the dev_name.

The patch also includes the appropriate Signed-off-by tags from the authors and the relevant Cc tags.

Overall, the patch seems to fix a specific issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch introduces a new interface called add_device_randomness() for adding data to the random pool that is likely to differ between devices or even per boot.
   - This is useful for devices that might otherwise be identical and have very little entropy available to them, especially in the embedded world.

2. Changes made by the patch:
   - The patch adds the add_device_randomness() function to the random.c file.
   - The function takes a buffer and its size as input and adds the data to the input and nonblocking pools to help initialize them to unique values.
   - The function does not add any actual entropy to the pool but initializes it with different values for devices that might otherwise be identical.

3. Impact of the patch:
   - The patch does not introduce any new entropy to the random pool.
   - It only helps initialize the pool with different values for devices that lack entropy.
   - The patch does not affect the existing interfaces for gathering environmental noise.

4. Sign-offs and Cc:
   - The patch has been signed-off by Linus Torvalds and Theodore Ts'o.
   - It is also Cc'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org and drivers/char/random.c mailing lists.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable addition to the Linux kernel.

The patch suggests reverting a deprecation warning for the SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP module. The reasons for reverting the warning are outlined as follows:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and is considered set in stone, meaning it will not change in the future. Therefore, there is no benefit in warning about its deprecation.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. Many SCTP appliances are slow to migrate to newer kernels, so reverting the warning would be helpful for them.

3) Some users may not have the ability to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users would encounter the warning and be stuck with older kernels.

Considering these reasons, it seems reasonable to accept the patch and revert the deprecation warning. The patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and signed-off by Daniel Borkmann. It also has the Acked-by tag from Jamal Hadi Salim and the Signed-off-by tag from David S. Miller.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve the dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() function in the dwc3 gadget driver. It modifies the loop that iterates over the endpoints to only iterate over IN endpoints that are actually present, based on the num_in_eps parameter. This change prevents dereferencing a potential NULL dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

The patch replaces the existing loop condition "num < DWC3_ENDPOINTS_NUM" with "num < dwc->num_in_eps" to limit the iteration to the number of IN endpoints. It also updates the calculation of the endpoint index to use the new loop variable "num" instead of "dep->number >> 1".

The change in the loop condition and endpoint index calculation ensures that only valid IN endpoints are processed, improving the efficiency of the function.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the dwc3 gadget driver and does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the powerpc specific nx-842 compression driver. Currently, the driver does not handle translating a vmalloc address to a physical address correctly. The driver uses __pa() for all addresses, which does not handle vmalloc addresses properly and causes failures when a proper physical address is not passed to the hypervisor.

The patch introduces a new routine, nx842_get_pa(), which converts an address to a physical address. It checks if the address is a vmalloc address and handles it properly by using page_to_phys() and offset_in_page() functions. For non-vmalloc addresses, it falls back to using __pa().

The patch also updates the usage of __pa() in various parts of the code to use nx842_get_pa() instead. This ensures that vmalloc addresses are handled correctly when building scatterlists and compressing/decompressing data.

Overall, the patch fixes the issue with handling vmalloc addresses in the nx-842 compression driver and improves the reliability of the driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses a reported issue where the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) L2 header check fails on IB/ipoib (InfiniBand over IP) traffic. The patch proposes a more generic approach to the L2 header check, taking into account the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes.

The patch introduces a new variable, maclen, which holds the value of skb->dev->hard_header_len. This variable is then used to determine the appropriate comparison method for the L2 header check.

If maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length), the existing compare_ether_header function is used to compare the L2 headers of the received packet and the aggregated packet. Otherwise, if maclen is not equal to ETH_HLEN, a memcmp function is used to compare the L2 headers.

The patch also updates the NAPI_GRO_CB(p)->same_flow value based on the comparison result.

Overall, this patch improves the generic L2 header check in the GRO code and addresses the reported issue. It has been reviewed and tested by multiple contributors, including the original reporter. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential lost wakeup scenario in the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl function of the staging driver quatech_usb2. Currently, when the usermode app performs the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl, the code sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and waits for the qt2_process_modem_status function to wake it up on URB completion.

However, there is a race condition between the qt2_ioctl loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status. This race condition can result in a lost wakeup scenario, where the usermode app's task continues to sleep despite a change in the modem status.

The patch introduces a barrier to ensure memory ordering, and it also sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop. This ensures that the task can be woken up correctly when the modem status changes.

Additionally, the patch handles the case where there is no change in the modem status by setting the task state to TASK_RUNNING and returning an error (-EIO). It also handles the cases where specific modem status bits (such as TIOCM_RNG and TIOCM_CTS) change and returns success (0) in those cases.

Overall, the patch addresses the race condition and ensures correct behavior in handling modem status changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch improves PM runtime and PHY handling for the 2430 glue layer in the USB MUSB driver.

However, please note that a thorough analysis of the patch's impact on the overall system and potential side effects should be conducted before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch adds a new function called get_random_long() which complements the existing get_random_int() function. This new function is needed to generate a random offset for the mmap_base address, especially on 64-bit x86 systems where more than 32 bits of randomness may be required.

2. The shifting constant in mmap_rnd() is fixed to be an unsigned long, ensuring that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is important for x86 systems as values over 31 bits would otherwise disable mmap_base randomization.

3. Calls to get_random_int() are replaced with get_random_long() where appropriate, ensuring consistent and correct usage of the new function.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Kees Cook and signed-off by multiple maintainers and contributors, indicating that it has undergone proper review and testing.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue and introduces necessary changes without introducing any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue caused by the introduction of a new behavior in the xfs_sb_from_disk() function, which also calls xfs_sb_quota_from_disk by default. However, the existing separate calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk were not updated, leading to issues when calling it twice on a V4 superblock.

2. The patch fixes the issue by making it safe to call xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice and removes the extra calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk.

3. The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the behavior change in sb_from_disk occurred after V5 became the default. Therefore, the issue only exists on V4 superblocks.

4. The patch has been reported by Eryu Guan and reviewed by Carlos Maiolino, providing additional validation.

Based on the analysis, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

The check currently tests `desc->irq_data != NULL` or `irq_data->domain != NULL`, which prevents adding an `irq_domain` to an `irq` descriptor when `irq_data` exists. However, this check is incorrect as it should be `desc->irq_data == NULL` instead.

2. The patch splits the check for `irq_data == NULL` into a separate warning, which improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and relevant Cc tags for proper attribution and notification.

4. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) for reference.

5. The patch is signed-off by Thomas Gleixner, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted developer.

2. The patch provides a temporary solution: The patch registers the Exynos DRM device object only for Exynos SoC, which resolves the infinite loop issue temporarily. The comment in the code indicates that a more generic solution will be implemented later.

3. The patch checks compatibility: The patch includes checks to ensure that the device object is only registered for compatible Exynos SoC machines. If the machine is not compatible, the function returns -ENODEV, indicating that the device object should not be registered.

4. The patch is signed-off: The patch is signed-off by the author, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, it's important to note that this decision is based solely on the information provided in the patch and further review and testing may be necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses two audio bugs: The first bug is related to incorrect audio input value when changing audio encoding, and the second bug is related to incorrect handling of the default_audio_input module option.

2. The first bug has always been present, but starting from kernel version 3.10, it always occurs when the driver is loaded. Previously, it would only occur if the user changed the audio encoding after the driver was loaded.

3. The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and affects the default_audio_input module option handling, preventing the audio encoding from switching to AC3 when default_audio_input is set to 2 (SPDIF input).

4. The patch also fixes a small typo in a comment (bufffer -> buffer).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock from the imx-tve driver. The enable_lock was claimed to serialize tve_enable/disable calls, but it is unnecessary because DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions.

2. Holding a spinlock while calling clk_prepare_enable() is incorrect and can cause a might_sleep() warning if debugging is enabled. Therefore, removing the enable_lock is the correct approach.

3. The patch removes the enable_lock initialization in the imx_tve_probe() function since the lock is no longer used.

Overall, the patch removes unnecessary code and fixes a potential issue with the enable_lock spinlock. It improves the code by relying on the existing DRM mutex for serialization and avoids potential warnings. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any other factors that may affect the decision to accept the patch.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of stack-allocated buffers for DMA in the stk-webcam driver.

2. The patch allocates a buffer using kmalloc() instead of using a stack-allocated buffer. This ensures that the buffer is allocated from the DMA-enabled area, which is necessary for USB control messages.

3. The patch correctly checks if the buffer allocation fails and returns an error (-ENOMEM) in such cases.

4. The patch uses the allocated buffer (buf) in the usb_control_msg() function instead of the stack-allocated buffer. This ensures that the DMA operation is performed correctly.

5. The patch also correctly handles the return value of usb_control_msg() and copies the value from the buffer (buf) to the provided value pointer using memcpy().

6. The patch frees the allocated buffer using kfree() before returning from the function.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with DMA in the stk-webcam driver and provides a proper solution by using dynamically allocated buffers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses two issues:
   a. It fixes the lack of checking the return value of `rpc_clone_client()`.
   b. It resolves a memory leak caused by not shutting down the cloned `rpc_clnt` in the case of `NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC`.

2. By moving the call to `rpc_clone_client()` after `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` has completed its operations, the code is simplified.

3. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was identified by Andy Adamson.

4. The patch is signed-off by Trond Myklebust, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch has been tested by Mike Galbraith and signed-off by Peter Zijlstra, indicating that it has undergone testing and review.

3. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), providing additional context and discussion around the patch.

4. The changes in the patch modify the select_idle_sibling() function in the kernel/sched_fair.c file. The modifications introduce a new variable, "smt," and add a loop to iterate through the sched_domain structure.

5. The loop checks for various conditions, including whether the domain shares CPU power and whether there are idle CPUs available. It also stops looking for idle siblings when it reaches the domain that spans the current CPU and the previous CPU.

6. The modifications ensure that select_idle_sibling() avoids picking a sibling thread if there is an idle core that shares cache, improving SMT balancing.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be well-tested, addresses a common issue, and introduces improvements to the SMT balancing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets the queue limits for the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This helps ensure that the command size on the admin queue is not arbitrarily low and that other limitations are properly applied.

2. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function sets various queue limits based on the values stored in the `ctrl` structure. These limits include maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush requirements, and virtual boundary. These limits are necessary for proper functioning of the admin queue.

3. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function is called in two places: `nvme_init_identify` and `nvme_alloc_ns`. This ensures that the queue limits are set correctly during initialization and when allocating a new namespace.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs, reported-by, tested-by, and reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with the admin queue and improves the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to remove the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks in the specified files. The reason for this removal is that when the "gpmc_fck" clock is obtained in gpmc.c, it results in misconfigured timings and devices being lost due to divisions by zero.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. By removing the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks, the patch ensures that gpmc.c can handle failures gracefully, preventing misconfigurations and device loss.

However, please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch defines a new state called "CONNECTED" for a ceph connection. This state is set when the connection sequence completes successfully and cleared when the connection gets closed. This explicit state definition improves clarity and maintainability.

2. The patch also updates the code to be more careful when examining the old state during a socket disconnect event. It clears the "CONNECTED" state when a socket disconnect event occurs.

3. The patch includes changes in three different sections of the code: `net/ceph/messenger.c`, `void ceph_con_close(struct ceph_connection *con)`, and `static void con_work(struct work_struct *work)`. These changes ensure that the "CONNECTED" state is properly set and cleared in the relevant code sections.

4. The patch includes a Signed-off-by line from the author and a Reviewed-by line from a reviewer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch introduces a necessary and well-implemented change to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the usb gadget serial driver. The patch adds a check for the 'port->port_usb' pointer before accessing it to avoid the crash.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It appears to fix a potential crash and improves the stability of the usb gadget serial driver.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes an issue reported by Coverity, where the allocation size passed to `devres_alloc()` is incorrect. The patch corrects the allocation size to `sizeof(*rcwdd)` instead of `sizeof(*wdd)`. 

The patch also includes the necessary Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit. It has been reviewed and Acked by relevant individuals, which adds credibility to its correctness.

Therefore, considering the fix and the appropriate review process, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of the in_irq() function in the intel_check_page_flip() function in the intel_display.c file of the i915 driver.

2. The in_irq() function only tests for hard-IRQ context, which can lead to warnings when the system is run with the 'threadirqs' option selected. This is because the intel_check_page_flip() function can be called in soft-IRQ context, causing the warnings.

3. The proposed solution is to replace in_irq() with in_interrupt(). The in_interrupt() function allows for either type of interrupt context and still detects and complains about misuse of the page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

4. The patch includes a reference to a Bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321) that provides additional context and information about the issue.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

6. The patch is also marked for inclusion in the stable branch (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), suggesting that it has been deemed suitable for stable releases.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue, provides a reasonable solution, and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the efficiency of power table parsing in the DRM Radeon driver.
2. The patch replaces the manual lookup of the max_vddc value with a stored value, reducing the need for repeated lookups.
3. The change is made in two functions: `ni_parse_pplib_clock_info` in `ni_dpm.c` and `rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info` in `rv770_dpm.c`.
4. In both functions, if the vddc value is 0xff01, the patch checks if `pi->max_vddc` is available and assigns it to `pl->vddc`.
5. This change avoids the need to call `radeon_atom_get_max_vddc` function, resulting in improved performance.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable optimization that reduces redundant lookups and improves efficiency. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable. It works for some people with specific USB host controllers but causes the device to not wake up for important events like HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request.

The patch mentions that there were initial patches to the xHCI USB controller that fixed the issue for some people but not for all, indicating that the problem may lie in the USB subsystem, USB host controllers, or hardware issues.

Given the unreliability and potential impact on important events, reverting the patch is considered the safe action. Therefore, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final decision-making.

2. It considers the number of Tx queues while calculating the length of Tx statistics.
3. It calculates the statistics length properly for both 82xx and 83xx adapters.
4. The patch includes changes to the qlcnic_82xx_statistics and qlcnic_83xx_statistics functions to account for the number of Tx rings in the adapter.
5. The qlcnic_dev_statistics_len function is modified to handle both 82xx and 83xx adapters correctly and returns the correct statistics length.
6. The patch also includes changes to the qlcnic_get_sset_count function to use the qlcnic_dev_statistics_len function for determining the length of statistics.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue in the qlcnic driver and improves the accuracy of statistics length calculation. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the original implementation had a logic error in the clock disable logic for the sdhi and mmcif drivers. The patch corrects this error by changing the bitwise AND operator to a bitwise OR operator in the clock disable lines.

In the patch, the following lines are modified:

```
__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) & (1 << 12), SMSTPCR3);
```
is changed to:
```
__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) | (1 << 12), SMSTPCR3);
```

And similarly, the following lines are modified:

```
__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) & (1 << 13), SMSTPCR3);
```
is changed to:
```
__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) | (1 << 13), SMSTPCR3);
```

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is correcting a logic error in the original implementation. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to fix an issue with the rtnl_calcit() function in the RT netlink code. The current implementation does not account for the size of the netlink message header when calculating the minimal dump size. The patch proposes to fix this by using the nlmsg_total_size() function to include the header size in the calculation.

Considering the nature of the patch and the problem it addresses, it appears to be a valid fix for an existing issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function.

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to USB2 root hub ports not clearing the PLC bit when the link state changes. This bug fix ensures consistent behavior across USB3 and USB2 root hub ports.

2. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Andiry Xu, Sarah Sharp, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and testing by experienced individuals.

However, please note that my analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. It is always recommended to conduct thorough testing and review before applying any patch to a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a possible NULL pointer dereference issue introduced in commit 219580e. The issue occurs when the function wait_event_interruptible() is called before functionfs_bind() is invoked, resulting in epfile->ffs->gadget being NULL. Later, the 'gadget' variable is used as a parameter in usb_ep_align_maybe(), which dereferences it.

To fix this, the patch moves the assignment of the 'gadget' variable after the waiting has completed, ensuring that it is not NULL when used in usb_ep_align_maybe().

The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch addresses a bug reported in the bug tracker (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83184).
3. The change is signed-off by the author, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved.
4. The patch includes the necessary Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list and the relevant file (drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_atombios.c).
5. The added code checks the device and subsystem vendor/device IDs to identify the specific board.
6. If the board matches the specified IDs and the connector type is VGA, the function returns false, indicating that the quirk should not be applied.
7. The return value of false prevents the quirk from being applied, which is the desired behavior for this specific board.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific board, addressing a known bug. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix for the renaming of the function `dev_hw_addr_random()` to `eth_hw_addr_random()` in the `lpc_eth.c` driver. This patch ensures that the correct function is called to generate a random hardware address for the network device.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue in the driver, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, to make a more accurate decision, it would be helpful to have additional information such as the context of the patch, any potential side effects, and whether it has been tested thoroughly.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to inject a #GP (General Protection) exception when a guest sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value. This is a necessary check to ensure the guest does not set an unsupported or incorrect value.

2. The patch modifies the `vmx_set_msr` function in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c`. It adds a check using the `kvm_mtrr_valid` function to verify the validity of the MSR_IA32_CR_PAT (PAT CR) value before writing it to the guest's IA32_PAT MSR.

3. The `kvm_mtrr_valid` function is defined in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c`. It performs checks on the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values to ensure they are valid. This function is also exported for use in other parts of the code.

4. The `set_msr_mtrr` function in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c` is modified to use `kvm_mtrr_valid` instead of the previous `mtrr_valid` function. This ensures that the MTRR values are checked for validity before being set.

5. The `kvm_mtrr_valid` function is also declared in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.h` to make it accessible to other files.

Overall, the patch adds necessary checks to ensure that the guest's PAT CR and MTRR values are valid. It improves the stability and security of the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to going to full sleep on PS idle in the ath9k driver.

6. The patch modifies the ath9k main.c file, specifically the ath9k_ps_restore() function.
7. The patch changes the condition for determining the sleep mode based on the PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK flag.
8. The patch ensures that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission is pending.
9. The patch also adjusts the condition for determining the sleep mode based on other PS flags.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and has been reviewed and approved by the author. It also includes the necessary tags for stable release. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to non-link packets in the Bluetooth H5 driver. When a non-link packet is detected, the h5_reset_rx() function is called to free the Rx skb (socket buffer). However, the patch currently does not return after calling h5_reset_rx(), which can lead to a kernel oops when the subsequent h5_rx_payload() function is called and tries to dereference a NULL Rx skb.

To fix this issue, the patch adds a return statement after calling h5_reset_rx(), preventing the dereferencing of a NULL Rx skb. This ensures that the kernel oops is avoided.

Given that the patch addresses a specific bug and provides a clear fix, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and hdelta is just a little larger than half a buffer time. In such cases, the current condition wrongly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that even if hdelta is slightly larger than half a buffer time, it won't be considered as a double acknowledged interrupt.

The patch also mentions that jiffies, which is used for hdelta calculation, is not high resolution and may have inaccuracies. This is a valid concern, and the patch takes it into account.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario and improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata by using the real length of the data instead of the padded length. This bug is a deviation from the specification and needs to be addressed.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it does not introduce any issues.

3. The patch removes the usage of magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by the commit mentioned.

5. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug, improves code quality, and has the necessary approvals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the removal of code that set lpm_capable for USB 3.0 super-speed root hub. The intention of the previous change was to avoid touching the usb core internal field, but it resulted in lpm not being functional at all in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch adds code to check and set lpm_capable when registering a root hub device, ensuring that lpm functionality is restored.

3. The patch can be back-ported to kernels as old as v3.15, which indicates that it is considered stable and suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Alan Stern, which adds credibility to its correctness and suitability.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a functional issue and has been reviewed and deemed suitable for inclusion in -stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted (ACK) in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current implementation counts all interrupts as false ones if there is nothing the driver can do with them. However, there may be cases where a SCI EC interrupt is fired during normal read/write operations, which should not be considered false. The patch aims to fix this problem.

2. The patch includes proper documentation: The commit message clearly explains the issue and the proposed solution. It also includes the signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. The code changes are straightforward: The patch modifies the `advance_transaction()` function in the `ec.c` file. It adds a condition to check if the SCI bit is set in the status variable. If it is set, the interrupt is not considered false, and the IRQ count is not incremented.

4. The change is well-justified: The patch ensures that SCI EC interrupts during normal read/write operations are not incorrectly counted as false interrupts. This improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the ACPI/EC subsystem.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and its description, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the calculate_imbalance() function in the sched/balancing module. The bug occurs when the local average load is greater than or equal to the busiest average load, which can result in an imbalance overflow. This can lead to constant task bouncing between CPUs, especially when there are pinned tasks.

The patch fixes this issue by skipping the assignment and assuming an imbalance of 0 when the local average load is greater than or equal to the sds (scheduling domain span) average load.

The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and the maintainers, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Additionally, a link to the original discussion thread is provided for further reference.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent the mentioned issue.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch aims to extend the initial check for PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to cover all RGMII variants. This is done to allow Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) for any RGMII mode, as it is a property of the RGMII interface and its delays.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.

3. The patch is signed-off by Florian Fainelli and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code changes in the patch modify the phy_init_eee() function in the phy.c file.

5. The patch checks if the duplex mode is full and if the interface is MII, GMII, or any RGMII variant (PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID). It also allows internal PHYs to proceed if they support EEE.

6. The patch retrieves the EEE capabilities and settings for the PHY device.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix that extends EEE support to all RGMII variants. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to pen and touch events on tablets that support both pen and touch input.
2. The patch ensures that pen events are not sent before touch is up or forced out, preventing unfinished touch events from competing with pen events.
3. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating their approval and agreement with the changes.
4. The changes are localized to the "wacom_wac.c" file, specifically in the "wacom_intuos_inout" and "wacom_bpt_pen" functions.
5. The changes do not appear to introduce any new issues or regressions.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific problem and has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to AArch64 UEFI implementations disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices(). This issue can lead to alignment faults when manipulating the FDT with the MMU off.

2. The patch fixes the issue by moving the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that the FDT manipulation occurs in a more appropriate place and avoids alignment faults.

3. The patch also mentions that disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices() is not compliant with the UEFI spec and carries great risk. By addressing this issue, the patch ensures compliance with the UEFI spec and reduces the risk associated with switching from cached to uncached memory accesses.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the memremap's helper function try_ram_remap(). Currently, the function dereferences a struct page pointer derived from a PFN without checking if the PFN is valid. The assumption is that the PFN is covered by a 'System RAM' iomem region and has a struct page associated with it, which is covered by the kernel direct mapping.

However, this assumption may not hold true on all architectures, specifically ARM and arm64, where 'System RAM' may include regions for which pfn_valid() returns false. To ensure correctness, the patch adds a check for pfn_valid() before calling pfn_to_page() in try_ram_remap().

This change aligns with the general practice of only calling __va() and pfn_to_page() on PFNs/physical addresses for which pfn_valid() returns true.

Given that the patch addresses a potential issue and follows the recommended practice, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the MACB/GEM driver in the Linux kernel. It states that the checksum field needs to be initialized to 0 to ensure correct results on transmit in all cases. Specifically, it mentions that on Zynq, UDP packets with a payload size less than or equal to 2 contain incorrect checksums.

The patch introduces a new inline function called `macb_clear_csum` which is responsible for initializing the checksum field in the SKB (socket buffer) structure. It first checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled, and if not, it returns without making any changes. If checksum offloading is enabled, it ensures that the SKB header can be modified and then sets the checksum field to 0.

The `macb_start_xmit` function, which is the main transmit function in the MACB/GEM driver, calls the `macb_clear_csum` function before mapping the SKB for DMA transfer. If `macb_clear_csum` returns an error, indicating that the SKB header couldn't be modified, the SKB is freed and the function returns `NETDEV_TX_OK`.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to checksum calculation in the MACB/GEM driver and provides a solution by initializing the checksum field to 0. It also includes proper error handling in case the SKB header cannot be modified. Therefore, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may not match the panel's preferred mode due to incomplete initialization. It replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if the resolutions don't match.

2. Patch implementation:
   The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the `radeon_connectors.c` file. It introduces a loop to iterate through the probed modes of the connector and checks if any mode has the `DRM_MODE_TYPE_PREFERRED` flag set. If found, it compares the resolution of the preferred mode with the native mode and replaces the native mode if they don't match. Additionally, if the native mode is still not set, it tries to obtain the native mode details from the EDID.

3. Patch rationale:
   The patch addresses a specific corner case where the BIOS native mode may not accurately represent the panel's capabilities. By using the panel's preferred mode, which is likely to be more reliable, it ensures that the correct mode is used. This improves the overall functionality and compatibility of the radeon driver.

true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file.

The purpose of the cond_resched() call was to allow scheduling in non-atomic contexts during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy(). However, it was found that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy() is called in atomic context, making scheduling not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386.

The patch argues that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration, it is still better than using cond_resched() to cover only non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch is reverting a previous commit, specifically commit 773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c. The reason for the revert is mentioned as the lack of dithering reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

The original patch is described as complete nonsense since the backtraces in the referenced bugzilla are about gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

Looking at the code changes, the patch adds code to set the 8to6 dither flag in the gmch_pfit.control field for gen2/3 hardware. It also ensures that pre-965 sets dither correctly for 18bpp panels.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch is addressing a reported issue with dithering on gen2/3 hardware and correcting the dither setting for 18bpp panels. Considering the reported need for this patch and the fact that it reverts a previous commit, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the vgic-v3.c file in the virt/kvm/arm/vgic directory. It addresses an issue related to level interrupts in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

The patch introduces changes to the vgic_v3_fold_lr_state() function. Previously, when reading back from the list registers, two actions were performed for level interrupts: clearing the soft-pending bit if the interrupt is not pending anymore in the list register and resampling the line level and propagating it to the pending state.

However, the patch suggests that these two actions should not be linked, and the line level should always be resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. This is important to avoid injecting spurious interrupts that have already been retired.

The patch modifies the code block responsible for clearing the soft pending state and regenerating the pending state for level interrupts. It adds a condition to check if the interrupt configuration is VGIC_CONFIG_LEVEL. If it is, the patch ensures that the line level is always resampled by updating the irq->pending variable with the logical OR of irq->line_level and irq->soft_pending.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to level interrupts in the KVM subsystem and introduces a necessary change to ensure correct behavior. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses an issue introduced by commit df9e26d093d3, which added support for the RTC source clock on Exynos3250 SoCs. However, this support caused an initialization failure on SoCs that do not require the RTC source clock.

The patch modifies the code to conditionally enable the RTC source clock based on the needs_src_clk flag. If the flag is set, the patch attempts to get the rtc_src clock and enables it. If the clock retrieval fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns with the appropriate error code.

By making this change, the patch ensures that the initialization failure is avoided on non-Exynos3250 SoCs, where the RTC source clock is not needed.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, including Marek Szyprowski and Chanwoo Choi from Samsung, as well as Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds.

Considering that the patch fixes a specific issue related to the doorbell register length on Skylake NTB, and it has been reviewed and Acked-by Allen Hubbe, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the CPU hotplug code for the powernv platform.
2. Currently, offline CPUs are only put into nap mode if the powersave_nap variable is set.
3. However, HV-style KVM on this platform requires secondary CPU threads to be offline and in nap mode.
4. The patch changes the code to always put offline CPUs into nap mode, regardless of powersave_nap.
5. It is mentioned that nap mode works fine on all POWER7 machines, and since the powernv platform only supports POWER7 machines, this change is considered safe.
6. The powersave_nap variable still controls whether or not CPUs go into nap mode when idle, as before.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific requirement for the powernv platform and ensures that secondary CPU threads are in the required nap mode. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the PCI error on lantiq.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of checking the return value of `blk_mq_init_queue` in three different drivers: `null_blk.c`, `nvme-core.c`, and `virtio_blk.c`. The current code checks if the return value is `NULL`, but the patch suggests using `IS_ERR` instead.

The change from `!nullb->q` to `IS_ERR(nullb->q)` in `null_blk.c` ensures that any error condition is properly handled. Similarly, the change from `!dev->admin_q` to `IS_ERR(dev->admin_q)` in `nvme-core.c` and from `!q` to `IS_ERR(q)` in `virtio_blk.c` also improves error handling.

By using `IS_ERR` instead of just checking for `NULL`, the patch ensures that any error condition, not just a `NULL` return value, is properly handled. This is a more robust approach and helps prevent potential issues.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Ming Lei, Jens Axboe, and the maintainers of the respective drivers.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the live deadlock problem until a proper fix can be implemented.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, which assumed that the interrupt trigger was already properly configured. However, this assumption is not safe to make as some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot.

2. The patch fixes the issue: It forces the IRQ to trigger on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. This ensures that the IRQ is properly configured even on boards where interrupt triggers are disabled.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs: It has been signed-off by both Phoebe Buckheister and David S. Miller, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch is concise and focused: It only modifies the necessary code to fix the issue and does not introduce any unrelated changes.

Overall, the patch seems to be well-justified and addresses a specific issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() function in the intel_pstate.c file. The function currently calls intel_pstate_update_perf_limits(), which can cause global P-state limits to change. However, in passive mode, these global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor and are not taken into account by governors when making decisions. This behavior can be confusing and unnecessary.

The patch resolves this issue by removing the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(). This change ensures that the global attributes in sysfs do not change when they have not been written to, aligning with user expectations. Additionally, this change reduces the code size by a few lines.

The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. Since the patch removes the only piece of code updating the per-CPU limits in passive mode, the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account, as expected.

Considering the provided information, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The incorrect access can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect values being used for DRC and EQ modes.

3. The patch correctly modifies the code to use `value.enumerated.item[]` for accessing the enum controls, ensuring the correct values are used.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and the relevant Cc tags.

5. The patch is a fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially cause regressions.

The patch addresses a cleanup issue in the NFS4 module related to the decoding of FATTR4_WORD0_FS_LOCATIONS bits. The commit mentioned in the patch has already fixed the bitmap verification, but the decode_attr_fs_locations function forgets to clean up the FATTR4_WORD0_FS_LOCATIONS bits after decoding success.

The current behavior of decode_getfattr_attrs is to return -EIO when encountering FS_LOCATIONS, which leads to input/output errors when accessing certain directories. The patch resolves this issue by clearing the bit earlier in the code.

The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, including Andreas Gruenbacher, Kinglong Mee, and Trond Myklebust. Trond Myklebust is associated with Primary Data, which suggests expertise in the NFS module.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the variables `record_size`, `console_size`, and `ftrace_size` can be set to 0 to disable the feature. However, calling `rounddown_pow_of_two(0)` is undefined behavior. To fix this, the patch introduces a check using the `is_power_of_2()` function as a condition before calling `rounddown_pow_of_two()`.

The patch ensures that `rounddown_pow_of_two()` is only called when the respective variable is not a power of 2. This prevents the undefined behavior when the variable is 0.

The patch also includes the necessary `Cc` and `Signed-off-by` tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided fix, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a bug that can cause a crash in the Linux kernel when using the UEFI memory attributes table code. The bug is caused by uninitialized spinlocks in the PTE pages allocated by the late_alloc() function.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and does not introduce any significant risks or regressions. However, further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers is necessary to make a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to changing MTU under heavy load when using per-cpu processing. It states that changing MTU can block all port's interrupts and prevent data transmission after the change.

2. The patch introduces two new functions, `mvneta_percpu_enable` and `mvneta_percpu_disable`, which are used to enable and disable percpu interrupts for the time when TXQs and RXQs are reconfigured.

3. In the `mvneta_change_mtu` function, before stopping the device, the patch calls `mvneta_percpu_disable` to disable percpu interrupts. This ensures that interrupts are disabled during the reconfiguration process.

4. After the reconfiguration is complete, the patch calls `mvneta_percpu_enable` to enable percpu interrupts again before starting the device.

5. The patch also includes some unrelated changes related to `mvneta_mdio_remove` and `mvneta_phy_remove`, but they don't affect the functionality addressed by the patch.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix the issue related to changing MTU under heavy load when using per-cpu processing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, to lock access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. This is necessary because other patches in the series introduce runtime modifications to the resource tree that can occur on multiple threads.

2. The patch adds the `DEFINE_SEMAPHORE` macro to define the semaphore.

3. In the `vmbus_allocate_mmio` function, the patch adds a call to `down(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` before iterating over the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. This acquires the semaphore, ensuring exclusive access to the resource tree during the allocation process.

4. The patch also adds a call to `up(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` before returning from the function, releasing the semaphore.

5. The return value of the function is modified to store the result of the allocation attempt. If the allocation is successful (`*new` is not NULL), the function sets `retval` to 0 and jumps to the `exit` label to release the semaphore and return the success value.

6. If the allocation fails, the function returns `-ENXIO` after releasing the semaphore.

Overall, the patch introduces necessary locking to ensure thread-safe access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree during runtime modifications. It follows the established pattern of using a semaphore for synchronization. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch adds an additional argument, "handle_flags," to the function "break_stripe_batch_list" in the md/raid5.c file. This argument allows for more flexibility in setting the STRIPE_HANDLE flag on individual stripes when breaking a stripe_batch_list.

The patch modifies the "break_stripe_batch_list" function to check the value of "handle_flags" and conditionally set the STRIPE_HANDLE flag on stripes based on the given flags. If "handle_flags" is zero, the STRIPE_HANDLE flag is always set on non-head stripes. If "handle_flags" is not zero, the flag is set only if any of the given flags are present.

The patch also updates the "handle_stripe" function to call "break_stripe_batch_list" with the new argument, passing 0 as the value. This ensures that the STRIPE_HANDLE flag is always set when handling a stripe with the STRIPE_BATCH_ERR flag set.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with vga-switcheroo not switching correctly on certain systems, specifically Apple MacBooks. The problem is related to the PCI configuration space not being restored correctly, resulting in MSI not working after the switch.

The patch introduces a new function, "radeon_switcheroo_quirk_long_wakeup," which checks if a longer delay is needed for waking up the device. In this case, the delay is increased to 20 ms. The function is called in the "radeon_switcheroo_set_state" function, where the delay is adjusted before resuming the device and then restored to its original value.

The patch seems to have been tested and verified by the submitter, who experienced the issue and confirmed that the longer delay fixes the problem.

Given that the patch addresses a specific issue and has been tested, it appears to be a valid fix for the problem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a refcounting issue in the of_mdio driver. The issue arises from the fact that the of_phy_connect() and of_phy_attach() functions do not drop the reference to the phy_device when phy_connect_direct() or phy_attach_direct() fails.

The patch fixes this by immediately dropping the local reference to the phy_device after calling phy_connect_direct() or phy_attach_direct(), regardless of their success.

The patch also updates the documentation for the of_phy_find_device() and of_phy_connect() functions to clarify the behavior and the need to drop the refcount using phy_disconnect() or phy_detach().

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses the issue of callers missing the fact that dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count needs to be called under RCU lock. By taking the RCU lock inside dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count(), the patch ensures that the function is called safely.

2. The patch modifies the locking comment to reflect the change in locking behavior. It clarifies that the function now takes rcu_read_lock().

3. The patch handles the case where find_device_opp() returns an error by setting the count variable to the error value and logging an error message. It then releases the RCU lock and returns the count.

4. The patch uses rcu_read_unlock() to release the RCU lock before returning.

Overall, the patch correctly addresses the locking issue and ensures that dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count() is called under the required RCU lock. It also handles error cases appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lock-inversion problem in the xHCI driver. The issue is related to the use of spin_lock() instead of spin_lock_irqsave() in the xhci_irq() function. This can lead to a possible irq lock inversion dependency, as reported by lockdep.

The patch addresses the problem by replacing spin_lock() with spin_lock_irqsave() before acquiring the lock and spin_unlock_irqrestore() after releasing the lock.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It resolves a potential deadlock scenario and improves the reliability of the xHCI driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

Considering the nature of the fix and the potential for crashes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the dmi_scan function in the firmware/dmi_scan.c file. The problem is that the "End of Table" entry, which should have a type of 127, is not being handled properly after the addition of initial SMBIOS v3 support. As a result, the entry is not created in the dmi sysfs.

The patch resolves this issue by moving the end-of-table check after it is handled by the dmi_table function. This ensures that the "End of Table" entry is properly created in the dmi sysfs.

The patch has been reviewed by Ard Biesheuvel and signed-off by Ivan Khoronzhuk and Matt Fleming. It also includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for stable releases.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a small race condition between `copy_process()` and `cgroup_attach_task()`, where `child->se.parent` and `cfs_rq` may point to invalid (old) ones.
2. The race condition occurs when the parent process is forked, and either the parent is moved to another cgroup or the child's `se.parent` and `cfs_rq` are accessed before being updated.
3. In the worst case, this bug can lead to a "use-after-free" scenario and cause a panic.
4. The bug has already been observed and caught in RHEL6.4, indicating its impact and importance.

It provides a generic solution for a specific set of devices, avoiding the need for repetitive edits in the future. However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure compatibility and stability across different Insyde devices.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch relaxes the MTU constraints for vxlan devices without an underlying device. Previously, their MTUs were limited to the conventional ethernet value of 1500, which prevented them from taking advantage of jumbo frames and other larger MTU sizes.

2. The patch allows the MTU of vxlan devices to be set to larger values, up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead. This change provides more flexibility and allows vxlan devices to benefit from larger MTU sizes.

3. The default MTU remains 1500 for compatibility, ensuring that existing configurations are not affected.

4. The patch includes appropriate sign-offs from the authors and an Acked-by from a recognized contributor.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the `vxlan_change_mtu` function to handle the new MTU constraints. The function now checks the maximum MTU based on the underlying device's MTU and adjusts the new MTU if necessary.

6. The patch also introduces a new helper function `__vxlan_change_mtu` to handle the MTU change logic. This function takes into account the strictness of the MTU constraint and adjusts the new MTU accordingly.

Overall, the patch addresses a limitation in the vxlan device's MTU constraints and allows for more flexibility in setting larger MTU sizes. It includes proper sign-offs and does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a registration failure in the s5p-g2d driver, which is causing a boot warning and the failure to register the video device.
2. The commit message explains that the patch is necessary because the parent field of video_device has been converted to v4l2_dev field, and the G2D driver did not set the parent field.
3. The patch adds the missing assignment of v4l2_dev to the vfd structure, which is required for proper registration of the video device.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including the original author and maintainers of the s5p-g2d driver.
5. The patch is also marked for stable release, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to PL2303 devices losing bytes when changing serial settings, even if the settings are the same as before. This issue can be triggered by repeatedly requesting a specific baud rate.

2. The patch compares the encoded settings with the previously used ones before configuring the device, ensuring that unnecessary settings updates are avoided.

3. The patch includes a comment explaining the specific case where the filtering is needed and clarifies that the tty_termios_hw_change check alone is not sufficient.

4. The patch introduces a new member, "line_settings," in the "pl2303_private" structure to store the previously used settings.

5. The patch uses memcmp to compare the current settings with the stored settings and only performs the USB control message if the settings differ.

6. If the USB control message is successful (i == 7), the patch updates the "line_settings" with the current settings.

7. The patch ensures that no additional locking is needed for "line_settings" as it is only used in the "set_termios" function, which is serialized against itself.

Overall, the patch provides a necessary fix for the data corruption issue on termios updates for PL2303 devices. It introduces a targeted solution that avoids unnecessary settings updates and ensures that the previously used settings are compared and stored correctly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the default value of "ret" in the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function. This issue can cause a driver to return -EOPNOTSUPP during the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev.

2. The patch introduces changes to the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function. It initializes the "ret" variable and adds conditional checks to handle the switchdev attribute SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE appropriately.

3. The patch also includes the Reported-by, Signed-off-by, and Acked-by tags, indicating that the issue was reported by Andrew Lunn, the patch was signed off by Vivien Didelot, and it was also acknowledged by Andrew Lunn.

4. The changes made in the patch appear to be focused and necessary to fix the reported issue without introducing any unnecessary modifications.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to be a valid fix for the reported issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch adds a call to `bnxt_qplib_free_mrw()` to deregister the memory region (MR) in the firmware before freeing the fast_reg_page_list.
2. If the deregistration of the MR fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code.
3. The patch then checks if the MR has associated pages and frees them using `bnxt_qplib_free_fast_reg_page_list()`. It also sets the `mr->npages` and `mr->pages` variables to NULL.
4. Finally, if the MR has an associated ib_umem (InfiniBand user memory), it is released using `ib_umem_release()`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where the hardware could try to access host buffers that have been freed before destroying the MR in the firmware. By deregistering the MR in the firmware before freeing the fast_reg_page_list, the patch ensures that the hardware does not access these freed buffers, thus preventing a potential host crash.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to traversing the EEH devices list safely. The current implementation using `list_for_each_entry()` is not safe enough because the EEH devices might be removed from its parent PE while iterating. The patch replaces it with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe list traversal.

2. The patch includes changes in multiple files: `arch/powerpc/include/asm/eeh.h`, `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c`, and `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_pe.c`. These changes are necessary to implement the safe list traversal in the EEH subsystem.

3. The patch introduces a new macro `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` that uses `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to iterate over the EEH devices in a given PE. This macro is used in multiple places within the EEH subsystem to ensure safe iteration.

4. The changes made in `eeh_slot_error_detail()` function in `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c` and `__eeh_pe_state_mark()` function in `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_pe.c` demonstrate the usage of the new macro `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` for safe iteration over the EEH devices.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue and provides a safer way to traverse the EEH devices list. It introduces necessary changes in multiple files and demonstrates the usage of the new macro. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for handling CHECK_CONDITION exceptions within the locally generated XCOPY I/O path. The patch adds the missing xcopy_pt_cmd->sense_buffer[] and updates target_xcopy_read_source() and target_xcopy_setup_pt_cmd() to correctly pass this buffer into transport_init_se_cmd().

Considering that this patch addresses a reported issue and provides a necessary fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a bug that causes corruption on the display and reference counting issues.
2. The bug was introduced in a previous commit, and this patch aims to fix it.
3. The issue was reported by Stéphane Marchesin and confirmed by Chris Wilson.
4. The patch is signed-off by both Chris Wilson and Daniel Vetter, indicating their approval.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to the pch_uart driver. It fixes a memory access violation that occurs when the pch_uart_verify_port() function is called during installation and the DMA channel is not allocated.

The patch modifies the code to allocate the DMA channel if it is not already allocated when pch_uart_verify_port() is called. This ensures that the UART processing acts in DMA mode without causing a memory access violation.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects or regressions.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch description states that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework. Therefore, the explicit call to `plane->destroy` from the `crtc`'s destroy function is no longer necessary.

The patch removes the call to `omap_crtc->plane->funcs->destroy(omap_crtc->plane)`, which fixes the crash caused by double freeing the plane.

Removing this unnecessary call does not introduce any new issues or regressions. It simply removes redundant code that is no longer needed.

The patch is also signed-off by the author, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward fix that improves stability by removing redundant code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a necessary step to set the per-net PipeFS superblock before the MOUNT notification callback is triggered. This ensures that the superblock is properly set when the client's dentries are destroyed.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes to set the per-net PipeFS superblock (sn->pipefs_sb = sb) before the MOUNT notification and unset it (sn->pipefs_sb = NULL) during the UMOUNT notification.

3. The patch also handles error cases by properly calling the RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification and cleaning up resources before returning an error.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario where the client's dentries need to be destroyed along with the per-net PipeFS superblock. It ensures proper handling of the superblock and handles error cases appropriately. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To analyze the patch, let's go through the changes made:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c file.

2. The variable "rep_data" is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch modifies the wacom_get_report() function call by removing the address-of operator (&) before "rep_data" in the last argument.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch fixes a bug and does not introduce any new issues. Additionally, it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, which adds confidence in its correctness.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue where Rx data sometimes drops during non-DMA transfer mode.
2. The patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the read complete condition is true.
3. The patch adds a condition check to verify if the transfer is complete. If the condition is met, it disables interrupts, sets the transfer status, and wakes up the waiting process.
4. If the condition is not met, it logs an error message indicating that the transfer is not completed.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a fix for it. It does not introduce any obvious regressions or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch fixes a bug in the rtl8821ae driver related to an array size mismatch. The bug causes an undefined behavior warning, but it is considered benign as the overwritten values are not used. Linus Torvalds has pulled the patch but suggests fixing it.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting the patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the bug may not have a significant impact, it is still preferable to have a clean and correct codebase.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a fix for preventing screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals from Intel.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the use of ACCESS_ONCE() in the patch is causing a stack overflow issue with certain compilers and CONFIG_KASAN enabled. The error messages indicate that the frame size exceeds the allowed limit of 1024 bytes.

The patch proposes removing the ACCESS_ONCE() macro, which appears to be a micro-optimization. The author has verified that the object code generated without ACCESS_ONCE() is better in terms of stack frame allocation.

Considering that the issue is not urgent and only affects builds with certain compilers and CONFIG_KASAN, it may not be necessary to include this patch in the upcoming 4.11 release. However, it is still recommended to backport the patch to older kernels to address the stack overflow issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) for backporting to older kernels.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up in the MediaTek Ethernet driver. The patch includes a call to `mtk_stop()` to properly stop and free DMA resources and restore the state changed by `mtk_open()` during module removal.

Considering the nature of the patch and the problem it addresses, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is modifying the ext4 file system code in the Linux kernel. The patch suggests using `truncate_pagecache()` instead of `truncate_pagecache_range()` in the collapse range operation. The reason for this change is that `truncate_pagecache()` not only truncates the page cache from the given offset to the end of the file but also removes private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range, which is necessary when shifting the end of the file.

Considering the information provided, it appears that the patch is a valid improvement to the ext4 file system code. It addresses a specific issue and provides a more appropriate function call for the desired behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The driver is calling s3c_hsotg_phy_disable three times instead of once when it is removed. This causes the phy reference counter to go below zero and subsequent module inserts to fail.

2. The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from both s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions.

3. The s3c_hsotg_udc_stop function is called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which already calls s3c_hsotg_pullup, which in turn calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Therefore, there is no need to disable the phy again in s3c_hsotg_udc_stop.

4. The s3c_hsotg_remove function should only be called after udc_stop, so there is no point in disabling the phy once again there.

5. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

6. The patch is also marked for stable releases, indicating that it is a fix for a stable kernel version (3.16).

Based on these points, it seems that the patch correctly addresses the issue and improves the code logic. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM. This is necessary to allow dynamic reconfiguration of trapping on a per-vCPU basis.

2. The patch mimics what KVM/arm64 already does, which is to have a per-vCPU HCR field initialized at setup time.

3. The patch modifies the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_arm.h file by removing the HCR_VIRT_EXCP_MASK definition, which is no longer needed.

4. The patch adds a new field, "hcr," to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch in the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_host.h file. This field will hold the HYP trapping configuration.

5. The patch also adds a new field, "irq_lines," to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch in the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_host.h file. This field will hold the IRQ and FIQ levels.

6. The patch modifies the arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.c file to define the offset of the new "hcr" field in the struct kvm_vcpu.

7. The patch modifies the arch/arm/kvm/guest.c file to initialize the "hcr" field of each vCPU with the HCR_GUEST_MASK value.

8. The patch modifies the arch/arm/kvm/interrupts_head.S file to configure the HCR register based on the operation (vmentry or vmexit). If it's a vmentry, the HCR register is ORed with the IRQ lines value. If it's a vmexit, the HCR register is set to 0.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a necessary and reasonable addition to the Linux kernel for KVM/ARM. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug introduced by commit 2d3cbf8b, which removed the is_task_frozen_enough function and replaced it with a simple frozen call. However, this change broke freezing for a group with stopped tasks, as stopped tasks cannot be frozen. As a result, the group remains in the CGROUP_FREEZING state and never reaches CGROUP_FROZEN.

The patch adds back the is_task_frozen_enough function and uses it at the original locations (update_if_frozen and try_to_freeze_cgroup). This ensures that both frozen tasks and stopped tasks are considered frozen enough when testing for freezing.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Li Zefan, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

Given the nature of the bug and the provided fix, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the freezing issue with groups containing stopped tasks.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch fixes a bug related to the removal of net/ip6t_hashlimit entries in the hashlimit_proc_net_exit() function. The bug causes a warning and a memory leak when destroying the netns.

The patch introduces a new function, htable_remove_proc_entry(), which is called from htable_destroy() to remove both IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories in the netns destroy path. This ensures that all entries are properly removed, preventing the warning and memory leak.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and improves the stability and reliability of the netfilter xt_hashlimit module.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a possible issue in the i2c-sun6-p2wi driver related to the use of snprintf. The current code uses snprintf to copy the platform device name to the adapter name field, which could potentially cause issues if the platform device name contains formatting characters.

The patch replaces the snprintf call with strlcpy, which is a safer alternative for string copying. It ensures that the destination buffer is not overrun and provides a more robust solution.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and the Reported-by tag from the person who reported the issue. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and tested by the relevant parties.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue and provides a safer and more reliable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the DMA debug API related to handling multiple mappings of the same buffer. The problem was that the debug_dma_mapping_error function was not correctly setting the map_err_type field when multiple mappings existed for a buffer.

The patch resolves this issue by updating the search algorithm in debug_dma_mapping_error to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address and is currently in the MAP_ERR_NOT_CHECKED state. This ensures that the map_err_type field is correctly set for all mappings of a buffer.

Additionally, the patch mentions a secondary side effect where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type if multiple buffers use the same address. However, this behavior is considered preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Shuah Khan and Joerg Roedel, and has been signed-off by Alexander Duyck, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds.

Considering the thorough explanation of the issue, the proposed solution, and the positive reviews and testing, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the issue being addressed is related to passing the correct pointer to the `free_irq()` function in the `drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c` file. The patch correctly modifies the code to pass the `ldata` pointer instead of `ldata->rtc` to `free_irq()`.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue where the incorrect pointer was being passed to `free_irq()`, ensuring that the IRQ is properly freed. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and Cc entries.

However, please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the codebase would be advisable before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is a fix for the f75375_write16 function in the f75375s.c file of the hwmon subsystem. The issue being addressed is incorrect bit shifting when extracting the high byte of a 16-bit word.

In the original code, the value is shifted to the left by 8 bits, which is incorrect. The patch corrects this by shifting the value to the right by 8 bits.

The fix is straightforward and addresses a clear bug in the code. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Considering these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an incorrect use of BUG_ON in the iscsit_process_nop_out() function. The current code uses BUG_ON to check if the cmd pointer is NULL, which can lead to a kernel panic. 

2. The proposed change replaces the BUG_ON with a return statement that generates a REJECT + PROTOCOL_ERROR response. This change ensures that the code gracefully handles the case where a flood of zeros in the data stream reaches this block without a valid iscsi_cmd pointer.

3. The patch includes a clear explanation of the issue and the reason for the change, along with the commit history and relevant references.

4. The patch has been reported by Arshad Hussain and has been reviewed by Nicholas Bellinger, the original author of the code.

Considering the above points, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and improve the stability of the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue where the code incorrectly alters the kptr_restrict instead of dmesg_restrict. This is a bug that needs to be addressed.

2. The original patch from Richard Weinberger correctly alters dmesg_restrict, indicating that the misapplication of the patch occurred.

3. The patch adds the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to both dmesg_restrict and kptr_restrict, which are sensitive settings. This ensures that only privileged users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability can modify these settings.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The patch is also marked for inclusion in the stable branch, suggesting that it is considered important for maintaining stability.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to remote attribute invalidation in the XFS file system.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the memory_is_poisoned_16() function in the kasan.c file. The function checks if a 16-byte memory region is poisoned or not. The patch suggests a fix for the last shadow judgment in the function.

The patch explains that the shadow corresponding to a 16-byte memory region may span 2 or 3 bytes. If the memory is aligned on 8 bytes, then the shadow takes only 2 bytes. Therefore, it is unnecessary to call "memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15)" in such cases.

The patch modifies the code to check if the address is aligned on 8 bytes using the IS_ALIGNED() macro. If it is aligned, it returns false, indicating that the memory is not poisoned. Otherwise, it falls back to calling "memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15)".

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Andrey Ryabinin, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the reviewer.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and has received positive feedback from a reviewer. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch addresses a specific issue where the driver does not generate an alarm interrupt even though a time for an alarm is set. This is a bug that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch introduces a new function called `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable` which is responsible for enabling or disabling the alarm clock. This function is used to maintain the enabled state of `rtc_clk` until the alarm interrupt occurs.

3. The patch also makes `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_lock` local to `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable` function, which improves code encapsulation and reduces potential conflicts with other parts of the codebase.

4. The patch modifies the `s3c_rtc_alarmirq` function to call `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable(false)` before returning from the interrupt handler. This ensures that the alarm clock is disabled after handling the alarm interrupt.

5. The patch modifies the `s3c_rtc_setaie` function to call `s3c_rtc_alarm_clk_enable(enabled)` before returning. This ensures that the alarm clock is enabled or disabled based on the value of `enabled`.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of missing alarm interrupts and introduces a new function to handle the enabling and disabling of the alarm clock. It also improves code encapsulation. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the ia64/PCI subsystem. The patch aims to ensure that every PCI-PCI bridge window fits inside an upstream bridge window.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch removes a warning printk related to unaligned AIO (Asynchronous Input/Output) in the ext4 file system. The patch author explains that the warning message generates unnecessary support calls and may sound more severe than the actual situation. They suggest that users can investigate poor I/O patterns using tools like blktrace instead.

Removing the warning message does not introduce any functional changes to the ext4 file system. It only removes the warning message that is printed once per day when unaligned AIO is detected.

Considering the author's explanation and the fact that the warning message does not provide much context or proposed action, it seems reasonable to remove it. This change does not affect the functionality or behavior of the ext4 file system and can potentially reduce unnecessary support calls.

2. The patch correctly identifies that AUDIT_USER_AVC messages should be sent to userspace using printk(), as mentioned in the commit message of 4a4cd633. This aligns with the intended behavior and ensures that these messages are not discarded.

3. The patch modifies the audit_log_common_recv_msg() function to special case AUDIT_USER_AVC messages when audit_enabled is 0. This ensures that audit_buffer allocation is not skipped for these messages, allowing them to be properly handled.

4. The patch includes appropriate Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a bug and aligns with the intended behavior of handling AUDIT_USER_AVC messages. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to prevent KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) false positives in kmemleak. Kmemleak is responsible for detecting memory leaks in the kernel. However, when kmemleak dumps the contents of leaked objects, it reads the whole objects regardless of the user-requested size. This behavior upsets KASAN, which performs checks on memory access.

To address this issue, the patch disables KASAN checks around the object dump by calling the "kasan_disable_current()" function before the dump and "kasan_enable_current()" function after the dump. This ensures that KASAN does not flag any false positives caused by kmemleak's object dump.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Catalin Marinas and signed-off by Dmitry Vyukov, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds.

Considering the nature of the patch and the positive reviews, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a resource leak issue in the qcom/emac driver. The patch addresses two specific issues:

1. In the `emac_phy_config` function, the patch adds a call to `of_node_put` to drop the reference taken by `of_parse_phandle` on the `phy_np` node. This ensures that the reference count is properly managed and avoids a resource leak.

2. In the `emac_probe` and `emac_remove` functions, the patch adds a check for the presence of an ACPI companion device. If there is no ACPI companion device, the patch calls `put_device` to drop the reference taken by `adpt->phydev->mdio.dev`. This ensures that the reference count is properly managed and avoids a resource leak.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a resource leak issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `snd_complete_urb()` in the `sound/usb/endpoint.c` file. It introduces a check for the `EP_FLAG_RUNNING` flag before executing the completion logic for the `urb`. If the flag is not set, the patch skips the pending `urb` and goes to the `exit_clear` label.

The purpose of this change is to optimize the code by avoiding unnecessary processing when the stream is stopped. By checking the `EP_FLAG_RUNNING` flag, the patch allows the completion logic to return early, saving CPU cycles.

The patch also includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` lines, indicating the authors who have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, this patch seems to be a valid optimization that improves the efficiency of the code without introducing any apparent issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch changes the data type of the variable "t" from "unsigned long" to "long" to correctly handle the potential negative return value.

4. This change ensures that the condition "if (t > 0)" correctly evaluates to true only when "t" is positive.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and an Acked-by tag from another developer, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved.

6. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases from version 3.0 onwards, indicating that it is considered a stable fix.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a bug and has been reviewed and approved by other developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch modifies the vfio_group_get_device_fd() function in the vfio.c file.
2. The patch adds a call to vfio_device_get() before fd_install() is called. This ensures that a reference to the vfio_device is grabbed before exposing it via fd_install().
3. The comment in the patch mentions that it is not critical anymore since another thread closing the file will block on ->device_lock before dropping the final reference. However, it is considered cleaner to grab the reference before exposing it.
4. The patch has been Acked-by Alex Williamson and Signed-off-by Al Viro, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a clean and necessary improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is initializing the `rmatch` array in the `of_get_max1586_platform_data` function of the `max1586.c` file. The array is being initialized to zero using the `{ }` syntax.

Considering that the `rmatch` array is a local variable and not a static one, it is important to ensure that all its members are properly initialized. By initializing the array at declaration time, the patch ensures that the structure members have sane defaults instead of having indeterminate values.

Given this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the calculation of image width in the v4l2-dv-timings module. It ensures that the image width is rounded off to the nearest multiple of 8, as required by the GTF (Generalized Timing Formula) standard.

The change is made in the v4l2_detect_gtf function, where the image width calculation is modified. The line "image_width = (image_width + GTF_CELL_GRAN/2) & ~(GTF_CELL_GRAN - 1);" performs the rounding off to the nearest multiple of 8.

This fix is important because a source sending a GTF format has no means of signaling the image width, and the assumed aspect ratio may result in an odd image width. By rounding off the image width to the nearest multiple of 8, the patch ensures compliance with the GTF standard.

The patch also includes proper attribution to the authors and reviewers, which is a good practice.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

This annotation helps ensure that the function and its associated data are placed in the correct sections of memory.

Given that the patch addresses section mismatches and adds the necessary annotations, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the GICD_ICFGR register accesses in the KVM code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. The offset for accessing the internal representation of the ICFGR registers is different from the offset for MMIO-based access. The patch adjusts the internal array offset by one bit to fix this inconsistency.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. The offset is shifted right by one bit before accessing the internal array.
2. The condition for checking the offset is changed from `offset & 2` to `offset & 4`.
3. The condition for checking the offset in the write operation is changed from `offset < 4` to `offset < 8`.
4. The value is compressed using `vgic_cfg_compress` before writing it to the register.

The patch also includes proper attribution to the authors and a reported-by tag.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue where the command timer in the xhci_mem_cleanup() function may not be initialized and scheduled. This can lead to a soft lockup, as indicated by the stack dump.

The patch introduces a check using timer_pending() to verify if the command timer is scheduled before attempting to delete it with del_timer_sync(). If the timer is not pending, the deletion is skipped.

This change ensures that the command timer is only deleted if it is actually scheduled, preventing potential soft lockups.

The patch also includes relevant information such as the reported-by field, signed-off-by fields, and the Cc field for stable release consideration.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided fix, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes some unused assignments in the GFS2 file system code. Let's analyze it further:

In the file `fs/gfs2/file.c`, the patch removes the assignment of the `sdp` variable, which is not used later in the code. This cleanup does not affect the functionality of the code and can be considered safe.

In the file `fs/gfs2/lops.c`, the patch removes the assignment of the `ld` variable, which is also not used later in the code. This cleanup does not impact the functionality of the code and can be considered safe.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves code cleanliness without introducing any functional changes or risks.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bookkeeping issue related to the skb (socket buffer) of a batched packet in the hv_netvsc driver. Without proper bookkeeping, there is a risk of a panic occurring.

2. The patch adds a new structure member, `struct sk_buff *skb`, to the `multi_send_data` structure. This member is used to store the skb containing the packet.

3. The `move_pkt_msd` function is introduced to move the packet out of the `multi_send_data` structure and clear it. This function assigns the skb and packet pointers to the `msd_skb` and `msd_send` variables, respectively, and sets the `skb` and `pkt` members of `msdp` to NULL.

4. In the `netvsc_send` function, the `move_pkt_msd` function is called to move the packet out of `msdp` when a new send section is allocated. This ensures that the previous skb is properly freed.

5. The patch also updates the `netvsc_send_pkt` function call to pass `NULL` as the `skb` parameter, indicating that no skb is associated with the packet being sent.

Overall, the patch addresses a bookkeeping issue and ensures proper freeing of the skb. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch modifies the `cp_start_xmit` function in the `8139cp.c` file.

3. The issue being addressed is that when sending a TSO frame in multiple buffers, the first descriptor was not being set up in TSO mode.

4. The patch introduces the variable `ctrl` to store the control flags for the descriptor.

5. The `ctrl` variable is initialized with the values of `first_eor`, `first_len`, `FirstFrag`, and `DescOwn`.

6. If the `mss` (Maximum Segment Size) is non-zero, the `LargeSend` flag is set in `ctrl` along with the appropriate `mss` value.

7. If the `skb->ip_summed` field is `CHECKSUM_PARTIAL`, the patch checks the `protocol` field of the IP header to determine whether it is TCP or UDP. Based on the protocol, the `IPCS` and `TCPCS` or `UDPCS` flags are set in `ctrl`.

8. Finally, the `opts1` field of the descriptor is set to the value of `ctrl`.

9. The patch also includes the necessary memory barriers (`wmb()`) to ensure proper ordering of memory accesses.

10. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and introduces the necessary changes to fix it. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the per-device workqueue (`rq_wq`) and replaces it with a single workqueue for all devices (`rbd_wq`). This change makes sense because the work function processes "devices" and not "requests". Using a single workqueue simplifies the code and improves efficiency.

2. The patch initializes the `rbd_wq` workqueue in the `rbd_init` function and destroys it in the `rbd_exit` function. This ensures proper initialization and cleanup of the workqueue.

3. The patch updates the `rbd_request_fn` function to use the `rbd_wq` workqueue instead of the per-device workqueue (`rq_wq`). This change ensures that the work is queued correctly.

4. The patch removes the allocation and destruction of the per-device workqueue (`rq_wq`) in the `rbd_dev_device_setup` and `rbd_dev_device_release` functions. This is no longer needed since the per-device workqueue is replaced by the single workqueue (`rbd_wq`).

Overall, the patch simplifies the code and improves efficiency by using a single workqueue for all devices. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to address a misleading and potentially annoying warning message related to RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) domain detection in the powercap/intel_rapl.c driver. Currently, the warning message is printed for every RAPL domain that fails detection, which can be misleading because many CPUs do not support the complete set of RAPL domains.

The patch modifies the warning message to an informational message (pr_info) and only prints out the RAPL domains that are supported. This change provides more accurate information to users and reduces unnecessary noise in the kernel log.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have tested and approved the changes.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the suspend flow in the iwlwifi driver. Currently, when the suspend flow fails, the hardware is restarted to go back to the D0 image. However, the patch suggests complying with the fw_restart module parameter in this scenario.

By complying with the fw_restart flag, the patch ensures that if something goes wrong when starting the D3 image, the firmware state is not cleared up, allowing for easier debugging of the issue. This is a valuable addition as it helps in identifying and resolving potential errors during the suspend flow.

The patch modifies the __iwl_mvm_suspend function in the d3.c file of the iwlwifi driver. It adds a conditional check to decrement the restart_fw counter and only restart the hardware if the counter is greater than zero. This ensures that the fw_restart flag is respected.

Overall, the patch seems to be well-reasoned and addresses a specific issue in the iwlwifi driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a section mismatch warning in the find_numa_latencies_for_group function. It correctly identifies that the function is only called from the __init function numa_parse_mdesc, and therefore it can be tagged with the __init annotation. 

Additionally, the find_best_numa_node_for_mlgroup function is also only called from within __init, so it can also be marked with the __init annotation. 

The patch includes the necessary changes to add the __init annotation to both functions, resolving the section mismatch warning. 

Given that the patch addresses a warning and correctly applies the __init annotation, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a potential crash in the __netdev_pick_tx() function in the bridge code. The patch addresses an issue related to the sender_cpu and napi_id skb fields being a union, which can cause a bug trigger if the packet was received on a NIC using skb_mark_napi_id().

The patch includes the necessary fix by clearing the sender_cpu field using the skb_sender_cpu_clear() function before forwarding the skb. This fix is consistent with the previous commit c29390c6dfee, which addressed a similar issue in the normal forward path.

Given that the patch fixes a potential crash and is reported, tested, and signed-off by relevant individuals, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the call to `cpsw_ale_stop()` function from the `cpsw_ale_destroy()` function in the `cpsw_ale.c` file. 

The patch is addressing a deadlock issue that occurs when the `ti_cpsw` module is inserted and removed, causing a deadlock due to the delete timer. The deadlock is caused by the timer being created and destroyed in `cpsw_ale_start()` and `cpsw_ale_stop()`, which are called during device open and close.

Removing the call to `cpsw_ale_stop()` from `cpsw_ale_destroy()` suggests that the deadlock issue is being addressed by not stopping the ALE (Address Lookup Engine) during destruction. 

Without further information or analysis, it is difficult to determine the exact implications of this change. However, based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it aims to resolve a deadlock issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the request_region() and release_region() calls for the VMMOUSE_PROTO_PORT, which is a port reserved by the ACPI module during system startup. The port is designed to be shared among multiple VMWare services, including VMMOUSE. By removing the request_region() and release_region() calls, VMMOUSE will no longer try to reserve this port on its own.

The patch also removes the release_region() call in the vmmouse_disconnect() function, as well as the request_region() and release_region() calls in the vmmouse_init() function.

The removal of these region reservation calls indicates that the port reservation for VMMOUSE is unnecessary and can cause conflicts with other drivers trying to reserve the same port. By removing these calls, the patch ensures that the port is available for other drivers to use.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to port reservation for VMMOUSE and improves compatibility with other drivers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to fix a race condition between the connected_handler and teardown flow in the iser-target module.

2. The patch takes the isert_conn pointer from cm_id->qp->qp_context to ensure that the cm_id context is always the network portal. This improves the reliability of the cm_id event check.

3. To avoid a NULL dereference in cma_id->qp->qp_context, the patch destroys the qp after destroying the cm_id, making the dereference safe. This accounts for the possibility of parallel session establishment/teardown sequences and the potential race between connected_handler and connection teardown flow.

4. The patch also protects the decrement of isert_conn->conn_device->active_qps within the error patch during QP creation failure and the normal teardown path in isert_connect_release().

The patch is related to the AMDGPU driver for handling the VCE (Video Codec Engine) power-gating flags properly. The patch adds a check to ensure that the VCE power-gating flags are supported before attempting to start or stop the VCE block.

The patch includes changes in two files: vce_v2_0.c and vce_v3_0.c. In both files, the added check verifies if the AMDGPU_PG_SUPPORT_VCE flag is set in the pg_flags field of the amdgpu_device structure. If the flag is not set, the function returns 0, indicating that the power-gating state should not be changed.

This patch is important for ensuring proper handling of the VCE power-gating state when the feature is supported. It prevents unnecessary attempts to start or stop the VCE block when power-gating is disabled.

The patch has been reviewed by Eric Huang and signed-off by Alex Deucher, both from AMD. Their review and sign-off indicate that the patch has been reviewed and tested by experts in the field.

3. If the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag is set in dext->flags and the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, the patch initializes the iphdr structure pointer (iph) using ip_hdr(skb).

4. The patch sets iph->check to 0 and recalculates the IP checksum using ip_send_check(iph).

5. If the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag is set in dext->flags and skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE, the patch performs additional checks.

6. If the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, the patch initializes the iphdr structure pointer (iph) again and calculates the IP header length (ihl).

7. The patch resets the transport_header field using skb_reset_transport_header() and sets it to the correct offset using skb_set_transport_header(skb, ihl).

8. Finally, the patch calls vnet_fullcsum(skb) to compute the full checksum for the packet.

Overall, the patch ensures that the network_header and transport_header fields are properly initialized and that the checksum calculations are performed correctly for IPv4 packets. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) enabled. The issue occurs when the buffer is within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of a 4G boundary.

The patch introduces a new function `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` to test for TSO DMA buffers that cross into regions within MSS bytes of any 4GB boundaries. If the device is of ASIC revision 5762 and the MSS is non-zero, the function checks if the base address plus the length plus the lower 14 bits of the MSS is less than the base address. If this condition is true, it indicates a TSO buffer overflow.

The `tg3_tx_frag_set` function is modified to call `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` and set the `hwbug` flag if the condition is true.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific data corruption issue on the 5725 family of devices and introduces a necessary check to prevent TSO buffer overflow.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to early controllers incorrectly reporting zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register. The ahci driver currently fabricates PORTS_IMPL based on the number of ports in those cases. However, with the new nvme controllers, there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should be honored.

The patch disables the workaround for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3. This means that for AHCI versions 1.3 and above, the fabricating of port_map from cap.nr_ports will not be performed.

The patch has been signed-off by Tejun Heo and reported-by Andy Lutomirski. It also includes relevant links and Cc's to the appropriate individuals and mailing lists.

Considering the specific issue being addressed and the appropriate changes made in the patch, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug reported in the Linux kernel bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75401). This indicates that there is a known issue that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch is signed-off by two developers, Alex Deucher and Christian König, who are both associated with AMD. Their involvement suggests that the patch has been reviewed and tested by experts in the field.

3. The patch modifies the "radeon_atrm_get_bios" function in the "radeon_bios.c" file. It adds support for handling non-VGA class PCI devices with ATRM (AMD Topology and Resource Manager). This update is necessary for newer PX systems that have non-VGA PCI class dGPUs.

4. The patch introduces a new code block that checks for non-VGA class PCI devices. It uses the "pci_get_class" function to iterate through the devices and checks if the ACPI handle for the device contains the "ATRM" string. If a device with the ATRM handle is found, the "found" flag is set to true, indicating that the ATRM fetch method should be used.

5. If no device with the ATRM handle is found, the patch falls back to the existing behavior of returning false, indicating that the ATRM fetch method is not applicable.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported bug and introduces necessary support for newer PX systems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is addressing a specific issue related to GPU hangs on certain machines when large amounts of text scroll in an xterm. This issue has been reported by Udo Steinberg.

2. The patch is disabling semaphores on SNB (Sandy Bridge) architecture, while leaving them enabled for IVB (Ivy Bridge) architecture. This indicates that the issue is specific to SNB and disabling semaphores resolves the problem.

3. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Keith Packard and Linus Torvalds, who have signed-off on it.

4. The change is limited to the `i915_gem_execbuffer.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/i915` directory, which suggests that it is a targeted fix for the reported issue.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the reported GPU hang issue on SNB machines.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug: The patch fixes a double-free bug that occurs when the next beacon is sent and the ath_buf from the previous run is reused.

2. The bug can lead to a system crash: If getting a new beacon from mac80211 fails, the bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, but the skb (socket buffer) is freed. This can result in a double-free on the next beacon transmission attempt, potentially causing a system crash.

3. The fix is straightforward: The patch adds a line of code to reset bf->bf_mpdu to NULL when the skb is freed. This ensures that the double-free bug does not occur.

4. The patch is signed-off by relevant contributors: The patch is signed-off by Felix Fietkau and John W. Linville, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch is marked for stable release: The patch is marked with "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org," indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a specific bug and has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to data corruption seen during a read/write stress test in the spi-ti-qspi driver. The problem occurs when an invalid command is written to the QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG, which terminates the current transfer and de-asserts the chip select. However, if spi_finalize_current_message() is called before de-asserting the chip select, the next transfer can overlap with the previous one, leading to data corruption.

To fix this issue, the patch moves the writing of the invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG before calling spi_finalize_current_message(). This ensures that the chip select is de-asserted before marking the end of the current message transfer and scheduling the next transfer.

The patch also includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent data corruption during spi-ti-qspi operations.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
