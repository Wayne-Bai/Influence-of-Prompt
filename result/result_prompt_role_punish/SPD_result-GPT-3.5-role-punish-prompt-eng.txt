security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). Here's the reasoning:

1. Patch Description: The patch description mentions fixing a problem related to the megaraid driver's initialization on a specific machine. It addresses an issue where the driver was requesting the wrong IRQ number. This problem does not seem to be directly related to security concerns.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `mega_common.h` file in the `drivers/scsi/megaraid` directory. Specifically, it changes the data type of the `irq` field from `uint8_t` (unsigned char) to `int`. This change ensures that the correct IRQ number is stored and used by the driver. Again, this change does not directly relate to security.

3. Patch Sign-offs: The patch includes sign-offs from multiple developers, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes. The presence of sign-offs does not necessarily indicate a security patch.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a functional issue rather than a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is classified as a non-security patch (NSP).
security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). Here's the analysis:

The patch appears to fix a race condition in the usermodehelper code in the kernel. It addresses an issue where the call_usermodehelper_exec() function creates a kernel thread and passes a subprocess_info structure to it. However, the complete() function is called in the wrong place, leading to potential issues with freeing the subprocess_info structure.

The changes made in the patch ensure that the complete() function is called from within the kernel thread and that the subprocess_info structure is not used afterward in the case of UMH_WAIT_EXEC.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a bug or an issue related to the usermodehelper code, rather than directly addressing a security vulnerability. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-security patch (NSP).

security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a security patch (SRP). Here's the analysis:

1. The commit message mentions a bug related to a buffer overflow in functions `acl_get()` and `check_grant_db()` in `sql_acl.cc`. Buffer overflows are often security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

2. The patch description states that the buffer overflow occurs due to an unguarded string copy operation. This suggests that the patch aims to fix the vulnerability by adding necessary sanity checks before copying the database string to the destination buffer.

3. The code changes in `sql_acl.cc` include the addition of a check for the length of the concatenated strings (`ip`, `user`, and `db`) before performing the `strmov()` operations. If the length exceeds the buffer size (`ACL_KEY_LENGTH`), the function returns 0, indicating a failure.

4. Similarly, in the `check_grant_db()` function, a check is added to ensure that the length of the concatenated strings (`sctx->priv_user` and `db`) does not exceed the buffer size (`NAME_LEN+USERNAME_LENGTH+2`). If the length exceeds the buffer size, the function returns 1, indicating a failure.

These code changes aim to prevent buffer overflows by validating the length of the input strings before performing string copy operations. This is a typical approach to addressing security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the patch is likely a security patch (SRP).

The `r_io_desc_resize` function is added to the `r_io.h` and `desc.c` files. It takes a `RIODesc` structure and a new size as parameters. It checks if the `desc` and its plugin have the `resize` function defined. If they do, it calls the plugin's `resize` function and returns the result. Additionally, if the `desc` has an associated `io` and `p_cache` (cache), it performs a cleanup on the cache. This function allows resizing of the `RIODesc` object.

The `r_io_fd_resize` function is added to the `r_io.h` and `fd.c` files. It takes an `RIO` object, an `fd` (file descriptor), and a new size as parameters. It calls the `r_io_desc_resize` function with the `RIODesc` object associated with the given `fd` and returns the result. This function allows resizing of the file descriptor.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch adds functionality related to resizing `RIODesc` objects and file descriptors.

The patch is fixing a bug related to acquiring tokens in the powerpc/opal module. The issue is that the current code checks the completion map to find the first complete token, but in some cases, a completion can come in while the token is still on lease to the caller processing the completion. This can lead to an EBUSY error when another task tries to acquire a token.

The patch reorganizes the acquisition code to look at the opal_async_token_map for an unleased token. If the token has no lease, it means it has no outstanding completions, so there should never be an EBUSY error unless too many tokens have been leased out. The patch aims to prevent the EBUSY error by ensuring that acquiring tokens is not affected by incomplete completions.

Overall, this patch does not address a security vulnerability but rather fixes a bug related to token acquisition. Therefore, it is classified as a non-security patch (NSP).

Looking at the diff, it appears that the patch modifies the file "phishcheck.c" in the "libclamav" directory. The changes made in the patch involve the function "cli_url_canon".

In the modified function, there are changes made to how the username in a URL is handled. Previously, the code used strchr to find the '@' symbol and ignored the username. However, in the patch, the code has been modified to handle cases where the username is not properly encoded.

The patch introduces a while loop that skips any leading slashes in the URL. Then, it calculates the length of the host name by finding the first occurrence of a colon, question mark, or slash after the skipped slashes. Finally, it uses memchr to search for the '@' symbol within the calculated host name length.

Based on the changes made, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to handling unencoded '@' symbols in the username of a URL. This issue could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as allowing unauthorized access or bypassing authentication mechanisms.

Looking at the patch, it appears to be a code modification in the `ff_mpeg_update_thread_context` function in the `libavcodec/mpegvideo.c` file. The patch adds two assertions to check the equality and inequality of certain context variables.

The first assertion added is `av_assert0(s != s1)`, which checks that the `s` and `s1` contexts are not equal. This assertion ensures that the destination context (`dst`) is not the same as the source context (`src`), which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if they were the same.

The second assertion added is `av_assert0(!s->picture || s->picture != s1->picture)`, which checks that the `s` context's `picture` variable is not equal to the `s1` context's `picture` variable. This assertion ensures that the `picture` variable is not overwritten or modified incorrectly, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is a security patch (SRP) because it adds assertions to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior in the code.

Therefore, the answer is (A) a security patch (SRP).
