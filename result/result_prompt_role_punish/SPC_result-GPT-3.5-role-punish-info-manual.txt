false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the z13 architecture in the s390 facilities. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather adds support for a specific architecture, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to NFS remount attempts. The patch checks for changes in version and minorversion parameters and rejects them during remount attempts. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the patch, it seems that the changes are related to ensuring consistency and preventing potential issues during NFS remount attempts. While it may not directly address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption, it does seem to address a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or instability.

Considering the nature of the patch and the absence of any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis of the specific issue and its impact would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to accessing __iomem directly, which can lead to potential issues such as build errors, oops, or data corruption. This qualifies as a real and critical bug.

2. The patch introduces a temporary buffer to copy the channel type, allowing the code to work on architectures that don't support MMIO. This ensures compatibility and prevents potential issues.

3. The patch includes necessary changes to compare the expectedTypeGuid with the copied channel type (guid) instead of directly accessing __iomem. This ensures correct verification of the type GUID and prevents any potential mismatches.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the critical bug and improving compatibility.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debugging enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The changes made in this patch are adding debug messages using the BT_DBG macro to the functions l2cap_sock_shutdown() and __l2cap_wait_ack(). These debug messages provide information about the number of unacknowledged frames and the error value.

Since this patch does not address any real and critical bug, and it only adds debug messages for code analysis purposes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring change rather than fixing a real and critical bug.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only replaces the usage of `atomic_inc` and `atomic_dec_and_test` with `rvt_get_qp` and `rvt_put_qp` functions respectively, which are standard reference counting functions.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only makes the code more maintainable, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new function called "dpm_for_each_dev" in the power management subsystem. This function allows iterating over devices in the dpm_list and calling a provided callback function for each device.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable DMA for SDHI0 on the ARM shmobile bockw board. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds two lines of code to the sdhi0_info structure in the board-bockw.c file. These lines set the dma_slave_tx and dma_slave_rx fields to HPBDMA_SLAVE_SDHI0_TX and HPBDMA_SLAVE_SDHI0_RX, respectively.

2. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a functional enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would say that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using variables. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization for the Btrfs filesystem. It adjusts the chunk size used for metadata on larger filesystems. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is more of an enhancement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an obsoleted check in the ext4 file system code. The patch removes a condition that checks if a buffer head (bh) is NULL or if the current directory entry (de) exceeds the buffer's data size. The patch also includes some code cleanup.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and it contains trivial fixes (code cleanup), I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple conditional modification in the ath9k_hw_reset() function in the hw.c file of the ath9k driver. The patch checks if the MCI (Memory Controller Interface) is disabled before programming the OBS (Outbound Stream) register.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a preventative measure to avoid programming the OBS register when MCI is enabled. While it may be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria of a critical bug.

Furthermore, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the xgifb_epllcd_crt1 table with two different tables, xgifb_epllcd_crt1_h and xgifb_epllcd_crt1_v. This change is made to make further cleanups easier.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding DT (Device Tree) defines for co-processor reset lines in the ARM STi platform. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a sparse warning in the `tuntap` driver. The change makes the `tun_enable_queue()` function static, which resolves the sparse warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes two unused fields from the autofs_sb_info structure. These fields were left behind from a previous commit that removed unused ioctls.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to DMA on SoCs (System on Chips). The patch modifies the `dma_attach` function in the `brcmsmac` driver to add offsets for PCIe devices only, and not for SoCs.

The patch also includes a partial revert of a previous commit that removed unused bus code from the `brcm80211` staging driver.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be a specific optimization or adjustment for PCIe devices.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change to the ath9k driver in the Linux kernel. The patch uses PCI Express Capability access functions to simplify the driver code.

Since the patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue related to Bluetooth coexistence and ASPM settings, it can be considered a valid fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a small inline wrapper for the `device_tx_status` callback of a DMA device. This change aims to make the code more compact and legible for users of this function.

However, since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: drm/i915/vlv: check port in infoframe_enabled v2
   - The patch title suggests that it is related to the Intel i915 graphics driver for the Valley View (VLV) platform.

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off by Jesse Barnes, Rodrigo Vivi, and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch modifies the vlv_infoframe_enabled() function in the intel_hdmi.c file.
   - It adds a check for the port in the infoframe_enabled() function.
   - It retrieves the port value from the intel_digital_port structure.
   - It compares the retrieved port value with the port value obtained from the VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK.
   - If the port values match, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between val and VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE.
   - Otherwise, it returns false.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. The patch seems to be adding a check for the port in the infoframe_enabled() function, which could potentially be related to ensuring correct functionality or preventing issues.

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I cannot provide a clear recommendation of ACK or NAK for this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is related to the "net" subsystem and specifically the "sch_generic" module.

2. The patch author and acknowledgments are provided, indicating that it has been reviewed by other developers.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the behavior of attaching a default qdisc (queueing discipline) to a network device.

4. In the first code change, the condition `if (dev->tx_queue_len)` is modified to `if (dev->tx_queue_len && !(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE))`. This change introduces a new condition that checks if the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is not set in the `priv_flags` field of the network device structure.

5. In the second code change, a similar condition is added to the existing condition `!netif_is_multiqueue(dev) || dev->tx_queue_len == 0`. Now, it also checks if the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set in the `priv_flags` field.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch introduces a new feature or behavior change rather than fixing a real and critical bug. It does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that switches the driver to use the module_platform_driver macro instead of manually defining the init and exit functions. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant "break" statements after "goto" statements. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing whitespace), I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds error checking for the `dev_alloc_skb()` call in the `amsdu_to_msdu()` function. If the allocation fails, the patch breaks out of the loop, indicating a failure. This is a good practice as it ensures that the driver handles allocation failures properly.

2. The patch also adds error checking for the `skb_clone()` call in the `recvbuf2recvframe()` function. If the cloning fails, the patch returns `_FAIL`, indicating a failure. This is important to prevent potential issues with using a NULL pointer.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue by adding proper error handling for the allocations. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug that could lead to failures or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that makes the function `hp_amp_power_on` static. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the addition of codec controls in the ak4642_probe() function. The patch also adds the same controls to the soc_codec_dev_ak4648 structure. 

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes some code and duplicates the same controls in another structure, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character to the end of dev_err messages. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch modifies the code in the hnae.c, hnae.h, hns_enet.c, and hns_enet.h files. It replaces the usage of `struct device_node` with `struct fwnode_handle` in various functions.

The patch aims to improve the uniformity of using `fwnode_handle` instead of `device_node` in the DT (Device Tree) case. It replaces the usage of `of_node` with `fwnode_handle` in the `__ae_match` and `find_ae` functions. Additionally, it replaces the usage of `ae_node` with `fwnode` in the `hnae_get_handle` function.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it addresses a specific issue related to uniformity and compatibility, it can be considered a valid bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check. The patch removes the check for `dst == NULL` in the `if` condition and only checks for `dst->error`. 

Since `ip6_route_output()` will never return a NULL pointer, the check for `dst == NULL` is redundant and can be safely removed. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch switches over to the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. This is a code improvement and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch removes the calculation of the shift value and the mult value, which were previously hardcoded. Instead, it calls clockevents_config() with the ced and p->rate parameters. This change improves the flexibility of the code but does not fix any real or critical bug.

3. The patch also removes the setting of max_delta_ns and min_delta_ns values and replaces it with a call to clockevents_config(). Again, this change improves the code but does not fix any real or critical bug.

4. The patch modifies the clockevents_register_device() call to clockevents_config_and_register(). This change registers the clock event device with additional parameters but does not fix any real or critical bug.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real or critical bug. It only improves the code and adds flexibility. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the existing event handler functions with the generic data ready poll function. The original event handler functions are removed, and the generic function is used instead. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather replaces existing code with a more generic implementation, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch fixes an uninitialized variable warning in the `ath9k_has_tx_pending()` function in the `ath9k` driver. The warning suggests that the variable `npend` may be used uninitialized in the function.

Since this warning indicates a potential issue that could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect program execution, it is not a trivial fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are considered trivial.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues in the `ath9k` driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new function `calibration_delay_done()` with a dummy implementation. This function is used to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and can be used by architectures to stop accepting delay timer registrations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the i2c-brcmstb.c file in the drivers/i2c/busses directory.

2. The patch introduces a new helper function, i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg, which is used to calculate the 8-bit address from the i2c_msg structure.

3. In the original code, the address is calculated by shifting the msg->addr left by 1 and then checking if the I2C_M_RD flag is set to determine whether to set the LSB to 1.

4. The patch replaces the original address calculation with a call to the i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg helper function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new helper function to improve the calculation of the 8-bit address. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused variable 'neigh' from the 'dn_output()' function in the 'dn_route.c' file of the DECnet subsystem. Since the variable is assigned but not used anywhere else in the function, removing it does not affect the functionality or correctness of the code.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for VB2_DMABUF in the davinci vpbe driver. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical problem. Additionally, I would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch, and any other relevant details, so that I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a manual swapping operation with the `swap()` macro defined in `kernel.h`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability and maintainability, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on improving code readability and removing unnecessary casts and address-of operators. It does not fix any real or critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the `ioctl` function with `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. This change is specific to the `radio-bcm2048` driver and does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the variable name `PIDVEC_SIZE` to `max_items` in the `f2fs` file system's `gang_lookup_pids` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a simple renaming of a variable, which falls under the category of a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant condition check. The condition `(oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID)` is already checked in the previous line, so there is no need to check it again. The patch simply removes the redundant check and updates the code accordingly.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is in line with the driver-core's recommendation to use synchronous self-deletion of attributes instead of the asynchronous removal mechanism.

2. The patch removes the `sdev_store_delete_callback()` function, which was previously used as a callback for `device_schedule_callback()`. This function is no longer needed with the new approach.

3. The `sdev_store_delete()` function is modified to directly call `device_remove_file_self()` and then invoke `scsi_remove_device()` if the file removal is successful. This change ensures that the "delete" behavior is synchronous.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial cleanup that removes an unnecessary forward declaration. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any functional issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or security enhancements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a local variable "handle" in the acpi_pci_root_add() function. This local variable is assigned the value of "device->handle" and is then used in place of "device->handle" throughout the function.

The purpose of this change seems to be for economy of expression, as it reduces the number of times "device->handle" needs to be referenced. However, this change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Additionally, this change can be considered a trivial fix as it only involves introducing a local variable for code readability and does not impact the functionality or behavior of the code.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `platform_device_put` function call in the error path of `raumfeld_audio_init` function. This fix ensures that the platform device is properly released in case of an error during the `platform_device_add` call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for the McASPs on the davinci dm646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and have corresponding IRQ numbers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about a bug, error, or issue that it resolves. It simply adds interrupt resources for the McASPs.

Without additional context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in a stable release. Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only adds a conditional check for parsing DAPM routes in the simple-card driver. Since this is not a critical issue and does not fix any real problem, I would classify it as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to inconsistent indenting in the i915_error_state_to_str() function. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to add an option to skip sync on DMA map in the arch/avr32 folder. It mentions that the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC was not consistent across all DMA APIs in the arch/arm folder, and this change is meant to correct that for consistent behavior.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the avr32_dma_map_page() and avr32_dma_map_sg() functions in the arch/avr32/mm/dma-coherent.c file.

   In the avr32_dma_map_page() function:
   - The patch adds a check for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC in the attrs parameter.
   - If DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC is not set, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA buffer.

   In the avr32_dma_map_sg() function:
   - The patch adds a check for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC in the attrs parameter.
   - If DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC is set, it continues to the next scatterlist entry without calling dma_cache_sync().
   - Otherwise, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA buffer.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch seems to address a consistency issue in the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC in the arch/avr32 folder. It introduces an option to skip the synchronization of the CPU cache with the DMA buffer when the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC attribute is set.

   However, the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it fixes. It appears to be more of a code improvement rather than fixing a critical bug or addressing a security issue.

   Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, which require fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a security issue, this patch does not meet those criteria. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a calculation with the DIV_ROUND_UP macro. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for a specific USB device (PCTV 340eSE) to the dib0700 driver. This patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the name of a signal from "DE" to "DISP" in the rcar-du driver for the DRM subsystem. This change is made to clarify that the DISP pin outputs the DISP signal.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the IRQ handler function to the i2c section. This change is not related to fixing a real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes an indentation issue in the `struct amdgpu_ring` definition, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as indentation changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is adding a check for the status_code field in the ERSP_IU structure in the nvme_fc_fcpio_done() function in the fc.c file of the nvme host driver. 

Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose and impact of this change. However, based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is adding a necessary check for the status_code field, which could potentially address a real and critical bug related to error handling or data corruption in the NVMe over Fibre Channel (FC) driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. However, further review and testing by the appropriate maintainers and developers would be necessary to ensure the correctness and effectiveness of the patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the private copy of `struct net_device_stats` in `struct port_info` and instead uses the stats from `struct net_device`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves removing code that is not necessary.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the current code ignores the return value of the `ipmmu_iommu_init()` function. The patch suggests modifying the code to return the value of `ipmmu_iommu_init()` instead of always returning 0.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Without further information, it is difficult to assess the severity of the bug or the impact of the change. However, based on the patch description, it seems that the current code is not handling the failure case of `ipmmu_iommu_init()` correctly.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential error and improves error handling, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis would be required to confirm this decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new parameter "rw" to the function "__extent_read_full_page" in "extent_io.c". This parameter is used to specify the type of IO operation (READ or WRITE). This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch modifies the function "extent_read_full_page" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change also seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

3. The patch modifies the function "write_one_eb" to set the "rw" parameter as "WRITE" or "WRITE_SYNC" combined with "REQ_META". This change ensures that metadata IO is properly tagged and avoids priority inversion when using IO throttling cgroups. This fix addresses a potential issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.

4. The patch modifies the function "extent_readpages" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change is consistent with the previous modifications and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

5. The patch modifies the function "read_extent_buffer_pages" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" combined with "REQ_META" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change ensures that metadata IO is properly tagged and addresses a potential issue. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue related to metadata IO and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding initial support for the GP104 chipset in the Nouveau driver. However, the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial change as it only adds a single line to the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for distinguishing between i.MX23 and i.MX28 LRADC units in order to make the touchscreen work on i.MX23. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. It seems to be a specific fix for a particular hardware variant. 

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix default UVD context size" and is signed-off by Christian König, reviewed by Leo Liu and Alex Deucher, and signed-off again by Alex Deucher.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the "amdgpu_uvd_cs_msg_decode" function in the "amdgpu_uvd.c" file.

3. The specific change is in the declaration of the "min_ctx_size" variable. Previously, it was initialized to 0, but now it is initialized to the maximum value of an unsigned integer (~0).

4. The purpose of this change is to set the default UVD (Unified Video Decoder) context size to the maximum value, indicating that context buffers should be denied by default.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a specific issue related to the default UVD context size in the AMDGPU driver. While it may not directly address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does address an issue that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or suboptimal performance.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it does not seem to be a trivial fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the final decision should be made by the Linux kernel maintainers based on their expertise and the specific criteria for accepting patches into -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the ARM shmobile rcar-gen2 platform. It adds more register documentation and includes some changes to the register definitions and related functions.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a non-functional change that improves documentation and readability.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch disables the centroid pixel performance optimization in the BDW (Broadwell) driver for the Intel i915 graphics driver.
   - It is a workaround for BDW Bug #1899532.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new definition `GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS` in the `i915_reg.h` header file.
   - It also adds a new register write to `HALF_SLICE_CHICKEN3` in the `gen8_init_clock_gating` function of `intel_pm.c`.
   - Additionally, it includes a warning message if preliminary hardware support is not enabled.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific bug (BDW Bug #1899532) related to the BDW hardware.
   - It disables the centroid pixel optimization, which suggests that the optimization may cause issues or is not functioning correctly.
   - The warning message ensures that the patch is only applied when preliminary hardware support is enabled, indicating that it may not be needed for production hardware.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug specific to the BDW hardware. It disables a problematic optimization and includes a warning to ensure it is only applied when necessary. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new define, DEBUG_UART_SHIFT, and removes the variable "shift" from all functions in uncompress.h. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary casting. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary operation. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds defines for exit codes in the kselftest framework. It does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a struct in the drm/edid module. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the initialization of the 5/10MHz channel width on the ar9003 hardware for the ath9k driver. The patch moves the call to `ath9k_hw_set_rfmode()` after `ath9k_hw_process_ini()` to avoid overwriting the AR_PHY_MODE register with default values.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses an issue with the channel width initialization, which can impact the functionality of the ar9003 hardware.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a suspicious RCU usage warning in the net_sched module. The warning indicates a potential issue with RCU (Read-Copy-Update) usage in the code.

Since the patch addresses a warning related to RCU usage, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the display of mount options in /proc/mounts. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a message print when firmware fails to be requested in the case of platform data being used. This is a useful addition as it provides better visibility and debugging information for potential issues related to firmware requests.

2. The patch distinguishes between error messages for the device tree and platform data cases. This differentiation helps in identifying the source of the failure more accurately, which can be beneficial for troubleshooting and fixing the issue.

3. The patch includes the necessary error handling code to handle the failure case. If the firmware request fails, an error message is printed using the dev_err() function.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue related to firmware request failure, which can potentially lead to critical bugs or data corruption.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix a potential kernel panic issue caused by a recursive recovery during boot in the wlcore driver. The patch checks the state of the wlcore driver before queuing a new recovery work, ensuring that the hardware is not already stopped.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could lead to a kernel panic. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0` driver in the AMDGPU DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` status of the DCE (Display Core Engine) IP block accordingly.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue. 

From the patch, it seems that the `check_soft_reset` function is intended to prevent unnecessary soft resets when the display is not hung. This can potentially improve system stability and performance by avoiding unnecessary resets. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to assess the criticality of the problem being solved.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional details such as bug reports, discussions, or any relevant information from the Linux kernel community. Without such information, it is not possible to definitively determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, based solely on the provided patch, I would lean towards not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further information is available to assess the criticality and significance of the bug being fixed.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix involving spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the HID Wacom driver. The patch moves the report header check for the Wacom Graphire device to a more appropriate location. 

The patch itself does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific behavior related to the Wacom Graphire device. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. 

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential null pointer dereference issue in the staging/lustre/lnet/klnds/socklnd/socklnd.c file. The patch adds a null pointer check for the 'best_iface' variable at line 804 and line 840.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to a null pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the tpic2810 GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new function called `tpic2810_set` to the tpic2810 GPIO driver. This function is not directly related to the fix mentioned in the patch description, but it seems to be a necessary addition for the proper functioning of the driver. This is not a trivial fix.

2. The `tpic2810_direction_output` function is modified to call the newly added `tpic2810_set` function. This change ensures that the proper output level is set when the GPIO pin is configured as an output. This fix addresses a potential issue with incorrect output levels and can prevent unexpected behavior or data corruption. It is not a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to setting the proper output level in the tpic2810 GPIO driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing unnecessary calls to the `ipset_nest_end` function in the error paths of three different files (`ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`). 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it only removes some unnecessary function calls, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the acpi_power_meter driver that causes the kernel to crash when it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. The current code uses the BUG() macro, which triggers a kernel panic and crashes the system. The proposed patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, which generates a warning message but allows the system to continue running.

The use of the WARN() macro is appropriate in this case because the detected conditions, while indicating a bug in the code, are not fatal. By replacing the BUG() macro with WARN(), the patch prevents unnecessary kernel crashes and allows the system to handle the unexpected events gracefully.

The patch also includes additional error handling by setting a default value for the "val" variable when an unexpected attribute index is encountered. This ensures that the code does not return uninitialized or incorrect data.

Overall, the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause the kernel to crash and provides better error handling. It meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it addresses a real and critical issue without containing any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the function `core_dev_setup_virtual_lun0()` in the `target_core_device.c` file.

2. The patch changes the initialization of the `buf` variable from a fixed size array to an array initialized with the string "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1". This change sets the configuration parameters for the virtual_lun0 device.

3. The previous code used `memset()` and `sprintf()` to set the `buf` variable to "rd_pages=8". This change simplifies the code by directly initializing `buf` with the desired value.

4. The `buf` variable is then passed to `hba->transport->set_configfs_dev_params()` to set the configuration parameters for the device.

5. Finally, the function `target_configure_device()` is called to configure the device.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not appear to fix a critical bug or address any significant issues. It seems to be a configuration change for the virtual_lun0 device. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant assignment for the `gpio->da9052` variable in the `da9052_gpio_probe` function. This redundant assignment does not seem to cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical bugs.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical issue and contains a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that staticizes some symbols in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The symbols 'ab8500_alternate_functions' and 'ab8500_gpio_irq_cluster' are only used within this file, and the patch aims to silence warnings about them not being declared as static.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and it only addresses trivial warnings, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for setting a plane's rotation property from userspace in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a necessary hook for setting the rotation property of a plane from userspace. This indicates that it addresses a functionality gap or bug in the existing codebase.

2. The patch includes the necessary function assignment for the `set_property` hook to `drm_atomic_helper_plane_set_property()`. This ensures that the plane's rotation property can be properly set.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on the core functionality of adding support for setting the rotation property.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug or functionality gap, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the error code -ENOSYS with -EOPNOTSUPP for two stub operations in the greybus audio_apbridgea driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Qualcomm's PTM v1.1 peripheral ID to the coresight-etm3x driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   No, this patch does not fix a bug. It adds support for a new peripheral ID.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   No, this patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it address a real security issue?
   No, this patch does not address a security issue.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, this patch does not fix any such issue.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes?
   No, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite
   - The patch title suggests that it is related to the staging driver for Lustre filesystem.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description states that the file times should only be updated if page_mkwrite is not set.
   - It mentions that file_update_time needs to be called manually in this case.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including James Simmons and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change adds a call to file_update_time before the do-while loop in the ll_page_mkwrite function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to updating file times in the Lustre filesystem staging driver. However, without further context or details about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, the impact it has on the system, and whether it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the Linux kernel. The patch makes the `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs` arrays `const`, as they are only read and not modified. This change improves code clarity and can potentially help with compiler optimizations.

Additionally, the patch updates the `find_freq_tables()` function and its callsites to use `const struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs` instead of `struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs`. This change ensures that the `pxa_freqs` pointer is not modified within the function, which is a good practice for maintaining code correctness.

Overall, this patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an improvement in code readability and maintainability. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "staging: comedi: s626: remove I2CR and I2CW macros." It suggests removing the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros, which expand to the I2C read and write addresses, respectively. These macros are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `s626.c` file and the `s626.h` file.

3. Analysis:
   The purpose of this patch is to remove the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros and expand them in place. The macros are used in the `I2Cread` function in the `s626.c` file. The `I2Chandshake` function is called with the expanded values of these macros.

   The patch replaces the `I2CR` macro with `(devpriv->I2CAdrs | 1)` and the `I2CW` macro with `devpriv->I2CAdrs`. These changes make the code more readable and eliminate the need for the macros.

   The patch also removes the definitions of the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros from the `s626.h` file.

4. Decision:
   Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves code readability by removing unnecessary macros. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this decision is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not consider other factors that could influence the decision-making process.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds the flag ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK to the enqueue_task() function calls in four different places in the code.

2. The patch includes the explanation that in all cases where ENQUEUE_RESTORE is used, ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK should also be used because DEQUEUE_SAVE will have done an update_rq_clock().

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the enqueue_task() function calls. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue being addressed and its impact on the system's stability, security, or functionality.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver, allowing the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name. This change is important as clocks can be named differently on multiple platforms.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi and Roger Quadros. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has received approval from experts in the field.

In terms of the code changes, the patch modifies the code to use the generic clock names instead of the specific clock names. It also adds warning and error messages to handle cases where the generic clock names are not found, providing fallback options and suggesting fixes for the device tree.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with clock names and improves the flexibility and compatibility of the driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the criticality of the bug fix and the absence of trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch introduces a new callback function called `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio-pca953x` driver. This function is responsible for retrieving the direction of a GPIO pin. It uses the `pca953x_read_single()` function to read the register value and returns the direction based on the bit corresponding to the GPIO pin.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation and code cleanup patch rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch updates the comment in init.h and adds missing initcall_sync variants. While these changes may improve code clarity and maintainability, they do not address any specific issue causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding two WARN_ON statements to the code. These statements trigger a warning if certain conditions are not met. Specifically, the first WARN_ON statement triggers a warning if the IS_ULT macro returns false, and the second WARN_ON statement triggers a warning if the IS_ULT macro returns true.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not fix any of the mentioned critical issues. It only adds warning statements to the code. While these warnings may be useful for debugging or identifying potential issues, they do not fix any real and critical bugs.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the conditional logic to check for an error code instead of a success code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is merely a cosmetic change that improves the consistency of error messages.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and alignment. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and consistency. The patch only changes the line breaks after the ternary operator in two places. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function in the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset. The function `s_vGetFreeContext` is renamed to `vnt_get_free_context`. 

Since this patch only involves a function name change and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash due to a null dereference and adds error handling for a failed kzalloc allocation. This patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to a crash, making it a candidate for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a channel mismatch issue in the ASoC ak4642 driver. The patch updates the minimum number of channels for both playback and capture streams from 1 to 2, aligning it with the actual capabilities of the ak4642 codec.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect audio channel configuration, it can be considered a valid fix. However, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. The change does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the ethtool API usage in the virtio_net driver. The patch replaces the deprecated ethtool {get|set}_settings API with the new {get|set}_link_ksettings API.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch replaces the usage of smp_mb() with smp_store_mb/release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin/end() functions in arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c.

2. Code Changes: The patch replaces the smp_mb() call with smp_store_mb() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() function and replaces the smp_mb() call with smp_store_release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() function.

3. Purpose: The purpose of these changes is to ensure proper memory ordering and synchronization when modifying the vcpu->mode variable.

4. Impact Analysis: The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a performance optimization by replacing smp_mb() with more specific memory barrier functions.

5. Triviality: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any real issues. It seems to be a performance optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the `perf report` command in the Linux kernel. The patch adds information about an optional `print_limit` argument for the `--call-graph` command line option.

Since this patch only affects the documentation and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue related to the deletion of queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch uses the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues to determine if a queue was created.

3. The patch ensures that the controller returns an invalid queue identifier error to commands if a queue wasn't created.

4. The patch has been reported by Saar Gross and reviewed by Christoph Hellwig.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the deletion of queues in the NVMe driver. It improves the correctness of the code by using the online queue count and properly handling the case when a queue wasn't created. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the blackfin PTP driver. The patch converts the gettime and settime functions to use struct timespec64 instead of struct timespec, allowing the driver to handle 64-bit nanoseconds and be ready for the year 2038.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to handling time in the blackfin PTP driver and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new macro called VA_START to replace the lengthy expression (UL(0xffffffffffffffff) << VA_BITS) used in multiple places. The purpose of this change is to improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the bcm-kona GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds two new functions: `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` and `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown`. These functions are responsible for locking and unlocking the hardware IRQ associated with the GPIO line.

2. The `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` function locks the hardware IRQ using the `gpio_lock_as_irq` function. If the lock is successful, the function proceeds to unmask the IRQ using `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_unmask`. If the lock fails, it logs an error message.

3. The `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown` function masks the IRQ using `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_mask` and unlocks the hardware IRQ using `gpio_unlock_as_irq`.

4. The `bcm_gpio_irq_chip` structure is updated to include the new `irq_startup` and `irq_shutdown` function pointers, pointing to the newly added functions.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is fixing a real issue related to locking and unlocking the hardware IRQs in the bcm-kona GPIO driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functionality and addresses a potential issue with IRQ handling.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call initializes the "icount" structure to all zeros, but since the structure is allocated using kzalloc, it is already zero-initialized. Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a trivial fix (removing unnecessary code), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the soc_camera driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for reading from the video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix.

2. It also adds a debug line, which can be useful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes. However, it is not critical for fixing any real issues.

3. The patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() in the rcutorture test. The purpose of this change is to test the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

Since this patch is specific to the rcutorture test and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a compile issue in the obd_mount.c file of the Lustre staging driver. The issue is related to the variable "index" not being initialized before it is used in the lmd_make_exclusion function.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it can be considered a real and critical bug. However, it does not seem to cause any oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a non-trivial issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check that is not doing anything useful. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the .owner field for the spi-armada-3700 driver. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes a single line of code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). The patch description does not provide any details about the bug being fixed or the impact it has on the system. Additionally, the patch itself only adds a handler function to a specific command complete event, without any further context.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being addressed and its severity.
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to make the OVSP_LOCAL constant in the openvswitch.h header file a 32-bit value instead of a 16-bit value. The justification for this change is that OVS ports are now 32-bit, so OVSP_LOCAL should also be 32-bit.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix that changes the size of a constant value.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless initialization of the variable 'ret'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the AR9485 initvals in the ath9k driver. However, without further context or information about the bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug being fixed and any relevant details to help me make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a kmalloc() call with kzalloc(). The patch does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds error handling for panel initialization in the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential issue related to panel initialization.

2. The patch also groups mutex initialization at a single place, which improves code organization and readability.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ricardo Neri and Tomi Valkeinen, indicating that it has undergone review and approval.

4. The changes made in the patch are within the hdmi.c file, specifically in the omapdss_hdmihw_probe() function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to panel initialization in the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. It also improves code organization by grouping mutex initialization. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the plane state during initialization in the "intel_find_initial_plane_obj" function.
2. It sets the primary plane's frame buffer (fb) to the provided fb.
3. It updates the primary plane's crtc and state to point to the intel_crtc base.
4. It calls the "update_state_fb" function to update the state of the primary plane's frame buffer.
5. It updates the plane mask of the intel_crtc base state to include the primary plane.
6. In the "intel_modeset_gem_init" function, it initializes the gem (Graphics Execution Manager) for the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) device.
7. It checks each crtc and if it has a primary plane, it sets the primary plane's crtc and state to NULL.
8. It calls the "update_state_fb" function to update the state of the primary plane's frame buffer.
9. It updates the plane mask of the crtc state to exclude the primary plane.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to be fixing the plane state during initialization and correctly updating the plane mask. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves updating the state of the primary plane and the plane mask of the crtc state.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch moves duplicated callback functions from the codec driver to the component driver in the ASoC subsystem for the wm9713 codec. This change improves code organization and eliminates the need for redundant code.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it addresses a real issue by improving code structure, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that modifies the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions in `net/mac802154/iface.c`. 

The patch changes the increment and decrement of `open_count` in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions, respectively. It replaces the `local->open_count++` increment with `!local->open_count` check and replaces the `--local->open_count` decrement with `local->open_count--`.

Since this patch only involves a cleanup of the code and does not fix any real and critical bug, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the use of WARN_ON() in the srpt_abort_cmd() function in the ib_srpt.c file.

2. The current code uses WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state"), which is not the intended usage of WARN_ON(). While it will work, it is not clear what the actual state value is.

3. The patch replaces the incorrect usage with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state), which provides more useful information by showing the actual "state" value.

4. The change improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message, making it easier to understand and debug potential issues related to unexpected command states.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch addresses a real issue and improves the code's clarity and maintainability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the issue described. The patch adds the `__must_check` attribute to the declarations of `dvb_usb_generic_rw()` and `dvb_usb_generic_write()` functions in `dvb-usb.h`. This attribute indicates that the return values of these functions must be checked, ensuring that the drivers handle errors correctly.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior in the drivers, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces deprecated operations with their recommended counterparts. The patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix a bit toggling issue in the ixgbe driver for the 82599 network card. The current code does not toggle the correct bit to reset the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, including Don Skidmore, Phil Schmitt, Aaron Brown, and David S. Miller.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the ixgbe_reset_pipeline_82599 function in the ixgbe_82599.c file. Specifically, it updates the AUTOC register by toggling the LMS[2] bit and Restart_AN.

4. Analysis: The patch appears to address a specific issue related to resetting the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion for the 82599 network card. It modifies the AUTOC register by toggling the correct bit using the XOR operator.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the bit toggling issue. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error when the PM_SLEEP is disabled. The issue is reported by Rhyland Klein and the patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Nvidia.

However, this patch seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only adds the "static inline" keyword to the function definition. It does not address any critical bug, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the assignment of the current task's state in the ipc/sem.c file. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a compile-time check for the size of the struct bt_skb_cb within the limits of skb->cb. This check ensures that the size of the struct does not exceed the size of skb->cb.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a module option "nested" to kvm_intel, which controls whether the guest can use VMX instructions, enabling or disabling nested virtualization.
2. The option currently defaults to 0, meaning nested VMX must be explicitly enabled by giving nested=1.
3. The patch includes a function "nested_vmx_allowed" that checks whether a guest should be allowed to use VMX instructions and MSRs (nested VMX).
4. The function checks if the "nested" module option is enabled and if the guest has the VMX cpuid bit enabled.
5. The patch also includes a function "guest_cpuid_has_vmx" that checks if the guest has the VMX cpuid bit enabled.
6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, the patch addresses a real and critical issue by adding support for nested virtualization in kvm_intel. It does not introduce any trivial changes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes some typos in the netvsc.c file, it appears to be a trivial fix involving spelling changes. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a compatible string for the Amlogic Meson I2C controller. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves making local symbols static. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the "remain" variable from int to unsigned long in the wmi_call function of the wil6210 driver. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (changing a variable type), I would classify this patch as a NAK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to missing sanity checks on the version-request payload size in the greybus driver. This could potentially lead to a build error, data corruption, or a security issue. 

The patch adds a check to ensure that the payload size is not smaller than the expected size of the version request structure. If the payload size is smaller, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or security vulnerabilities, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the Nouveau graphics driver. The patch aims to identify the MMU (Memory Management Unit) engine IDs for host faults.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch drops the NVKM_ENGINE_FIFO data from the entries and suggests that resetting all of PFIFO is not the appropriate way to handle such faults. This indicates that the patch addresses a potential issue related to handling faults in the graphics driver.

2. The patch adds new entries to the gk104_fifo_fault_engine array, which represents the mapping of engine IDs to their respective names. These new entries include "DISPLAY," "CAPTURE," "SCHED," and several "HOST" entries. This suggests that the patch introduces support for additional engine types and improves the identification of engine faults.

3. The patch also adds an entry for "PTP," which could potentially refer to Precision Time Protocol. However, without further context, it is unclear how this entry relates to the overall functionality of the graphics driver.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to fault handling in the Nouveau graphics driver. It introduces improvements in identifying engine faults and adds support for additional engine types. However, without more information about the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine the criticality of the problem being addressed.

Considering the provided information, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug. However, a more thorough evaluation by the Linux kernel maintainers would be necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the Rockchip PCIe controller. The patch sets the Common Clock Configuration bit in the Link Control Register to indicate that Rockchip's RC is using a common clock architecture.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds an unregister function for sunxi's factors clk, which was missing previously. This is a bug fix.

2. The unregister function frees the pointers to the mux and gate structs, preventing memory leaks.

3. The patch also adds the unregister function declaration in the header file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for plymouth issues on certain EFI MacBooks. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the `nv50_bar_init` function in the `nv50.c` file under the `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/subdev/bar` directory.

2. The patch adds a new variable `i` of type `int` to the function.

3. Inside the function, a loop is added that iterates from 0 to 7 (inclusive) using the `i` variable.

4. Within the loop, a write operation is performed using the `nv_wr32` function to write a value of `0x00000000` to the register address `0x001900 + (i * 4)`.

5. The function then returns 0.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes certain registers to zero.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the PHY polling code from the atl1c_open function in the atl1c_main.c file. The reasoning behind this change is that the FPGA PHY polling code is already considered in every MDIO R/W API, so there is no need to add additional code in atl1c_open.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather removes unnecessary code, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the "crc_errors" statistic to "rx_crc_errors" in the i40e driver.

It seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the code shorter and less ugly. It replaces the existing code block with a single function call, iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp(), passing the necessary arguments.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential buffer overflow issue by replacing the use of sprintf() with snprintf(). This change ensures that the buffer size is respected and prevents potential buffer overflows.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it addresses a potential issue that falls under the "oh, that's not good" category. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NULL assignment from two global variables.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the POD X3 Live USB device in the ALSA line6 driver. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for a new USB device.

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not fixing a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "mfd: arizona" driver. The patch allows the CODEC DAPM context to be accessed elsewhere by exporting it from the core driver. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the driver registration order in the staging/comedi/drivers/das08_cs.c file. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character to a debug message. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only adds a single line of code to compute the `struct net` from the input device in `ip_forward`. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the function `CsrUInt16ToHex` from `csr_util.c` to `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`. The function itself is not modified, and there is no indication of any critical bug fix or significant improvement.

Since the patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch modifies the function `btrfs_add_nondir` to take `struct btrfs_inode` instead of `struct inode` as arguments. However, there is no indication that this change addresses any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a definition for the MAC_SM_RST register value, which represents the reset bit of the MAC status machine register.

2. In the function `r6040_init_mac_regs`, the patch replaces the hardcoded value `2` with the newly defined `MAC_SM_RST` when resetting the internal state machine.

3. Similarly, in the function `r6040_mac_address`, the patch replaces the hardcoded value `2` with `MAC_SM_RST` when resetting the internal state machine.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to resetting the internal state machine of the MAC. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bug or issue, it seems to be a valid fix for potential problems related to the MAC status machine.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new flag `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_1HZ` for 1 Hz resolution to the V4L2 tuner capabilities. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial fix as it only adds a new flag without any significant code changes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing redundant assignments and correcting indentation. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the deprecated function `create_singlethread_workqueue()` is being replaced with `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` with the `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM` flag set. The purpose of this change is to ensure forward progress under memory pressure.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather replaces a deprecated function with a more appropriate one, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freeing resources in perf probe events. The patch adds a call to `clear_perf_probe_event()` in the `cleanup_perf_probe_events()` function, ensuring that resources related to perf probe events are properly freed.

Since this patch addresses a bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a necessary change to add the `dma_dir` parameter to the `alloc` function in the `vb2_mem_ops` structure. This change allows the `dma-sg` alloc memop to know the `dma_dir`, which is required for a subsequent patch.

Since this patch is not a trivial fix and it addresses a specific issue related to DMA direction, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds some informational print statements to the simplefb driver. The added code does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "nice to have" addition for debugging purposes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unnecessary call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The patch mentions that the IRQ is allocated with `devm_request_irq`, indicating that the IRQ is managed by the device model and does not need to be explicitly freed.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Since the patch only removes an unnecessary call to `free_irq`, it does not fix any real and critical bug or address any of the mentioned issues. It also does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The patch correctly addresses the issue by shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real bug that could potentially cause issues such as incorrect power state handling, which can lead to audio problems or system instability. Additionally, the fix does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add variable resolution support to the gspca driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for variable resolution by allowing subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions. This indicates that it introduces a new feature to the gspca driver.

2. The try_fmt function is called in the try_fmt_vid_cap function to pass the original resolution to the subdriver. This suggests that the patch modifies the behavior of the try_fmt function.

3. The vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function sets the current mode and pixfmt based on the return value of the try_fmt function. If the try_fmt function is not present, it falls back to the existing behavior.

4. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function calls the enum_framesizes function if it is present, allowing the subdriver to handle frame size enumeration.

5. The patch also adds two new function pointers, cam_format_op and cam_frmsize_op, to the sd_desc structure in gspca.h. These function pointers are used to define the try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch introduces a new feature to the gspca driver by adding support for variable resolution. It modifies the behavior of the try_fmt function and allows subdrivers to handle frame size enumeration. However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "nice-to-have" feature rather than a critical fix.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __dev* attributes. This change is related to the removal of the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option and the __dev* markings. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a checkpatch.pl warning about a line being over 80 characters. This type of fix falls under the category of "trivial" and does not fix a real and critical bug or issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only renames the `enum dio200_layout` to `enum dio200_layout_idx`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change that improves the display of vendor information for imported USB devices.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices. The patch adds a new rate_update hook in the rate control algorithm and re-initializes the rate scaling (rs) when the hook is called.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: It seems that the patch addresses a bug related to rate scaling, which can impact the performance and stability of the wireless connection. Therefore, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues. However, rate scaling is an essential component of wireless communication, and a bug in this area can lead to degraded performance and reliability, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a new functionality and modifies existing code to address the bug.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It also falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves removing redundant code.

Therefore, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp`) than the original `dentry`. In this case, the patch assumes that the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. The comment in the code suggests that if the dentry has been renamed, it must have been looked up and connected, so the function can exit.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the physical address information to the vm_struct for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix potential issues related to NULL pointer handling in the bcm2835-audio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch replaces NULL values returned by vc_vchi_audio_init(...) with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it allows for better error handling and provides more specific information about the failure. The error pointer values returned (-EINVAL, -ENOMEM, -EPERM) indicate different types of errors that can occur during initialization.

2. The patch also replaces a NULL check where vc_vchi_audio_init(...) is called with IS_ERR(..). This change ensures that the error pointer values returned by vc_vchi_audio_init(...) are properly handled.

3. The patch includes proper error handling and cleanup code. If the number of connections exceeds the maximum allowed, it returns ERR_PTR(-EINVAL). If kzalloc fails to allocate memory, it returns ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM). If the VCHI service connection fails to open, it returns ERR_PTR(-EPERM). These error values provide more information about the specific failure, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting.

4. The patch also includes appropriate error handling in the bcm2835_audio_open_connection function. It checks if the instance returned by vc_vchi_audio_init is an error pointer using IS_ERR and handles the error accordingly.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses potential issues related to NULL pointer handling and improves error reporting in the bcm2835-audio driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only removes unused code, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the way the DRM_MINOR_* constants are defined. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "s390/vmur: Link parent CCW device during UR device creation." It suggests a modification to the code related to the creation of virtual unit record (UR) devices on the s390 architecture.

2. Patch Details: The patch modifies the code in the `ur_set_online` function in the `vmur.c` file. Specifically, it changes the `device_create` function call by adding the parent CCW device (`cdev->dev`) as the second argument.

3. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to address a specific issue related to the creation of UR devices on the s390 architecture. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the issue.

4. Criteria Evaluation: To determine whether the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, we need to assess if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

5. Decision: Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively determine if the patch addresses a critical bug or if it contains any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers before making a decision.

Answer: (B) The patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further investigation or clarification is obtained.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code related to setting the power state of a device. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command in the Linux kernel. This option allows for explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. The patch also includes the necessary changes in the code to handle this new option.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for a critical bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the dm_thin_find_block() function in the dm-thin-metadata.c file. The race condition occurs when checking the fail_io flag outside the metadata device's root_lock, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect behavior. It is not a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the NOHZ local_softirq_pending issue in the dp83640 driver. The patch replaces the netif_rx() function call with netif_rx_ni() to ensure it is used from process/softirq context.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Since the patch addresses a warning related to the NOHZ local_softirq_pending issue, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. It appears to be more of a warning fix rather than a fix for a real and critical bug.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add debug error messages to report command timeout in the liquidio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a timeout error message in the function `lio_process_ordered_list()` in the liquidio driver. This is useful for debugging and can help identify issues related to command timeouts. It falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue, as it provides valuable information about potential problems.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the function `if_cfg_callback()`. This enhances the error message by including additional information about the failure status. It can be helpful for troubleshooting and identifying the cause of the failure.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real issue and provides valuable debug information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the redundant use of the of_match_ptr() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming variables and converting enums into defines. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a constify patch, which means it is making the of_device_id arrays const. This change ensures that the arrays are treated as read-only and cannot be modified accidentally.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and it only contains a "trivial" fix (constify), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

     - Before: { RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE), 8, GEN_RANGE(4, 8) }
     - After: { RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE), 8, GEN_RANGE(4, 9) }
   - The modification extends the supported gens range from 4 to 8 to 4 to 9.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a targeted fix for the i915 driver, specifically for Intel Skylake GPUs. It modifies the whitelist entry to extend the supported gens range. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch introduces a locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function in the `drm/nouveau/abi16` module. The purpose of this patch is to provide limited interoperability for USIF by granting access to ABI16 data.

The changes made in the patch include:
- Renaming the original `nouveau_abi16_get()` function to `nouveau_abi16()` and making it static.
- Implementing a new `nouveau_abi16_get()` function that acquires the client mutex, calls `nouveau_abi16()` (the renamed function), and returns the `abi16` data if it exists.
- Unlocking the client mutex before returning `NULL` if `nouveau_abi16()` returns false.

Based on the provided information, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to providing limited interoperability for USIF.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes socket-specific code from l2cap_core.c. This change seems to be a cleanup or refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, it can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be included in a stable release. 

2. The patch moves the check for backlog size to l2cap_sock.c. This change seems to be related to improving the handling of the backlog size in the Bluetooth subsystem. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if this change addresses a real and critical bug or an issue that could lead to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. 

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this change fixes a critical issue or just improves the code. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in a stable release (NAK) until further information or justification is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call is used to initialize memory allocated with vzalloc, but since vzalloc already zeroes out the allocated memory, the memset call is redundant.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the function signature of `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change is made to prevent compiler errors when `CONFIG_REGULATOR` is not defined.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, it is considered a trivial fix as it only involves a signature mismatch.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve deferring the building of the OSD request until just before submitting it in multiple callers. While this may improve code organization and readability, it does not address any specific issue or bug.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the Gemini Lake platform to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake platform by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the `intel_pstate_cpu_ids` array.

2. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical bug. It appears to be adding support for a new platform, which is not considered a critical bug fix.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new advertising setting in the Bluetooth subsystem. This patch introduces the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag and modifies the "set_advertising" function to handle this new flag.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch extends the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Olli Salonen and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `frequency_min` value in the `si2157_ops` structure from 110000000 to 55000000.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is extending the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. This change does not seem to fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change seems to be a trivial fix as it only modifies a numerical value.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the '0x' notation when using the %pad format. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes forward declarations of the `struct super_block` in multiple files. Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial forward declarations, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills for the ARM64 architecture. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch adds missing L2 cache events for read/write accesses and misses, as well as DTLB refills. These additions are relevant to monitoring and analyzing system performance, which can be critical for debugging and optimizing the system.

The patch also includes the necessary mappings for the added events in the `armv8_a53_perf_cache_map` array. This ensures that the events are correctly associated with the corresponding performance counters.

Considering the criteria for acceptance, this patch does not appear to be a trivial fix. It addresses missing cache events and DTLB refills, which can have a significant impact on system performance analysis and debugging. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding a check to ensure that encryption policies can only be set on directories in the ext4 filesystem. This check is being added to the `ext4_process_policy` function in the `fs/ext4/crypto_policy.c` file.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential misuse of encryption policies by restricting their application to directories only.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a -stable release, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for migrating to the generic clk framework API. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds the necessary clk_prepare/clk_unprepare calls to the audmux driver in the ARM mxc platform.
2. The patch is signed-off by Richard Zhao and Sascha Hauer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
3. The changes in the patch are limited to the audmux driver file (arch/arm/plat-mxc/audmux-v2.c), which suggests that it is a targeted fix for a specific issue.
4. The patch modifies the audmux_read_file and mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port functions.
5. In both functions, the patch replaces the clk_enable and clk_disable calls with clk_prepare_enable and clk_disable_unprepare calls, respectively.
6. The patch ensures that the audmux_clk is prepared and enabled before accessing the audmux_base registers and disabled after the access is complete.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to clock handling in the audmux driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to be a critical fix that could potentially cause issues such as hangs or data corruption if not applied. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a local variable and using a helper function to validate trigger arguments. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for a special WHEA _OSC call that is required to turn on APEI firmware first mode on certain machines. This is necessary to ensure that there is a GHES hardware error record for hardware error notification.

2. The patch includes a new function called "apei_osc_setup" that performs the necessary setup for the WHEA _OSC call. It retrieves the ACPI handle, sets up the necessary context, and runs the _OSC call. If the call is successful, it frees the allocated memory and returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -EIO.

3. The patch exports the "apei_osc_setup" function as a GPL symbol.

4. In the "ghes_init" function in the "ghes.c" file, the "apei_osc_setup" function is called. Depending on the return value of the function, different informational messages are printed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds necessary functionality to enable APEI firmware first mode on certain machines. This is important for proper hardware error notification. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for increasing the scan timeout in the iwlwifi driver. The patch increases the timeout from 7 seconds to 15 seconds to avoid aborting a scan that may take longer than expected.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to scan timeouts, it can be considered a critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK hack in the Linux kernel's scheduler. The patch introduces a new attribute, attr::sched_flags, to properly handle the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.

The patch modifies the sched_setscheduler() and sched_setscheduler_nocheck() functions to use the new attribute and handle the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag correctly. It also introduces a new helper function, _sched_setscheduler(), to handle the fixup of the legacy hack.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to address a real issue related to the scheduler and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is adding a new variable called "neg_one" with an initial value of -1. The patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that this change is intended to fix. Additionally, the patch does not provide any justification for why this change is necessary or how it addresses any critical bug or issue.

Given that the patch does not appear to fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds a new variable without any clear purpose or justification, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a conversion from the legacy SKB paged frag API to the newer SKB frag API. This type of patch typically falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves code cleanup and does not address any real or critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch seem to be related to fixing erroneous defines and adding new defines for reset pin controls.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the shmobile_init_delay() function in the ARM shmobile platform. The current implementation uses of_find_compatible_node() to find the CPU nodes and retrieve clock frequencies. However, this function returns a new reference to the found node, which leads to reference leakage if not properly released.

The patch proposes a solution by replacing the of_find_compatible_node() calls with of_device_is_compatible() inside a loop over the CPU nodes. This change simplifies the code and reduces complexity from O(n) to O(1). Additionally, it adds proper reference handling by using of_node_put() to release the references to the nodes.

The patch also introduces two boolean variables, is_a8_a9 and is_a15, to track the presence of specific CPU types. Depending on the CPU type and the availability of the ARM_ARCH_TIMER configuration, the shmobile_setup_delay_hz() function is called with appropriate parameters.

Overall, the patch fixes a real bug related to reference leakage and improves the code's efficiency. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to modify the cache push and clear code for the ColdFire architecture with MMU enabled. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the cache push and clear code specifically for the ColdFire V4e architecture with MMU enabled. This suggests that it addresses a specific issue or optimization related to this architecture.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. In the cache_clear function, the patch adds a condition to check if the CPU is a ColdFire architecture. If true, it calls the flush_cf_bcache function to flush the branch cache. This change seems to be specific to the ColdFire architecture and may address a potential issue or optimization.

4. Similarly, in the cache_push function, the patch adds a condition to check if the CPU is a ColdFire architecture. If true, it also calls the flush_cf_bcache function. Again, this change seems to be specific to the ColdFire architecture.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue or optimization related to the ColdFire architecture with MMU enabled. Since it does not appear to be a trivial fix and is specific to a particular architecture, it could be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that resets the sequence number on endpoint enable to stay in sync with the host. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bug or issue, it does address a potential synchronization problem.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply migrates the jazz driver to a new 'set-state' interface provided by the clockevents core, without providing any set-state callbacks.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and does not introduce any significant improvements or bug fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a code cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rt2x00: rt2800pci: fix AUX_CTRL register setup for RT3090/3390/3593/5592". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for specific RT2X00 wireless chips.

2. The patch references the functions "rt28xx_init" in "common/rtmp_init_intf.c" and "RTMPInitPCIeLinkCtrlValue" in "os/linux/rt_rbus_pci_drv.c". These references indicate that the patch is modifying the initialization of the PCIe link control value for the specified wireless chips.

3. The patch includes changes to the "rt2800pci_init_registers" function in "drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2800pci.c". Specifically, it adds support for enabling PCIe wakeup for the RT3090, RT3390, RT3593, RT5392, and RT5592 chips.

4. The condition for enabling PCIe wakeup is based on the chip type, specifically checking if the chip is one of the specified types.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for the mentioned wireless chips. It introduces support for enabling PCIe wakeup for these chips, which could potentially fix a critical bug or improve functionality.

Considering the patch's focus on fixing a specific issue and its potential impact on the affected wireless chips, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The change made in the patch is to fix an off-by-one error in the loop condition, which avoids an unnecessary delay in the final iteration of the loop.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by replacing "if (foo == false)" with "if (!foo)". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change and whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `freezable_schedule_timeout_killable()` function in the PM/Freezer subsystem. The patch correctly modifies the function to return the value from `schedule_timeout_killable()` instead of `freezer_count()`. 

Since the current callers of this function ignore the return code, the bug is considered harmless. However, the patch is still worth applying to ensure correctness and maintain consistency.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the ACPICA disassembler. The patch adds warnings for unresolved control methods, which can help identify cases where the disassembler is unable to determine the number of arguments to parse for method invocations.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for 1080p capture at 2 fps and 5 fps to webcam emulation in the vivid driver. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the Bluetooth management interface. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that it fixes the return parameters for the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management interface. This indicates that it addresses a specific bug or issue.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

3. The patch also includes an "Acked-by" line from Marcel Holtmann, indicating that he has reviewed and approved the patch specifically for the "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" file.

4. Looking at the code changes, the patch introduces a new variable "type" of type u8.

5. In the "mgmt_start_discovery_failed" function, the patch modifies the "cmd_complete" function call to include the "type" variable as an additional parameter.

6. In the "mgmt_discovering" function, the patch modifies the "cmd_complete" function call to include the "type" variable as an additional parameter, but only if the "discovering" variable is true.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the return parameters of the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management interface. It introduces a new variable and modifies the "cmd_complete" function calls to include the "type" parameter. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the issue.

Given the information provided, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being fixed would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unreachable code block. The removed code block contains a pr_debug() statement that will never be executed. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unreachable code), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes an issue where "byPacketType" is not set at all. This indicates a potential bug that could cause unexpected behavior or errors.

2. The patch includes a change to the function "CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate" to check "basic_rates" instead of "wBasicRate". This change seems to address a potential issue with checking the basic rates, which could be critical for proper functionality.

3. The patch also includes a new line of code that sets "byPacketType" by calling "CARDbyGetPktType". This addition suggests that the patch aims to fix a missing or incorrect value for "byPacketType", which could be a critical bug affecting packet handling.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses real and critical bugs related to packet handling and basic rate checking. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The purpose of this change is to accommodate the upcoming support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will modify the condition for TCP sockets. By introducing the helper function, the code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand.

Since this patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to TCP socket behavior, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Linux kernel. The patch is modifying the code in the `__put_ioctx` function in the `fs/aio.c` file.

The patch replaces the usage of `cancel_delayed_work` and `cancel_work_sync` with `cancel_delayed_work_sync`. This change ensures that any delayed work scheduled on the `ctx->wq` workqueue is canceled and waits for the cancellation to complete before proceeding.

Since this patch is fixing a potential issue related to canceling delayed work, it can be considered a valid fix for a potential hang or data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the DRM/i915 driver. Additionally, there is a small refactoring for gen2 in the for_each_pipe loop. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. 

From the patch description and code changes, it does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It appears to be adding functionality and making some minor code improvements. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to avoid an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf in the dw-mipi-dsi driver for Rockchip. It also explicitly encodes the endianness instead of casting a u16.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by John Keeping and Sean Paul.

3. Link: The patch can be found at http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20170224125506.21533-7-john@metanate.com,drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/dw-mipi-dsi.c

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the dw_mipi_dsi_dcs_short_write function in the dw-mipi-dsi driver. It changes the type of tx_buf from u16 to u8 and introduces a new variable, data, of type u16. It also modifies the logic for encoding the endianness explicitly.

5. Analysis: The patch addresses a potential out-of-bounds read on tx_buf by correctly encoding the endianness. It also adds a check for the length of the tx_buf to prevent buffer overflows. These changes seem to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or security issues.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "tcp: Validate route interface in early demux" and is signed-off by David S. Miller. It modifies the tcp_v4_early_demux function in the net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c file.

The patch introduces a new variable "dev" of type struct net_device and assigns it the value of skb->dev. It then uses this variable to check if the route interface matches the incoming interface index before setting the skb destination.

Based on the provided code, it appears that the patch aims to validate the route interface in the early demux process to avoid violating reverse path filtering.

To make a decision, we need to consider if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug being fixed. Without further context or information about the bug, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further analysis and information are required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes a static variable to 0. This change is only to address a checkpatch error related to initializing statics to 0 or NULL.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to fix a bug related to the port offset for DMEM registers in the drm/nouveau/falcon driver. It modifies the code that writes and reads data to/from the DMEM registers.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems that the original code had an incorrect offset calculation for the port. The patch corrects this by multiplying the port value by 8 instead of 16 in the relevant lines of code.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this bug fix addresses a critical issue or a real security concern. However, it does seem to fix an issue related to incorrect port offset calculation, which could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems.

Considering the lack of specific details about the bug and its impact, it is challenging to make a definitive decision. However, assuming that the bug fix is addressing a real and critical issue, and there are no trivial changes in the patch, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch changes the value of GEN6_RP_DOWN_TIMEOUT to decimal. This change aligns with the use of decimal values for other RP magic values in the codebase. It is not a trivial fix as it involves changing the value and maintaining consistency.

2. The order of register writes is changed to match the BIOS spec for easier verification. This change improves the code's readability and makes it easier to verify against the BIOS spec. It is not a trivial fix as it involves reordering the register writes.

3. The patch does not introduce any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes.

4. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an issue related to the RP (Render Power) configuration in the Intel graphics driver. While not critical, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it improves the code's consistency and alignment with the BIOS spec.

Considering the above analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is related to the Intel i915 graphics driver. The patch removes the setting of the fence number in the DPFC_CTL register on Sandy Bridge (SNB) platforms.

The patch includes a clear explanation stating that the fence number in DPFC_CTL must be 0 on SNB, as documented. It further mentions that when the fence number is not zero, the GTT (Graphics Translation Table) tracking does not work correctly.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the GTT tracking on SNB platforms. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves removing a setting that is causing a functional problem.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of a variable from `phys_t` to `phys_addr_t`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with the DAPM widget IO operations in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the component mutex is held during these operations, which helps prevent potential race conditions and ensures proper synchronization.

It seems to address a potential issue that could lead to synchronization problems, but it does not fall into the category of a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a NULL check for platform data, which is important for preventing potential issues caused by incorrect driver setup.
2. The check ensures that only a single ramoops area is allowed at a time, preventing extra probes.
3. The patch also includes a check to ensure that the platform data pointer is not NULL, which helps avoid potential issues caused by a bogus pointer.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Overall, the patch addresses potential issues and improves the stability and reliability of the ramoops functionality. It does not introduce any unnecessary changes or trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid CamelCase naming convention. This is a trivial fix and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch is signed-off by Leo Kim, Tony Cho, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. In the `struct scan_attr`, the `pfScanResult` member is renamed to `result`.

4. In the `Handle_Scan` function, the `pfUserScanResult` member of `strWILC_UsrScanReq` is assigned the value of `result` from `pstrHostIFscanAttr`. This is a direct replacement of the member name and does not fix any real or critical bug.

5. In the `host_int_scan` function, the `pfScanResult` member of `msg.body.scan_info` is assigned the value of `ScanResult`. This is also a direct replacement of the member name and does not fix any real or critical bug.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real or critical bug and only performs a trivial renaming of member variables. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch switches the usage of the `iterate` field to `iterate_shared` in the `file_operations` structure for various file systems. This change eliminates the need to lock the directory in `dcache_dir_lseek()` and instead relies on per-struct file exclusion.

Since this patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect error message in the ext4_ext_insert_index function.

Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds spaces around the '>>' operator to comply with the checkpatch tool's preference. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves some deallocations from the `regulator_unregister` function to the `regulator_dev_release` function. This is done to utilize the class device lifetime management features more effectively.

2. In the `regulator_dev_release` function, the patch adds two deallocations:
   - `kfree(rdev->constraints)` frees the memory allocated for `rdev->constraints`.
   - `of_node_put(rdev->dev.of_node)` releases the reference to the device tree node.

3. In the `regulator_unregister` function, the patch removes the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and `of_node_put(rdev->dev.of_node)`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it is a code refactoring to improve the utilization of class device lifetime management features.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE for the of_device table in the palmas driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the L2CAP protocol in Bluetooth. The patch ensures that if the remote device sends data without having any credits, the appropriate L2CAP Disconnect request is sent. This addresses a violation of the L2CAP specification.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a section mismatch warning in the pmagb-b-fb driver. The warning indicates that the function pmagbbfb_probe() references the function pmagbbfb_erase_cursor() with an incorrect section annotation. The patch removes the incorrect `__init` annotation from the pmagbbfb_erase_cursor() function, resolving the section mismatch issue.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros. These macros are described as "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscate the code." Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial macros, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section conflict in mm/percpu.c. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the declaration of the `pcpu_fc_names` array in `include/linux/percpu.h` and `mm/percpu.c`. It changes the declaration from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];`. This change makes the array read-only and prevents accidental modification.

2. In `mm/percpu.c`, the patch updates the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst`. This change makes the array read-only and marks it as initialized during the initialization phase.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix that improves code readability and maintainability by making the `pcpu_fc_names` array read-only and properly initialized.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing the reliance on the 'driver' argument in the pxa27x_udc_stop() function. The patch replaces the 'driver' argument with NULL when calling the stop_activity() function.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. However, without additional context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.

If this patch is fixing a bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, then it may be suitable for inclusion in a stable release. However, without more information, it is not possible to make a final determination.

Please provide more details about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch so that I can provide a more accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the b43 N-PHY driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements reading support for radio 0x2057 and handles the different register values based on the device's PHY revision.

The patch includes a check for the PHY revision, and if it is greater than or equal to 7, it sets the register value to include the bit 0x200. Otherwise, it sets the register value to include the bit 0x100.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to reading support for a radio and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the format specifier used for printing a DMA address in the `dump_dtd` function of the `ti-vpe` driver. The warning suggests that the format specifier `%x` is used for an argument of type `dma_addr_t`, which is incorrect.

The patch replaces the `%x` format specifier with `%pad`, which is the correct format specifier for printing a `dma_addr_t` type. This change ensures that the correct value is printed without any warning.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a trivial fix related to printing format correctness. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - enable Tx power based on BT status." It suggests fixing an issue related to the usage of the firmware notification's bt_status instead of the bt_activity_grading for enabling Tx power in the BT Coex module.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies two sections of code in the bt-coex.c file.

   a. Line 648: The condition for canceling reduced Tx power is changed from checking bt_activity_grading to checking bt_status. This change implies that reduced Tx power will only be canceled if bt_status is false (indicating BT is off).

   b. Line 868: The condition for disabling reports is changed from checking bt_activity_grading to checking bt_status. This change implies that reports will only be disabled if bt_status is false (indicating BT is off).

3. Analysis: The patch aims to fix an issue related to the usage of the bt_activity_grading field in the firmware notification. It replaces the usage of bt_activity_grading with bt_status in two places. The intention is to enable Tx power and disable reports based on the BT status indicated by the firmware notification.

   The patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific behavior related to BT Coex functionality.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases). While it may improve the behavior of the BT Coex module, it does not fix a critical bug or address a real and critical issue as required for inclusion in -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a build issue in the brcmfmac driver when the CONFIG_BRCMDBG configuration option is not set. The build issue is caused by the undeclared BRCMF_FWS_TYPE_SEQ_LEN define, which was introduced in a previous commit but placed under an #ifdef DEBUG condition.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix related to build configuration.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return type of the `host_int_set_mac_chnl_num` function from `s32` to `int`. The reason for this change is that the `wilc_mq_send` function, which is called within `host_int_set_mac_chnl_num`, returns an `int` value.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the netfilter xt_hashlimit module. The patch introduces a "_ALL" macro and uses it to validate if the set bits are within a valid range. This change ensures that unknown flag bits are rejected.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code improvement to enhance validation.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `addrconf_rs_timer` function in the `net/ipv6/addrconf.c` file.

2. The patch adds a new variable `dev` of type `struct net_device *` and assigns it the value of `idev->dev`.

3. The patch releases the write lock on `idev->lock` using `write_unlock(&idev->lock)`.

4. The patch calls `ipv6_get_lladdr` to retrieve the link-local address (`lladdr`) for the device `dev` with the `IFA_F_TENTATIVE` flag.

5. If `ipv6_get_lladdr` succeeds in retrieving the link-local address, the patch jumps to the `put` label, which releases the reference to `idev` using `in6_dev_put(idev)`.

6. If `ipv6_get_lladdr` fails to retrieve the link-local address, the patch calls `ndisc_send_rs` to send a router solicitation message using the retrieved `lladdr` and the `in6addr_linklocal_allrouters` address.

7. After sending the router solicitation message, the patch reacquires the write lock on `idev->lock` using `write_lock(&idev->lock)`.

8. The patch updates the router solicitation timer based on the number of probes sent.

9. Finally, the patch releases the write lock on `idev->lock` using `write_unlock(&idev->lock)` and releases the reference to `idev` using `in6_dev_put(idev)`.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential deadlock issue caused by holding the write lock while calling `ndisc_send_rs`. It releases the write lock before calling `ndisc_send_rs` and reacquires it afterward. The patch also includes necessary locking changes to ensure correctness.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential deadlock issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the function `drbd_may_finish_epoch()` in the `drbd_receiver.c` file. It changes the function signature from `drbd_may_finish_epoch(struct drbd_conf *, struct drbd_epoch *, enum epoch_event)` to `drbd_may_finish_epoch(struct drbd_tconn *, struct drbd_epoch *, enum epoch_event)`. 

The patch also updates the function calls to `drbd_may_finish_epoch()` in the `receive_Barrier()` and `e_end_block()` functions, replacing the `mdev` parameter with `tconn`. Additionally, the function call in the `receive_Data()` function is updated to pass `tconn` instead of `mdev`.

Based on the provided patch, it seems that the change is only a function signature update and parameter replacement. There are no indications of any real and critical bug fixes, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues being addressed. Additionally, the changes do not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new macro called DUMMY_DATA, which is assigned the value 0x00. This macro is used to replace a hardcoded value in the code, making it more obvious that the value is dummy data.

2. The patch modifies two functions, rspi_receive_pio and qspi_receive_pio, by replacing the hardcoded value 0x00 with the DUMMY_DATA macro when performing a dummy write for generating clock.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a trivial fix that improves code readability by using a macro instead of a hardcoded value.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces a new constant `PT_MAX_HUGEPAGE_LEVEL` in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h` and modifies several functions in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c`. 

The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a code refactoring or optimization rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a processor identifier for the M5150 processor in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial addition to the codebase.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the xgene GPIO driver. The patch modifies the driver to use the gpiochip data pointer instead of relying on container_of() to access the state container. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

Since the patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue in the driver, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the display of the "tx_priority_pauseframes" statistic in the ethtool stats for the be2net driver. This change does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a minor enhancement to the ethtool functionality.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces calls to the function `cfs_trace_free_string_buffer()` with `kfree()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `uart_usp_ff_empty_mask` function in the `sirfsoc_uart.h` file.

2. The change is a correction to the calculation of the `empty_bit` variable.

3. Previously, the `empty_bit` was calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the `fifosize` variable.

4. The patch modifies the calculation by adding 1 to the result of the logarithm calculation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that corrects a calculation in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes undesired spaces, lines, and tabs. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential ordering issue in the ECAM kernel implementation when using ioremap() to map the ECAM configuration space memory region. The patch suggests updating the ioremap() interface to use pci_remap_cfgspace() instead, which guarantees that non-posted write transactions are issued for memory writes within the ECAM memory mapped address region.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical issue related to potential ordering problems in the PCIe fabric. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves message output by replacing the use of printk with pr_* functions. This change aligns with the kernel's preferred logging mechanism and improves code consistency.

2. The patch introduces a new function, dump_data_ecc, which prints a hexdump of error data and correct data. This can be helpful for debugging and understanding the state of the data during the test.

3. The patch changes the log level for the hexdump of data from KERN_DEBUG to KERN_INFO. This change ensures that the hexdump is visible in the system logs, providing more information to aid in debugging.

4. The patch factors out the hexdump code into a separate function, improving code modularity and readability.

Overall, the changes in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they enhance the message output and provide additional debugging information. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization for the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism to improve the average lookup time for memslots.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving performance. However, it is important to note that this patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It is a performance optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds a return value to the function `kvmppc_core_check_requests` in multiple files. However, it does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for vendor commands and events in the mac80211_hwsim driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds functionality for testing vendor commands and events.

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not fixing a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the platform data structure static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is aimed at improving the memory layout of the `struct sctp_transport` in the Linux kernel. The patch moves the `dst_cookie` field to fill a hole in the cacheline, which can potentially improve cache utilization and performance.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or code refactoring change rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue introduced by commit a4b6a77b77ba4f526392612c2365797fab956014, which broke the MODVERSIONS loading of any module using memcmp on x86_32. The patch replaces VMLINUX_SYMBOL_STR with __VMLINUX_SYMBOL_STR to prevent unwanted expansion of the argument.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to module loading and symbol versioning.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check for the "i915_fastboot" parameter before updating the pipe size and adjusting the fitter.
   - This indicates that the patch is introducing a conditional behavior based on the "i915_fastboot" parameter.

2. If "i915_fastboot" is true, the patch updates the pipe size and adjusts the fitter.
   - This suggests that the patch is modifying the behavior of the driver during fast boot scenarios.

3. If the current pipe's pfit size is zero and the pipe type is either INTEL_OUTPUT_LVDS or INTEL_OUTPUT_EDP, the patch resets the PF_CTL, PF_WIN_POS, and PF_WIN_SZ registers.
   - This indicates that the patch is resetting the panel fitting settings for specific pipe types during fast boot.

4. Finally, the patch calls the "update_plane" function to update the plane with the provided parameters.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a specific behavior for fast boot scenarios in the Intel i915 graphics driver. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be specific to a particular use case rather than addressing a general issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing reset status information to the GFX hardware module in the OMAP2+ AM33xx platform. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only removes the __initdata attribute from the "keypad_pads" structure declaration.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would classify it as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a delivery system type at the fe struct. This change does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address any real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a bug related to the iommu_map() function in the iommu.c file. The patch corrects the second argument of the trace_map() function to report the correct physical address (paddr) by introducing a new variable "orig_paddr" in the iommu_map() function.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria for acceptance. The patch does not explicitly mention any specific bug or issue it addresses, so we need to analyze the code changes to determine its impact.

The patch seems to fix a potential issue where the trace_map() function was using the wrong physical address (paddr) due to the addition of pgsize value in the iommu_map() code. By introducing the "orig_paddr" variable and using it in the trace_map() function, the correct physical address is reported.

Based on the provided information, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to reporting the correct physical address in the trace_map() function.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical bug or issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `container_of()` with `rb_entry()` in the `qib_user_sdma_rb_search()` and `qib_user_sdma_rb_insert()` functions in the `qib_user_sdma.c` file of the RDMA/qib driver. 

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a code improvement for clarity and maintainability.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the header version correctly in the perf data file. The patch sets the header version to PERF_HEADER_VERSION_2 in the check_magic_endian() function.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause confusion and incorrect identification of perf.data files, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `container_of` with `rb_entry` in the `swsusp_extents_insert` function. This change is semantically more appropriate for iterating through the rbtree.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems that the change is not fixing a real and critical bug or addressing any significant issue. The patch only updates the workqueue creation interface, but there is no change in functionality. Additionally, the patch mentions that the ordering is not a concern, but it does highlight a dependency on running at most one work item at a time.

Since this patch does not fix any critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem, and it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary parentheses. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve debugging for critical host errors in the xHCI (USB 3.0) host controller driver. It adds additional error handling code to print out the contents of the Transfer Request Block (TRB) and the event ring when certain errors occur.

The patch addresses two specific error scenarios: when a transfer event points to a bad slot and when a transfer event is for a disabled endpoint or an incorrect stream ring. In both cases, the patch prints out the relevant information for debugging purposes.

This patch meets the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases as it addresses real and critical bugs that can cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. It provides valuable information for users to understand what went wrong without requiring them to recompile the kernel.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing a pointless cast in the sha1_mb_mod_init() function in arch/x86/crypto/sha-mb/sha1_mb.c. The patch removes the unnecessary cast when allocating memory using kzalloc().

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a second parent option for the dbg_base_clk in the socfpga clock driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

In this case, the patch does not seem to address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It appears to be adding an additional parent option for the debug base clock. This change does not seem to fall under the criteria of a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the driver probe routine in the rtl8192e driver. The patch audits the return value of the register_netdev() function and returns -ENODEV in case of an error. This ensures that if there is an error during the registration of the network device, the driver probe routine will handle it appropriately.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a failure in registering the network device, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be introducing two helper functions for accessing the ITS BASERn register in the irq-gic-v3-its.c file. These functions, its_read_baser() and its_write_baser(), are used to read and write the BASERn register respectively.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds convenience functions for accessing a register.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel crash caused by a bogus dereference when the app_id is zero. This can be considered a critical bug that could lead to system instability or crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward export of two functions, bdi_alloc_node() and bdi_put(), which are used by MTD (Memory Technology Devices) and need to be called directly. The patch also includes the necessary EXPORT_SYMBOL statements for these functions.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that initializes the `q->bufs[vb->index]` variable correctly before calling `buf_init()`. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to resource release in the `mg_get_local_EKB` and `mg_get_ICV` functions in the `ms.c` file of the `rts5208` staging driver. The patch adds a jump to the appropriate label to ensure that resources are properly released before returning.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to resource leaks, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes trailing commas in enum declarations. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the interrupt sources in the ARM mx53 platform. The patch updates the interrupt names from "RESV" to more meaningful names like "DAP", "RTC", "PTP", "MLB", "ASRC", etc. 

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it addresses a specific issue related to interrupt sources, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only updates the version number in the dm-ioctl.h header file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug reported by Smatch, which complains about the cast to "int" in the min_t() macro potentially causing incorrect values to be returned. The patch removes the const and changes the type to "uint" to fix this issue.

The change in the min_t() macro ensures that the current_read_size value does not become negative when read_size - total_read is a very large value. This prevents min_t() from returning the wrong value.

Additionally, the patch includes a check for the capabilities of the SMB server. If the server does not support large files, the current_read_size is further limited to CIFSMaxBufSize.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect values being returned and ensures compatibility with SMB servers that do not support large files. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds loopback mode support to the spi-imx driver. Loopback mode can be activated by setting the LBC (LoopBack Control) bit of the ECSPI_TESTREG register.

2. The patch defines the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG and MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC constants to represent the register address and the bit for loopback control, respectively.

3. In the mx51_ecspi_config() function, the patch reads the current value of the ECSPI_TESTREG register using the readl() function.

4. If the SPI_LOOP flag is set in the config->mode field, the patch sets the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC bit in the register value. Otherwise, it clears the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC bit.

5. The modified register value is then written back to the ECSPI_TESTREG register using the writel() function.

6. Finally, in the spi_imx_probe() function, the SPI_LOOP flag is added to the mode_bits field of the spi_imx->bitbang.master structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds support for loopback mode in the spi-imx driver. Loopback mode can be useful for testing and debugging purposes. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be a trivial fix that involves replacing some functions with common extra gpio methods. The patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it contains comments indicating that the functions should be replaced by correct gpio functions in the future.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and consolidation rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the multi-device fixup code from the `denali_init()` function to a new helper function called `denali_multidev_fixup()`. 

While this patch improves code organization and readability, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, it does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming some macros and removing unused code. The changes do not fix any real and critical bugs, nor do they address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that adds a parameter to the 'dbg_check_name()' debugging function and marks the parameters as 'const'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the "target_send_reply_msg" function static.

Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the openvswitch module in the Linux kernel. The patch introduces the use of the flow hash during the flow lookup operation, which can help detect hash collisions and avoid unnecessary flow key comparisons.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug by improving the flow lookup operation, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style issue related to a line length exceeding 80 characters. This type of fix does not address a real and critical bug, nor does it fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving a print statement inside the `identity_mapping_add()` function. The print statement itself does not seem to address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an informational message.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing incorrect Probe Response offload support for Interworking in the ath6kl driver. The patch removes the capability flag NL80211_PROBE_RESP_OFFLOAD_SUPPORT_80211U, which indicates that ath6kl does not support Probe Response offloading for Interworking.

Since this patch removes incorrect functionality and does not introduce any new issues, it can be considered a valid fix for a bug. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug being fixed. If the bug is critical and meets the criteria of causing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other significant issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, the decision whether to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) depends on the severity and impact of the bug being fixed.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new capability to the microblaze architecture for the system timer selection. This is a functional enhancement rather than a trivial fix.

2. The patch introduces a new property called "system-timer" in the chosen node of the device tree. This property allows the DTS (Device Tree Source) author to specify a particular timer as the system timer.

3. If the "system-timer" property is present in the chosen node, the patch retrieves the handle of the timer node specified by the property and uses it as the system timer.

4. If the "system-timer" property is not present, the patch falls back to the current behavior of using the first found timer as the system timer.

5. If no timer node is found based on the "system-timer" property or the fallback, a warning message is printed to indicate that no chosen timer was found, and the default behavior is used.

6. The patch ensures that the timer node is found and sets the timer_baseaddr variable accordingly.

Based on the above analysis, the patch introduces a new capability and improves the flexibility of selecting the system timer in the microblaze architecture. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve the clarity of the interrupt handling code in the iwlwifi PCIe driver.

2. The patch replaces the existing hierarchy of functions (iwl_pcie_irq_handler -> iwl_pcie_isr_ict -> iwl_pcie_isr_non_ict) with a simpler if-else statement in the iwl_pcie_irq_handler function.

3. The if-else statement checks the value of the "use_ict" variable and calls either iwl_pcie_int_cause_ict or iwl_pcie_int_cause_non_ict accordingly.

4. The iwl_pcie_int_cause_non_ict function handles the legacy (non-ICT) interrupt case.

5. The iwl_pcie_int_cause_ict function handles the ICT (Interrupt Cause Table) interrupt case.

6. The iwl_pcie_irq_handle_error function is not modified by this patch.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it improves code clarity and simplifies the interrupt handling logic.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Additionally, I would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and its impact so that I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a printk statement with pr_err. The change is aimed at addressing a checkpatch.pl warning related to the preferred usage of pr_err over printk(KERN_ERR).

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock in the GFS2 file system.

2. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_data`, the patch adds a check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the patch sets the `TR_TOUCHED` flag and skips taking the `gfs2_log_lock`. This change helps avoid unnecessary contention on the `gfs2_log_lock`.

3. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_meta`, the patch adds a similar check for the `buffer_head`. If it is already in a transaction, the `TR_TOUCHED` flag is set, and the `gfs2_log_lock` is skipped. This change also reduces contention on the `gfs2_log_lock`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue of contention on the `gfs2_log_lock` and introduces optimizations to avoid unnecessary locking. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the ipr driver in the SCSI subsystem. The patch increases the dump size in the ipr driver to 80MB to aid in debugging new SAS controllers.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding DMA resume capabilities for the Skylake platform in the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) subsystem. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that it uses DMA resume capability to resume the DMA position when a stream is suspended/resumed. This indicates that it addresses a potential issue related to resuming audio streams.

2. The patch adds code to enable DMA Resume enable bit for the stream and sets the dpib and lpib positions to resume before starting the DMA. This suggests that it aims to ensure proper resumption of audio streams by setting the correct DMA positions.

3. The patch also saves the dpib and lpib positions when the stream is suspended, which allows for proper restoration of these positions when the stream is resumed.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to resuming audio streams on the Skylake platform. It introduces necessary changes to enable DMA resume and properly restore DMA positions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the default value for available voltages in the mxcmmc driver. The patch ensures that if available voltages are not given, the driver sets a default value for the ocr_avail mask.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a non-critical issue related to default values.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies a NULL comparison. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding SERDES initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 in the ath9k driver. The patch includes changes to the ar9003_hw_init_mode_regs function in ar9003_hw.c and adds a new array in ar9462_2p1_initvals.h for the PCIe SERDES initialization.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. From the patch description and code changes, it is not explicitly mentioned that this patch fixes a bug, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue. Additionally, the changes seem to be related to adding initialization values for a specific hardware version.

Without further context or information about the bug or issue this patch is intended to address, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. However, based on the provided information, it seems more likely that this patch is adding new functionality or improving hardware support rather than fixing a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless additional information is provided to demonstrate its criticality or significance in addressing a real and critical bug or issue.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the i40e_acquire_nvm() function in the i40e_nvm.c file of the i40e driver. It introduces changes related to acquiring the NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) semaphore.

The patch adds additional debug information to the debug messages. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of the NVM acquisition process.

The main change introduced by the patch is the addition of a condition to only poll on the NVM semaphore if there is time left on a previous reservation. This change aims to optimize the NVM acquisition process by avoiding unnecessary polling when there is no time left.

Additionally, the patch includes some minor changes to the debug messages, providing more detailed information about the NVM acquisition status and any associated errors.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses an optimization issue in the NVM acquisition process and improves the debug information. However, it does not fix any critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug fixed by this patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues. However, it can lead to incorrect behavior or functionality problems, which can indirectly impact system stability and performance.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to the data type of the "fw_func_mode" field.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can impact system behavior and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to watchdog ping return errors being ignored by the watchdog core. The patch propagates the ping error code to the user space, ensuring that the watchdog daemon is informed about possible hardware errors or if the underlying device driver gets unregistered.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue that could potentially lead to hardware errors or driver unregistration. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to setting the number of queues correctly in the NVMe driver. The patch modifies the `nvme_get_features` function to instead call `nvme_set_features` when setting the number of queues.

The change seems to address a potential bug where the number of queues is incorrectly set using the `nvme_get_features` function instead of the appropriate `nvme_set_features` function. This could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the NVMe driver.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior or instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks certain functions as static in the `tfc_conf.c` file. The patch does not fix any real or critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only eliminates warnings related to missing prototypes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds two clocks for the mxc rtc driver on imx35, which seems to be a straightforward addition without fixing any specific issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the mv88e6xxx_set_port_state function in the dsa/mv88e6xxx.c file. The patch ensures that the correct error code is returned if the _mv88e6xxx_reg_read function returns an error.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves cleaning up the usage of the `hcpriv` field in the `octeon-usb` staging driver. The changes involve using `ep->hcpriv` for the pipe handle and `urb->hcpriv` for the submit handle, instead of packing both into the same field.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the AMD IOMMU driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the function `dma_ops_free_addresses` in the `amd_iommu.c` file.

2. The change replaces the setting of `dom->need_flush` with a direct flush of the IOMMU TLB in `dma_ops_free_addresses`.

3. The condition `if (address + pages > range->next_bit)` checks if the address plus the number of pages exceeds the next bit in the range.

4. If the condition is true, the `domain_flush_tlb` and `domain_flush_complete` functions are called to flush the TLB.

5. Finally, the `address` variable is updated.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to flushing the IOMMU TLB in the AMD IOMMU driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves changing the behavior of the code to directly flush the TLB instead of setting a flag.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to data corruption (flushing the TLB), it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria for inclusion.

The patch is titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker support for Asus AiO ZN270IE" and is signed off by multiple contributors. It addresses an issue where the Asus AiO ZN270IE with ALC256 has no audio output for internal speaker and headphone. The patch enables GPIO 2 as an amp and pulls it high.

Looking at the code changes, the patch adds a new fixup entry, `ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2`, to the `alc269_fixups` array in `patch_realtek.c`. This fixup sets up GPIO2 for the speaker amp by sending specific AC_VERB commands.

Additionally, the patch adds a new entry to the `alc269_fixup_tbl` array in the same file, associating the PCI device ID `0x1043:0x3030` with the `ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2` fixup.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific hardware issue related to audio output on the Asus AiO ZN270IE. It introduces a necessary fix to enable the GPIO and resolve the problem.

Considering that the issue affects a specific hardware model and the patch provides a targeted fix, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves code refactoring and consolidation. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of sscanf with kstrtoint. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the guidelines, such patches should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing call to `platform_set_drvdata` in the `da9052_bat_probe` function. This fix ensures that the driver data is properly set for the platform device, preventing a potential issue where `platform_get_drvdata` would return NULL in the `da9052_bat_remove` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a log message if DP link training fails in the Nouveau display driver.

2. The change is made in the `nouveau_dp_train` function in the `dport.c` file.

3. The patch modifies the while loop condition from `while (link_bw[0])` to `while ((ret = -EIO) && link_bw[0])`. This change introduces a new variable `ret` and assigns the value `-EIO` to it. The loop will continue as long as `link_bw[0]` is not zero and `ret` is equal to `-EIO`.

4. After the loop, if `ret` is less than zero, it logs an error message stating that link training failed.

5. The patch then executes the post-train script from the vbios.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue with DP link training in the Nouveau display driver and adds a log message to indicate if the training fails. This can help in diagnosing and troubleshooting display-related issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that checks the return value of the `nla_put_be32` function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MC13783 RTC functionality on the MX31PDK board. This can be considered a real and critical bug fix as it enables the proper functioning of the RTC feature on the board.

Since the patch addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for the topology file of ABI v4. This indicates that it addresses a specific issue related to the topology ABI versioning.

2. The patch ensures backward compatibility by allowing the kernel to continue parsing the topology file generated by ABI v4, even if the kernel is using a newer ABI version.

3. The patch introduces a new constant, SND_SOC_TPLG_ABI_VERSION_MIN, which specifies the oldest version of the ABI supported. This ensures that the kernel can handle topology files generated by older ABI versions.

4. The patch includes appropriate error handling by checking the ABI version in the soc_valid_header() function. If the ABI version is not within the supported range, an error message is logged.

Based on these points, the patch appears to address a real and critical issue related to the topology ABI versioning. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a request for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) capabilities during target initialization in the ath6kl driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption. It also does not address any real security issue explicitly.
2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
3. The added code requests P2P capabilities using the ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd function. This suggests that it may be addressing a potential issue related to P2P functionality.
4. The patch does not provide any additional context or explanation for why this change is necessary.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a critical bug or an "oh, that's not good" issue. Without more context or explanation, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further information is provided to demonstrate its criticality and necessity.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "drm/i915/gvt: Mark i915.enable_gvt as false if loading fails." It suggests updating the value of i915.enable_gvt to false if loading the GVT (Graphics Virtualization Technology) fails. This change allows userspace to easily detect when the loading of GVT fails as requested.

The patch includes a testcase (igt/gvt_basic) and is signed-off by Chris Wilson. It is also reviewed by Zhi Wang. The patch can be found at the provided link.

In the code changes, the existing return statements in the intel_gvt_init function are replaced with a "goto bail" statement. This change ensures that if the loading of GVT fails at any point, the code will jump to the "bail" label, where i915.enable_gvt is set to 0 (false). This ensures that the value is updated correctly when loading fails.

Overall, this patch addresses a critical issue by properly handling the failure to load GVT and updating the relevant variable. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue where regulatory events are processed before the wiphy is registered, leading to a potential problem when calling regulatory_hint() at an early stage.

2. The patch adds a new variable "wiphy_registered" to the "struct ath6kl" in the core.h file. This variable will track the registration status of the wiphy.

3. In the ath6kl_cfg80211_init() function in cfg80211.c, the patch sets "ar->wiphy_registered" to true after the wiphy is registered.

4. In the ath6kl_cfg80211_cleanup() function in cfg80211.c, the patch unregisters the wiphy and sets "ar->wiphy_registered" to false.

5. In the ath6kl_wmi_regdomain_event() function in wmi.c, the patch adds a check for "wmi->parent_dev->wiphy_registered" before processing the regulatory event.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a potential issue related to regulatory events being processed before wiphy registration. It ensures that the wiphy is registered before calling regulatory_hint(). Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds support for the `vidioc_create_bufs` operation in the `bfin_capture` driver in the `media` subsystem. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, let's check if it fixes a real and critical bug. The patch description does not mention any bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding a new feature or functionality rather than fixing a bug.

Next, we need to assess if it causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. The patch does not indicate any such issues.

Lastly, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Since the patch only adds support for a new operation, it does not seem to include any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the saa7134 driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to make the saa7134 driver more V4L2 compliant by filtering audio modes that come from the tuner, keeping only MONO/STEREO in radio mode.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the "radio_g_tuner" function in the "saa7134-video.c" file. Specifically, it adds a line of code that filters the audio mode by applying a bitwise AND operation with the values of V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO and V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO to the "audmode" variable.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to audio modes in the saa7134 driver. While it may not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption, it does improve V4L2 compliance and can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization order of the hardware (HW) so that the interrupt is only requested after the HW is initialized. This can help prevent potential issues that may arise from requesting the interrupt before the HW is fully initialized. This change seems reasonable and can potentially fix bugs related to interrupt handling.

2. The patch replaces the use of `irq_of_parse_and_map` with `platform_get_irq`. This change is likely done to improve code consistency and maintainability. It does not directly fix any critical bugs but can be considered a code improvement.

3. The patch includes a call to `bcm2835aux_spi_reset_hw` to reset the SPI-HW block. This reset can help ensure the HW is in a known state before further operations. This change can potentially fix bugs related to the SPI-HW block.

4. The patch requests the interrupt using `devm_request_irq`. This is necessary for proper interrupt handling and can help prevent issues related to interrupt registration.

5. Finally, the patch registers the SPI master using `devm_spi_register_master`. This step is essential for proper SPI functionality.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It includes some code improvements and changes the initialization order, but these changes do not address any critical issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization and cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch converts the usage of `wait_for(I915_READ(reg))` to `intel_wait_for_register()` in the `assert_chv_phy_status()` function.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it is not fixing any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be exporting the `tegra_chip_id` variable in the ARM Tegra platform code. This change allows the powergating and reset handling code to differentiate between different Tegra variants.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a trivial change that exports a variable.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that the clock rates were previously set after the initialization of the timer, resulting in the timer using the incorrect clock rate for the board.
2. The patch fixes this issue by moving the clock rate setting before the timer initialization.
3. The patch is signed-off by Hideki EIRAKU and Acked-by Kuninori Morimoto.
4. The patch is also signed-off by Simon Horman, who is the maintainer of the arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-armadillo800eva.c file where the changes are made.
5. The patch moves the eva_clock_init() function call from the eva_init() function to the eva_earlytimer_init() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to clock rates and ensures that the correct clock rate is used for the board. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves moving a function call to a different location. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a recommended alternative. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo and renames a function. The changes do not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a candidate for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch deletes the 'rtl819xU_cmd_isr' function that is not used anywhere in the driver. This indicates that the function is unnecessary and removing it can help improve code cleanliness and maintainability.

2. The patch also fixes a sparse warning in the 'r8192U_core.c' file. The warning suggests that the 'rtl819xU_cmd_isr' symbol was not declared and asks if it should be static. By deleting the function, this warning is resolved.

3. The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on removing unused code and fixing a warning.

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. It removes unnecessary code and resolves a warning, which can contribute to better code quality and maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving a structure definition from one header file to another. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that encapsulates the boot vector code into a function for cpuidle. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new member to the `struct intel_gmbus` in the `i915_drv.h` header file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `cx24123_pll_writereg()`. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a timeout for ramrod replies in the cnic driver for the bnx2x device.
2. The timeout is implemented using the wait_event_timeout() function, which allows the driver to make forward progress and reset the chip if it encounters parity errors.
3. The patch modifies the cnic_bnx2x_destroy_ramrod() function to use wait_event_timeout() instead of wait_event().
4. The patch also modifies the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function to use wait_event_timeout() instead of wait_event().
5. In the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function, the patch sets the completion status of kcqe to FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR if the wait condition is not met within the timeout.
6. The patch sets the CNIC_RAMROD_TMO constant to HZ / 4 in cnic.h.
7. The patch adds the FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR constant to cnic_defs.h.

Based on the analysis, this patch introduces a timeout mechanism for handling ramrod replies in the cnic driver. It addresses a potential issue related to parity errors and allows the driver to reset the chip if necessary. The changes made in the patch are not trivial and are aimed at improving the stability and reliability of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The failure of devm_clk_get for the core clock was being ignored, and the core_clk was explicitly set to NULL. This could lead to potential issues if other remaining clocks are queried without the core clock being properly acquired.

2. The patch fixes the issue by returning failure when devm_clk_get fails for the core clock. This ensures that any failure in acquiring the core clock is properly handled and reported.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the actual bug.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple developers, as indicated by the Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by tags.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix the response behavior of UP requests in the drm/dp/mst module. Currently, NACK is being sent as a response, which may confuse receivers. The patch suggests changing the reply type to ACK, ensuring correct response behavior.

2. Patch Context: The patch author mentions that although no actual issues have been observed with the current behavior, it is still important to respond to UP requests correctly. This indicates that the patch addresses a potential issue that could cause confusion.

3. Code Changes: The code change is minimal and focused on modifying the reply type from 1 (NACK) to 0 (ACK). This change ensures that UP requests are responded to correctly.

4. Sign-offs and Review: The patch has been signed-off by Mykola Lysenko and reviewed by Alex Deucher, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and validation.

5. Link to Patch: The patch includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website, providing additional context and discussion around the patch.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The current code returns -1 when kzalloc fails, which is not the correct error code for an out-of-memory condition. The patch changes the return value to -ENOMEM, which accurately reflects the failure reason.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: If kzalloc fails to allocate memory, the subsequent call to hpsa_scsi_do_inquiry may attempt to access the uninitialized buffer, leading to potential data corruption.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a significant issue and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has proper sign-offs and acknowledgments: The patch includes the necessary sign-offs from the author and reviewers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and prevent potential data corruption.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" on the s390 architecture.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds additional information to the /proc/cpuinfo file.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of adding new features or enhancements rather than addressing critical issues. As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a clock for the FSI (Full Serial Interface) to the sh73a0 ARM-based shmobile platform. The patch includes modifications to the clock-sh73a0.c file, specifically adding the FSI clock definition and its associated lookup.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   No, the patch does not mention fixing a bug. It seems to be adding support for the FSI clock.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   No, the patch does not introduce any issues that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

3. Does the patch address a real security issue?
   No, the patch does not mention any security-related fixes.

4. Does the patch fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not address any problematic issues.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its changes and check if it meets the criteria.

The patch modifies the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup function in the lpfc_init.c file. It adds a loop to configure the EQ (interrupt) delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function. The lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function is also modified to accept a uint32_t parameter instead of a uint16_t parameter.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it is not mentioned if the changes contain any trivial fixes.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. More context or details about the bug being fixed and the impact of the changes would be necessary to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification before deciding whether to accept or reject this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a helper function addition in the tcp_input.c file. The purpose of this helper function is to prepare for the main RACK patch. 

The patch itself does not fix any specific bug or address any critical issue. It seems to be a preparatory change for a future patch. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capabilities and structures for SR-IOV E-Switch in the mlx5 driver. However, the patch does not address any specific bug or issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing any significant issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix timeout issues in the QAT (QuickAssist Technology) driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch changes the data type of the variable "times" from "unsigned int" to "int" in three places: lines 389, 453, and 658. This change is necessary because the value of "times" should be -1 after the loop. This change seems reasonable and does not appear to be a trivial fix.

2. On line 402, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change ensures that the loop exits when "times" becomes negative. It seems like a valid fix for the timeout issue.

3. Similarly, on line 467, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change also seems appropriate for handling the timeout issue.

4. On line 658, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change appears to be consistent with the previous changes and should address the timeout issue.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to timeout issues in the QAT driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a spelling mistake in the greth.c file. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that added a "drv_priv" pointer for driver use in the mac80211 module. The reason for the revert is that no driver has been found to need this functionality, and the desired functionality has been implemented in a different way.

Since this patch is a revert and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bug, it can be considered a trivial change. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the "const" keyword from two SOC_ENUM_SINGLE_DECL declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   - It includes a check for an error condition in bcm2835_dma_create_cb_chain, which improves error handling.
   - The patch has been tested using dmatest for all enabled channels, indicating some level of verification.
   - It adds a new function bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy for preparing a DMA memcpy operation, which enhances the functionality of the driver.
   - The dma_cap_set is updated to include DMA_MEMCPY capability, indicating that the driver now supports DMA memcpy operations.
   - The od->ddev.device_prep_dma_memcpy function pointer is updated to bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy, ensuring the new function is used for DMA memcpy operations.
   - od->ddev.directions is updated to include BIT(DMA_MEM_TO_MEM), indicating that the driver now supports DMA memcpy operations.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch adds a new feature to the bcm2835-dma driver, which is the support for dma_memcopy. It includes error handling improvements, has been tested, and enhances the functionality of the driver. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough analysis may be required to consider other factors such as the impact on existing functionality, compatibility with different hardware configurations, and potential regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to a potentially uninitialized variable in the bcm2835_clock_choose_div_and_prate() function in the bcm2835 clock driver. 

Since this patch addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new event buffer cache in the DWC3 USB core driver. The purpose of this cache is to copy triggered events from the event buffer and process them later in the bottom half handler. The patch also includes the necessary memory allocation and initialization for the cache.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue. The patch description mentions that it is implementing a workaround for a known erratum in recent DWC3 releases. However, the patch itself does not provide any specific details about the erratum or the impact it has on the system.

Without more information about the nature and severity of the erratum, it is difficult to assess the criticality of the bug being fixed. Additionally, the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues explicitly.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the current understanding, it seems more likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further details about the erratum and its impact are provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time. This can be considered as an enhancement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch adds AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. AFTR mode support has already been implemented for other Exynos SoCs.

The differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC compared to Exynos4x12 SoCs are:
- Different secure firmware calls are used.
- Different wakeup masks (S5P_WAKEUP_MASK and S5P_WAKEUP_MASK2) need to be set.
- The C2_STATE BOOT mode flag needs to be set/cleared pre/post AFTR.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the patch addresses specific differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC. It includes changes to the firmware.c, pm.c, regs-pmu.h, and smc.h files.

Considering that the patch adds support for a specific SoC and addresses differences in AFTR mode support, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to power management. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error in the `arch/mips/ath79/mach-ap136.c` file. The error is caused by passing too many arguments to the `ap136_pci_init` function. The patch adds the missing argument `u8 *eeprom` to the function declaration.

Since this patch fixes a build error, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the fix is trivial as it only adds a missing function argument. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to `pwm_apply_args()` after requesting the PWM device. The comment in the code suggests that this is an intermediate state and that `pwm_apply_args()` should be removed once the atomic PWM infrastructure is in place and the driver makes use of it.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a trivial fix that can be considered a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup," it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the FSI DMAEngine in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the DMA is properly terminated at the start/stop time, which prevents noise on playback. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause audio playback issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to reclaim reboot state when the clientid is stale in NFSv4.0. It modifies the `nfs4_handle_reclaim_lease_error` function to clear the `NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM` bit and start the reclaim reboot process when encountering the `-NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID` error.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to stale clientids in NFSv4.0. It also introduces changes to handle the error condition appropriately by clearing the `NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM` bit and initiating the reclaim reboot process.

Considering that the patch fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function in the `ie6xx_wdt.c` file. The `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is currently annotated as `__devexit`, but it is called from `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` as part of its error cleanup path.

Looking at the patch, it seems that the `__devexit` annotation has been removed from both the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` functions. This change suggests that the functions are no longer intended to be used exclusively during device removal.

Without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. However, based solely on the provided information, it seems that this patch may not be critical enough to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `of_node_put` function call to decrement the reference count. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has gone through review and testing.

2. The patch modifies the `rapl_ids` array in the `intel_rapl.c` file. The change marks the array as `__initconst`, which means it will be released after initialization is done. This change ensures that the memory used by `rapl_ids` is freed after initialization, reducing memory usage.

3. The `rapl_ids` array is only used in the `rapl_init()` function, which is itself an `__init` function. This means that the array is only accessed during the initialization phase and is not used afterwards. Therefore, marking it as `__initconst` is safe and does not introduce any functional changes.

4. The change does not fall under the category of "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential memory usage issue, which can be considered a non-trivial fix.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the "pending" flag in the command structure. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `set_page_private` and `page_private` with `set_freepage_migratetype` and `get_freepage_migratetype` respectively. This change aims to make the code clearer.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a trivial code modification, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unused "debug" module parameter from the cypress_m8.c USB serial driver. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes a parameter that does not have any effect, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for better readability by using defined macros instead of hard-coding values. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing break statements in the `ath5k_hw_set_spur_mitigation_filter` function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code style cleanup in the rt2800lib.c file of the rt2x00 driver. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix, as it only involves code style changes.

According to the given criteria, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a pointless copy operation in the nfsd4_exchange_id function in the nfs4state.c file. The copy_verf function is being called with the 'conf' and 'verf' parameters, but the result is not being used anywhere in the code.

Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused variables and corresponding lines of code. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of "trivial" fixes (removing unused variables), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function and replaces per_cpu_ptr() with this_cpu_ptr(). 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the logging mechanism for link up/down messages in the ixgbevf driver. The patch replaces the use of `hw_dbg` with `dev_info` to log the messages.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch mainly converts the mx51_clocks_init() function to a device tree (DT) call and removes the mx51_clocks_init_dt() function, which is no longer needed.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves code refactoring, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devinitdata. This suggests that it is a cleanup change rather than fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch simply replaces the call to `platform_get_drvdata(pdev)` with the already available `dw` variable. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding clock definitions for the SYS-DMAC modules on the Renesas R8A7796 platform. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce two new functions: `vm_entry_controls_reset_shadow` and `vm_exit_controls_reset_shadow`. These functions reset the shadow values of the entry and exit control fields in the VMCS.

The patch also modifies the `nested_vmx_vmexit` function to use the new reset shadow functions instead of directly initializing the entry and exit control values.

From the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or code cleanup rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch for the mac80211 module in the Linux kernel. The patch removes a duplicate declaration of the `ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work` function and moves it to the correct location within the header file.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only involves a trivial cleanup by removing a duplicate declaration, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable from "pvRecvBuffer" to "recv_buf" in the wilc_mq_recv function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only involves renaming a variable for better code readability.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for host-protection-interruption in the s390 architecture for KVM. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

In this case, the patch does not seem to fix a bug or address any critical issue. It appears to be adding a new feature or enhancement related to host-protection-interruption. 

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch mainly changes the key initialization of tcp_fastopen cookies to use net_get_random_once instead of get_random_bytes. While this change may have some benefits, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve replacing the assignment of `serial->private` with a direct assignment to `data`, and using the `usb_{get,set}_serial_data` functions to access the USB-serial data.

Since the patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only involves a trivial change, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode for the OMAP DMA engine. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch description states that the audio stack used omap_stop_dma/omap_start_dma to pause/resume the DMA, which has been used for years on OMAP based products. This suggests that the patch addresses an existing functionality used in production systems.

2. The patch modifies the "struct omap_chan" by adding a new boolean field called "paused" to track the pause/resume state of the DMA channel.

3. In the "omap_dma_terminate_all" function, the patch adds a check to avoid stopping the DMA twice if it has already been paused.

4. The "omap_dma_pause" function is added to handle the pause operation. It checks if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode and if it is not already paused. If these conditions are met, it stops the DMA and updates the "paused" flag.

5. The "omap_dma_resume" function is added to handle the resume operation. Similar to "omap_dma_pause", it checks if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode and if it is currently paused. If these conditions are met, it starts the DMA and updates the "paused" flag.

6. The "omap_dma_control" function is modified to handle the pause and resume commands. It calls the respective pause or resume functions based on the command received.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch adds a useful feature to the OMAP DMA engine by allowing pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and addresses a real issue related to DMA control. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `strcmp` with `strncmp` for string comparison. This change ensures that the comparison does not overflow the device name buffer and includes the necessary null terminator. This addresses a potential buffer overflow issue.

2. The patch also replaces the usage of `strncpy` with `sizeof` for copying the device name. By using `sizeof`, the patch ensures that the entire device name is copied, including the null terminator. This prevents any potential issues with truncated device names.

3. The patch includes the Acked-by and Signed-off-by tags from relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by them.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential buffer overflow issue and ensures correct copying of the device name. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - disable RRC by default". It suggests disabling the RRC (Radio Resource Control) feature by default in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices.

2. The patch checks if the firmware advertises support for the BT Coex RRC feature. If the firmware supports it, the feature will be enabled; otherwise, it will remain disabled.

3. The patch modifies the "enum iwl_ucode_tlv_capa" enumeration in the iwl-fw-file.h file to include a new capability flag, "IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_BT_COEX_RRC", indicating support for BT Coex RRC.

4. The patch updates the "iwl_send_bt_init_conf_old" function in the coex_legacy.c file to use the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function to check if BT Coex RRC is supported by the firmware. If supported, the BT_COEX_RRC flag will be set in the bt_cmd->flags field.

5. The patch adds the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function in the mvm.h file to check if BT Coex RRC is supported based on the firmware's capability flags.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a valid fix for enabling the BT Coex RRC feature only if the firmware supports it. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new capability flag and modifies the code to enable the feature conditionally.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, such as addressing a significant issue related to Bluetooth coexistence in the iwlwifi driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the blk-mq subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch correctly frees the hctx->ctx_map inside the blk_mq_free_queue() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding JPEG register definitions for the CODA7541 media platform driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds JPEG specific sequence initialization registers and bit definitions. This indicates that it is addressing a specific functionality related to JPEG processing in the CODA7541 driver.

2. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding new functionality or improving existing functionality.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It adds new register definitions and bit definitions, which can be considered non-trivial changes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the lnet_ping() function in the staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/api-ni.c file. The patch changes the type of the "ids" parameter from "lnet_process_id_t *" to "lnet_process_id_t __user *". 

The change in the patch is necessary to properly mark the userspace pointer of "lnet_ping()" and silence sparse warnings about different address spaces. This indicates that the patch addresses a potential issue related to userspace pointer handling.

Since the patch fixes a real bug and addresses a potential issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver. The patch adds two new event handlers, `wmi_evt_linkup` and `wmi_evt_linkdown`, which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively. These events are triggered by the firmware when the data path becomes ready or when the link is lost.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it appears to handle events related to the link status in the wil6210 driver.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the `ieee80211_ibss_join()` function in the `ibss.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch adds a missing `mutex_unlock()` call in the error path when `ieee80211_set_channel_type()` returns an error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue related to locking, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It seems to be a valid and necessary fix to ensure proper locking behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in a stable release. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to constify the `def_qos_parameters` structure in the `rtl8192u` driver's `r8192U_core.c` file.
2. The `def_qos_parameters` structure is only passed as the source parameter to the `memcpy` function and its fields are never modified.
3. The Coccinelle script identifies the usage of `def_qos_parameters` in the `memcpy` function and suggests constifying it.
4. The patch adds the `const` qualifier to the declaration of `def_qos_parameters`.
5. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on this analysis, the patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it constifies a structure that is only used as a source parameter in `memcpy` and does not introduce any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a local variable from "nr_irqs" to "nr_irq" in two different files. This change resolves a naming collision warning triggered by the use of "nr_irqs" as a local variable name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing forward declarations of structures in cpuidle.h. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the pinctrl-mtk-common.c file. The patch adds a missing free operation for the "configs" variable, which is allocated using kmemdup. 

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the gpio-ml-ioh driver. The patch modifies the ioh_gpio_get() function to ensure that the return value is clamped to [0,1] by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding entries in the HID table and referencing the "bytcht_da7213" driver. This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding support for a specific hardware configuration.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the socket argument in the function `tcp_create_openreq_child()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the code in drivers/acpi/osl.c.
2. It changes the allocation function from kmalloc to kzalloc, which allocates and initializes memory to zero.
3. The patch adds comments to explain the purpose of the code and its relation to lockdep complaints.
4. It rearranges the code related to workqueues and initializes the work struct using INIT_WORK().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to improve code readability and prevent false positive lockdep complaints.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch appears to address a logical issue in the rsi_send_data_pkt() function. It moves the initialization of the 'status' variable from the top of the function to the actual error handling code. This change makes the code more readable and aligns with the logical flow of the function.

The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on improving the code logic.

The commit message has been rewritten and the controversial bits have been deleted, which suggests that the patch has gone through some review and refinement.

Overall, the patch seems to fix a real issue and does not introduce any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is adding a platform device registration for the HDMI audio codec on OMAP4-based boards. This would enable the transmission of audio through the HDMI output on Pandaboard and PandaboardES boards.

Since this patch is adding functionality to support a specific hardware feature, it does not appear to fix a critical bug or address any issues related to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch would fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it does not address any critical issues. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ath6kl: configure SDIO when power is reapplied." It suggests that when power is removed from the device, the SDIO settings return to default, and this patch aims to fix that by reconfiguring after power is reapplied.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The patch adds a new function called "ath6kl_sdio_config" which is responsible for configuring the SDIO settings.

4. The "ath6kl_sdio_power_on" function is modified to call the "ath6kl_sdio_config" function after a delay of 10 milliseconds.

5. If the "ath6kl_sdio_config" function fails to configure the SDIO, an error message is printed, and the function returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to SDIO configuration after power is reapplied. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a condition that is reported as impossible. The patch removes a test for an impossible condition where `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. However, the condition `path > 0` is still present.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It appears to be a trivial fix, removing a test for an impossible condition. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch enables PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs, specifically for the r8a7792 (R-Car V2H), r8a7793 (R-Car M2-N), and r8a7794 (R-Car E2) SoCs. The patch also adds checks to exclude certain machine types from enabling PM runtime.

Since this patch enables PM runtime for new SoCs and adds necessary checks, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch fixes a bug in the host1x_bo_lookup() function in the Tegra DRM driver. Currently, the function returns 0 when the drm_gem_object_lookup() call fails to find a gem object. However, returning 0 implies success, which is incorrect in this case. The patch changes the return value to NULL, which accurately represents the failure to find a gem object.

This bug fix is not trivial as it addresses a logical error in the code. It does not involve any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. Additionally, the bug fix does not introduce any new issues or risks.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or crashes, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated `hid_output_raw_report` function with the recommended `hid_hw_output_report` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and modifies the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function to accept the frequency as an argument instead. Additionally, it sets the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer.

Since this patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the omapdrm driver's framebuffer initialization code. It changes the log level of certain error messages from "error" to "debug". The reason for this change is to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer object size issues.

The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by reducing the log level of non-critical error messages. This change helps to avoid unnecessary clutter in the kernel log caused by userspace validation failures.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on improving the logging behavior of the driver.

Therefore, considering the nature of the patch and its impact on the stability and usability of the Linux kernel, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing an unnecessary check before calling the `vfree()` function in the `asihpi_adapter_remove()` function of the `hpioctl.c` file in the ALSA asihpi driver. The patch claims that the `vfree()` function already performs input parameter validation, making the check redundant.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a "trivial" fix, removing an unnecessary check.

Therefore, based on the given criteria, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only moves the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` to the file `smilsub.c` and removes the unnecessary declaration in `smilmain.c`. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. The patch sets the appropriate exit reason and suberror codes when instruction emulation fails, allowing for better error reporting to userspace.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to error reporting, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` to accept a `struct msghdr *msg` parameter instead of `void *from`. This change allows the function to directly access the `msg` structure, which contains information about the message being sent.

2. In the `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` function, the patch replaces the call to `memcpy_fromiovecend()` with `memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, msg->msg_iter.iov, 0, length)`. This change copies the data from the `msg` structure's `msg_iter.iov` field to the `iph` buffer.

3. In the `rawv6_sendmsg()` function, the patch updates the call to `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` to pass the `msg` structure itself instead of casting `msg->msg_iter.iov` to `(struct iovec *)`. This change ensures that the `msg` structure is passed correctly to `rawv6_send_hdrinc()`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making necessary changes to improve the handling of IPv6 raw socket messages. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the function signature and updates the data copying mechanism. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it addresses a real and critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the appropriate Linux kernel maintainers or experts to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the failure logging into the `isl29028_set_als_scale()` function. This change reduces code duplication and improves code maintainability. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a spelling mistake in the comments of the zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c files. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches that contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that only renames a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a separate function for resetting shadow counters in the perf stat tool. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only updates the initialization of the ".n_bitrates" field in the mwifiex_band_2ghz structure to use the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead of hardcoding the value.

Since this change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a spelling change or whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility on the s390 architecture. This facility is being detected by setting the `has_ibs` flag in the `sclp_info` structure.

Since this patch is adding support for a new hardware facility, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the bcm47xxnflash driver for MTD (Memory Technology Devices) in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` that checks the readiness of the device. This function is used to determine if the device is ready for further operations. This seems like a valid addition and could potentially fix a bug related to device readiness.

2. The patch also modifies the `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_init` function to set the `dev_ready` function pointer of the `nand_chip` structure to `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready`. This indicates that the added `dev_ready` function will be used to check the device readiness during initialization. This modification seems reasonable and aligns with the added functionality.

3. Additionally, the patch sets the `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure to 50. This value represents the delay in microseconds between chip select and command execution. This change could potentially address timing-related issues or improve performance.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch adds functionality to the bcm47xxnflash driver and does not appear to be a trivial fix. It introduces a new function, modifies the initialization function, and adjusts a timing parameter. However, without further context or information about the bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the bug fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it adds new functionality and potentially addresses a bug related to device readiness. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being fixed would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the scanmask value for NEC remotes in the tm6000 driver. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the firmware image filename for the xc4000 tuner. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, I will analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to fix a termios/port flags mismatch in the serial core driver. It ensures that the ASYNC_CTS_FLOW and ASYNC_CHECK_CD flags are set/cleared after calling the port driver's .set_termios method. This fix prevents potential issues with termios settings being overridden by the port driver.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch moves the `qos_request` field from `saa7134_fh` structure to `saa7134_dev` structure.
   - The `qos_request` field is a global field, not a per-filehandle field.

2. Changes in saa7134-video.c:
   - Line 2205: The `pm_qos_add_request` function is modified to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.
   - Line 2220: The `pm_qos_remove_request` function is modified to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.

3. Changes in saa7134.h:
   - Line 472: The `qos_request` field is removed from the `saa7134_fh` structure.
   - Line 595: The `qos_request` field is added to the `saa7134_dev` structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is a cleanup and reorganization of the `qos_request` field in the `saa7134` driver. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves moving a field and removing it from a structure.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be fixing a specific issue related to handling ECC errors during the scanning of bad block markers in the MTD NAND driver. The patch modifies the behavior to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be a relatively minor change aimed at improving the handling of ECC errors during bad block marker scanning.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the initialization call from "__initcall" to "device_initcall" for the "sibyte_bus_watcher" function in the "bus_watcher.c" file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the Mellanox mlx5 network driver. It introduces a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` that allows setting the minimum inline header mode for virtual functions (VFs) in the Physical Function (PF) side.

The function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` takes the Mellanox device (`mdev`), the virtual port number (`vport`), and the minimum inline value (`min_inline`) as parameters. It initializes an input buffer `in` and sets the necessary fields for modifying the NIC vport context. Finally, it calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` with the input buffer to perform the modification.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a security issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or functionality to the Mellanox mlx5 driver. Without further context or information about the bug or issue it aims to fix, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant stakeholders to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the Btrfs file system. The patch ensures that if the file system is frozen, the auto defragmentation process does not run. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a specific behavior related to the auto defragmentation process in Btrfs.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the ternary operators using a GNU extension. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup and optimization of the ASoC adau17x1 CODEC driver. The patch removes the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the suspend function and SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in the resume function. Instead, it sets the suspend_bias_off flag to true in the codec driver structure.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. The changes do not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" and ".bus" fields from the b53_spi_driver structure. These fields are set automatically by the module_spi_driver() function. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the format string specifier for size_t variables in the HID cp2112 driver. The change replaces the use of "%d" with "%zd" in two debug print statements.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the way certain registers are accessed in the nva3_ram_ctor function. The original code directly accessed the registers, while the patch modifies it to use a stride function with a partition mask.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event` in the ASoC twl6040 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the ASoC max98090 codec driver. The patch introduces a new property "maxim,micbias" which allows the micbias voltage to be read from the device tree or ACPI. If the property is not found or if the value is out of range, it falls back to a default value of 2.8v.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not fix any of the mentioned critical issues. It is an enhancement to the driver, allowing the micbias voltage to be configured dynamically. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit in the patch_hdmi.c file of the sound/pci/hda directory. The regression caused incorrect assignment of the pin NID. The fix assigns the correct pin NID to the cvts[0] structure member.

Since this patch addresses a regression and fixes a critical bug that could potentially cause audio issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers: "dcssblk" and "xpram". The "owner" field is not necessary for platform drivers as it is automatically populated by the driver core.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes a trivial assignment, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture. The warning indicates a mismatch between the function leon_callin() and the function leon_configure_cache_smp() in terms of their initialization attributes.

Since this patch addresses a warning related to section mismatch and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the log level from `pr_info` to `pr_debug` for a success message when creating the chunk heap in the ion driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to define the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds definitions for the contiguous bit.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to mark the function `resiliency_test()` as `__init`, indicating that it should be placed in the `init.text` section and freed after boot. 

Since `resiliency_test()` is only called during the bootstrap process, marking it as `__init` and freeing it after boot can help optimize memory usage. This change does not appear to fix any real and critical bugs, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup change rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. This is a functional enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant NULL check and a check for DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch appears to address an issue related to initializing the correct nvm channel list for 8000 series devices in the iwlwifi driver. The comment in the code suggests that without this patch, the regulatory data will mistakenly contain only 7000 series channels.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a potential data corruption issue by ensuring that the correct channel list is used for 8000 series devices. This can be considered a real and critical bug, as it could lead to incorrect regulatory data and potentially impact the functionality of the affected devices.

Considering the nature of the issue and its potential impact, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption and ensures the correct functioning of the affected devices.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its implications would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch updates the code to use the `irq_set_affinity` function instead of a custom implementation. This change improves code maintainability and reduces duplication.

2. The patch also switches from using `for_each_irq_desc` to `for_each_active_irq`. This change ensures that only active IRQs are processed, which is more efficient.

3. The `route_irq` function, which is no longer used, is removed from the code.

4. The `migrate_irqs` function is modified to use `irq_set_affinity` instead of the deprecated `chip->irq_set_affinity` function. This change simplifies the code and improves compatibility.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a potential issue and improves the code. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the appropriate maintainers and reviewers to determine if the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the imp_known_replied_xid when trying to resend an already replied replay request.
2. The reason for updating imp_known_replied_xid is that the xid of the replay request could be less than the current imp_known_replied_xid.
3. The patch is signed-off by Niu Yawei and reviewed by Alex Zhuravlev and Fan Yong.
4. It is also signed-off by Oleg Drokin and Greg Kroah-Hartman.
5. The patch modifies the file drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/ptlrpc/recover.c.
6. The code change is in the ptlrpc_replay_next function.
7. If a request is found and imp_resend_replay is true, and the rq_unreplied_list is empty, the patch adds the request to the unreplied list and updates imp_known_replied_xid.
8. Finally, the imp_resend_replay flag is set to 0, and the imp_lock is unlocked.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to replaying requests in the Lustre staging driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves updating imp_known_replied_xid and adding the request to the unreplied list. However, without further context or information about the severity of the issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds module alias autogeneration for AMBA drivers in the nomadik-rng.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a comment typo in the PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_CLKPM definition. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. It only corrects a spelling mistake in a comment.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary assignment to the variable "mq_rq" in the mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq() function. This assignment is not used after the jump, and it seems to be confusing and unnecessary.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and it only removes a trivial assignment, I would classify it as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization for ARMv6 and later processors. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the sti_vtg driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a missing of_node_put call after calling of_parse_phandle, which is necessary to release the reference to the device node obtained from of_parse_phandle.

Since this patch addresses a potential resource leak and ensures proper memory management, it can be considered a valid fix. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a critical bug or a real issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would need more information to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "__init" annotation from the "gpmc_hwecc_bch_capable" and "gpmc_nand_init" functions in the "gpmc-nand.c" file. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch mainly involve converting the set_frontend and get_frontend functions to use DVBv5 parameters instead of the dvb_frontend_parameters struct.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains only trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding the necessary MFD (Multi-Function Device) cell information for the axp288 power key device. This indicates that it is addressing a specific hardware functionality related to the axp288 PMICs.

Since the patch is adding essential functionality for a specific device, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames the type PVOID to "void *" in Misc.c, it appears to be a trivial fix involving a simple renaming of a type. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch is simply replacing the individual calls to `platform_driver_register` and `platform_driver_unregister` with the new helper functions `platform_register_drivers` and `platform_unregister_drivers`.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only introduces a minor code change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the "err_request_irq" label up, but it does not address any specific issue or bug. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to indicate that a set contains expressions for evaluation. This flag is mutually exclusive with the NFT_SET_MAP flag, and sets specifying both are rejected. Additionally, the patch includes a check in the nf_tables_newset function to ensure that only one of NFT_SET_MAP or NFT_SET_EVAL is specified.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be an enhancement or feature addition rather than a bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific adaptation for the OMAP3-based igep0020 board to accommodate changes in the ehci-omap driver. The patch primarily involves registering the PHY's RESET regulators and the NOP PHY devices using the `usbhs_init_phys()` function.

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a specific adaptation for a particular hardware board, which does not fall under the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for port mirroring in the bcm_sf2 driver for DSA switches. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, let's check if the patch fixes a real and critical bug. The patch description does not mention any specific bug being fixed, so it is unclear if this patch addresses a critical issue.

Next, we need to assess if the patch causes any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. The patch does not introduce any new code or modifications that could potentially cause these issues. However, without further context or information, it is difficult to determine if the patch itself is free from such problems.

Lastly, we need to verify if the patch contains any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. The provided patch does not include any such changes.

Based on the information available, it is not possible to definitively determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further investigation and clarification are required to assess the criticality of the bug being fixed and to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended issues.

Therefore, the appropriate decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the vmwgfx driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch title suggests that it addresses an error path related to cursor handling in the vmwgfx driver.

2. The patch is signed-off by Jakob Bornecrantz and reviewed by Thomas Hellstrom, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

3. The code change itself adds a call to "vmw_surface_unreference" when a surface is not suitable for the cursor. This suggests that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to cursor functionality.

4. The added error message "surface not suitable for cursor" indicates that the patch is addressing a potential problem that could impact the user experience or functionality of the driver.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to cursor handling in the vmwgfx driver. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a superfluous check and a stray newline. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue. The patch only modifies the declaration of a structure to make it const. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug it fixes, such as whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of allowing users to write negative values directly to the sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance file. The patch adds a check to ensure that negative values are not accepted. If a negative value is encountered, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid argument.

This patch improves the validation of user input and prevents potential issues that could arise from allowing negative values. While it may not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption, it does address an issue that falls under the "oh, that's not good" category. It ensures that the sysfs interface is used correctly and prevents users from setting invalid values.

Therefore, considering the nature of the patch and its potential impact on system behavior, it is reasonable to include it in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch aims to fix a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior. In IPv4, when a machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

The patch modifies the UDP error handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. When the machine receives an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that affects the behavior of UDP sockets in IPv6. It addresses a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 and ensures consistent behavior for UDP sockets when receiving ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG messages.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the tty driver. The patch changes the return value from -ENOIOCTLCMD to -ENOTTY when the ioctl operation is not supported by the driver.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch should not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not address any of the mentioned critical issues. It is a fix for a specific error handling scenario, where the return value is changed from -EINVAL to -ENOTTY. This change does not fix a critical bug or address any security issue. It seems to be a minor improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devexit_p. This macro is no longer needed because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing the "bright_max" variable and directly setting the brightness value in the "netxbig_led_set" function. This change eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation.

However, it is important to note that the patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than fixing a specific problem.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific performance bottleneck issue when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. The patch sets the CmdQue bit in the standard INQUIRY data to 1.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific performance optimization for a particular use case.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and renaming of the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()`. The patch also moves the reference acquisition into the `init_and_link_css()` function.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This indicates that the function is only called in functions annotated with __init, which suggests that it is used during the initialization phase of the kernel.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature.

3. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only adds the __init prefix and renames the function.

Based on these observations, it seems that the patch addresses a potential resource cleanup issue during kernel initialization. While it may not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue related to resource management.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the code to use devm_ functions. This type of change is typically considered a "trivial" fix and does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `regmap_init_i2c()` with `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. This change is aimed at simplifying error handling and code cleanup by using a device-managed version of the function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for adding the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being addressed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.).

Please provide more information about the bug and any other relevant details so that I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks for the `moboard_uart0` function in the `mach-mx31moboard.c` file. These callbacks are responsible for initializing and cleaning up the UART0 device on the MX31moboard platform.

2. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is modified to remove the return type `int` and instead use `void`. It also removes the error handling for `gpio_request()` and `gpio_direction_output()` functions.

3. The `moboard_uart0_exit()` function is removed entirely.

4. The `uart0_pdata` structure is modified to remove the `init` and `exit` fields.

5. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is called in the `mx31moboard_init()` function to initialize UART0 on the MX31moboard platform.

6. In the `serial_imx_probe()` function in the `imx.c` file, the call to `pdata->init()` is removed.

7. The `serial_imx_remove()` function in the `imx.c` file no longer calls `pdata->exit()`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks and modifies the related functions and structures. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for initializing the BBP_R103 register in the rt2800 driver. The patch adds the initialization of BBP_R103 in various subroutines, depending on the specific hardware being used.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch initializes BBP_R103 in multiple subroutines, which suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to this register's initialization.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch does not explicitly mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

4. The patch does not include any comments or explanations about the specific problem it solves.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a critical bug or addresses a "real and critical" issue. Without more context or information about the problem it solves, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sizeimage setting in the coda driver for the media subsystem. The bug causes VIDIOC_TRY_FMT to return an incorrect value for sizeimage. The patch corrects this by calculating sizeimage as width * height * 3 / 2.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). 

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch aims to replace the usage of DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC macros for setting the number of transmit USB buffers (tx_buffers) in the vt6656 driver.

2. However, there are a few issues with the patch:
   a. The module_param_named macro is used incorrectly. It should be used to define a module parameter, but in this patch, it is used to define a variable (vnt_tx_buffers) instead of a module parameter.
   b. The module_param_named macro is also used with the wrong variable (vnt_rx_buffers) instead of vnt_tx_buffers.
   c. The check for the user setting tx_buffer beyond the defined limits of the driver is missing.

3. Additionally, the patch contains a typo in the MODULE_PARM_DESC macro usage, where it should describe the number of transmit USB tx buffers but mistakenly describes the number of receive USB tx buffers.

4. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a trivial fix for parameter handling.

Considering these issues, the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It contains trivial fixes, incorrect usage of macros, and lacks necessary checks. Therefore, I recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve replacing the usage of non-device managed APIs with their device managed counterparts. While this change may improve code simplicity and resource management, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "trivial" fixes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function call with a recommended one. The change does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to avoid an unnecessary register read in the i40e driver.

2. Change-Id: The Change-Id indicates that this patch has undergone some review and revision.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, indicating their agreement with the changes.

4. Tested-by: The patch has been tested by Sibai Li, indicating that it has undergone some testing.

5. Code Changes: The code changes involve removing the unnecessary register read and using the vf_base_id from the hardware structure instead.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a performance optimization or a minor improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary.
2. The function scsi_run_queue is split into two parts: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue.
3. The scsi_starved_list_run function is responsible for selecting a proper request queue to serve next.
4. The scsi_run_queue function is responsible for starting a new command if possible.
5. The scsi_single_lun_run function is called if the scsi_target has a single LUN.
6. The scsi_starved_list_run function is called if the starved_list is not empty.
7. Finally, the blk_run_queue function is called.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the efficiency of scsi_run_queue by avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and splitting the function into more clear parts. It also handles single LUN and starved_list scenarios appropriately.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential performance improvement and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on renaming a function and tidying up the code formatting. As per the guidelines, patches that contain only trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field from the "sl811h_driver" structure in the "sl811-hcd.c" file. The patch claims to fix the "platform_no_drv_owner.cocci" warnings.

Since this patch only removes a single line of code and does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a (B) "should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK)" as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field in the struct amba_device. This change removes the unnecessary NO_IRQ value, which is not critical to fixing any real bug or issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the platform data for SPI bus clocks in the ARM Samsung architecture. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes some platform data, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0 immediately.

3. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device corresponding to the given `ifindex`.

4. If the device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the master index of the device.

5. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index if the device was found, or 0 otherwise.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary helper function to perform a lookup of the l3mdev master index by device index. This functionality can be useful in various scenarios, such as routing and network management.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real functionality enhancement, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an uninitialized variable warning. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.), I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and adjusting indentation. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix to silence an integer overflow warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems. The patch moves the quirk for ALC255_FIXUP_DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE from the alc269_fixup_tbl to the alc269_pin_fixup_tbl.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is specific to the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems. It does not address a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug fix.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. However, it does not address a critical bug either.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch enables the use of PCI MSIs (Message Signaled Interrupts) for all PCIe devices in the rt2x00pci driver. While this change may improve performance or efficiency, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a type mismatch issue in the `capi20_manufacturer` function. The function is declared with an `unsigned int` argument, but it is called with an `unsigned long` argument. This type mismatch can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or bugs.
2. The patch corrects the function prototype to match the actual argument type used in the function call. This ensures that the function is correctly defined and used as part of the user-visible API.
3. The patch was spotted with Coverity, indicating that it was identified as a potential issue through static code analysis.
4. The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Since the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate error message. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro called "IS_MAC_ADDRESS_BROADCAST" from the file "rtl871x_ioctl_set.c" in the staging directory. The macro is not used anywhere in the code, and its removal does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that increases the required skbuff headroom for firmware signaling in the brcmfmac driver. The patch adds additional headroom to accommodate signaling protocol data between the host and firmware.

The patch includes changes to the brcmf_proto_bdc_header structure, adding a new field called data_offset. It also defines a maximum length for firmware signal data in the tx path. Additionally, the patch modifies the brcmf_proto_attach function to increase the hdrlen by the sum of BDC_HEADER_LEN and BRCMF_PROT_FW_SIGNAL_MAX_TXBYTES.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to firmware signaling and ensures that sufficient headroom is allocated for the signaling protocol data. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being addressed, its impact, and whether it falls into the categories of critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, real security issues, or "oh, that's not good" issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a "name" field to the omapdss's outputs structure. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag in the samples/seccomp/dropper.c file. This flag is required to enable seccomp, and the patch allows the dropper program to be run without requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to buffer pitch calculation in the Exynos DRM driver. The change modifies the calculation of the pitch value by using the expression `args->width * ((args->bpp + 7) / 8)` instead of `args->width * args->bpp >> 3`.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch fixes a bug related to buffer pitch calculation, which can impact the correct rendering of graphics in the Exynos DRM driver.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues directly. However, incorrect buffer pitch calculation can lead to rendering artifacts or incorrect display output, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific calculation issue in the code.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect display output.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "regulators" array in the lp3972.c file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup change.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable atomic fb-helper support in the i915 driver. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems that it does not fix a bug, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it enables a feature that is not yet advertised by the driver. Enabling atomic fb-helper support may be considered an improvement, but it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. However, it is important to note that the absence of trivial fixes alone does not make the patch suitable for inclusion in a stable release.

Considering the above analysis, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error handling for the function `hdmi_probe_pdata()`, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue or bug.

2. The function `hdmi_probe_pdata()` is modified to return an integer value instead of being a void function. This change allows for proper error propagation.

3. The patch introduces error handling for cases where `plat_dssdev` or `dssdev` is not found. Instead of simply returning, the function now returns 0 or -ENOMEM, indicating the specific error condition.

4. Error handling is also added for cases where device initialization or connection fails. The function now returns the appropriate error code instead of just returning.

5. In the `omapdss_hdmihw_probe()` function, the return value of `hdmi_probe_pdata()` is checked. If an error occurs, necessary cleanup actions are performed, and the function returns the error code.

Overall, the patch adds proper error handling to the `hdmi_probe_pdata()` function and ensures that errors are propagated correctly. It addresses potential issues and improves the stability of the HDMI driver. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to SDIO controllers found on Marvell Kirkwood SoCs. It mentions that these controllers cause a late, spurious IRQ even when all interrupts have been disabled. Although this IRQ doesn't cause any harm to the hardware or the driver, it can lead to "unexpected IRQ" warnings later.

To work around this issue, the patch introduces a check in the IRQ handler. If no IRQs are expected to occur (i.e., both normal and error interrupts are disabled), the handler bails out early and returns IRQ_HANDLED. It also logs a debug message with relevant register values for debugging purposes.

This patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue that can potentially cause unexpected warnings and improves the stability of the system.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. The patch modifies the qla2x00_gpn_id, qla2x00_gnn_id, and qla2x00_gfpn_id functions to stop iteration after the first failure. This change is made by introducing a "break" statement after setting the "rval" variable to QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. However, based solely on the patch itself, it does not seem to address a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless additional information is provided to demonstrate its criticality or significance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing inline wrappers for nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64 functions in the netlink subsystem. These functions are required to provide fields for nl802154 userspace applications.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the deprecated macro DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE(). It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch adds a call to `phy_suspend` when the `phydev` enters the HALTED state. However, there is no indication that this change fixes any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Additionally, the patch does not seem to have any impact on the stability or security of the Linux kernel. It is more of an optimization or power-saving enhancement rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some unused #defines from the wlan_bssdef.h file in the staging driver for the rtl8723au wireless chipset. The removed #defines are related to NDIS_802_11_STATUS_TYPE and authentication/integrity fields.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, does not address a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, and only removes unused #defines, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to refactor the soft_offline_page() function in the mm/memory-failure.c file. It addresses the issue of multiple return points randomly intermingled with some "goto done" return points. The patch adjusts the function structure to have separate paths for success and failure, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, the patch replaces the use of atomic_long_add with atomic_long_inc, which is a more appropriate function for incrementing atomic long variables.

The changes made in the patch do not fall under trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they improve the code structure and address potential issues related to soft offline of memory pages.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose and the absence of trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary out-of-memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that checks the return values of the nla_parse() function. This is important for ensuring that the attributes are actually what is expected, making the policy effective. The patch also includes error handling and returns appropriate error codes when necessary.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `of_find_property` with `of_property_read_u32` for reading integer values. This change aims to reduce the number of variables used.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a call to `seq_printf` with `seq_puts` for a specific string. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the i40e driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions in the i40e driver.
2. The functions are updated to take a u16 (unsigned 16-bit integer) instead of an s16 (signed 16-bit integer) as an argument.
3. Additionally, checks are added to ensure that the functions are not invoked when the VID (VLAN ID) is less than 1 or when the PVID (Port VLAN ID) is set.
4. If the VID is 0 or the PVID is set, the functions return -EINVAL (invalid argument) and do not perform any further operations.
5. The i40e_add_vlan_all_mac and i40e_rm_vlan_all_mac functions are called within the modified functions to add or remove VLAN membership for the given VID.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to VLAN handling in the i40e driver. It introduces necessary checks to prevent incorrect usage of the functions and ensures that the VLAN mode handling is not accidentally invoked when it shouldn't be. The changes do not appear to be trivial, as they involve modifying function arguments and adding conditional checks.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing an error return code in the `cpia1.c` file of the `gspca` driver in the `media` subsystem. The patch converts a nonnegative error return code to a negative one, aligning it with the return codes used elsewhere in the function.

Since this patch addresses an error return code, it can be considered a fix for a potential issue that could cause problems during execution. However, without further context or details about the specific bug or its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the NVRAM location from 14 to 16 for reading the SCSI host ID. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for adding support for the RT5645 codec with ACPI ID 10EC5640 and adding a DMI quirk for jack detection. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It appears to be adding support for a specific codec and adding a DMI quirk for jack detection. While this may be useful for specific hardware platforms, it does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where a null pointer is dereferenced in the original code. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The patch addresses this by introducing a new label "no_endpoints" and using it as the target of the "goto" statement when the memory allocation fails.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential null pointer dereference, which can be a critical bug causing crashes or security issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused code and removes a redundant assignment. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code and redundant assignment, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a constant value from `AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_RECOVERY` to `AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_INIT_RECOVERY`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to "unclaimed register" messages on Haswell after suspend/resume. The patch checks the generation of the Intel GPU and only saves/restores the DSPARB register if the generation is less than or equal to 4.

Since the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary Out-of-Memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the cs53l30 codec driver in the ASoC subsystem. The patch sets the `idle_bias_off` option to true, which ensures that the DAPM core sets the bias level to `SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF` instead of stopping at `SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY`. This change is intended to control the power on and off sequences correctly.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to power management in the codec driver, it does not seem to be a trivial fix. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other minor modifications. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the names of the SND_SOC_DAPM_SPK widgets and the corresponding routes in the skylake_map array. This change seems to be related to supporting MST moved pin to port.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the memory_lseek() function in the drivers/char/mem.c file. The patch replaces a comparison of the new offset with a hard-coded value of -MAX_ERRNO with the use of IS_ERR_VALUE() macro.

The change improves code readability and maintainability by using a standard macro instead of a hard-coded value. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch adds a definition for a regulator supply in the board file for better power management. However, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the TX wakeup bit for the wer register in OMAP2+ UART. This suggests that it fixes a potential issue related to waking up the UART module.

2. It also mentions that wer is not context restored and should be restored when the context is lost. This indicates that the patch addresses a potential issue with context restoration.

3. The patch includes Acked-by and Signed-off-by tags from relevant individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. It introduces new definitions for OMAP_UART_TX_WAKEUP_EN and OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP, which are used in the subsequent code changes.

5. The struct uart_omap_port is modified to include a new member, wer, which will hold the value for the wer register.

6. In the serial_omap_startup function, the patch sets the value of up->wer based on the features of the UART and writes it to the UART_OMAP_WER register. This ensures that the TX wakeup bit is enabled if the UART supports it.

7. The omap_serial_fill_features_erratas function is modified to set the OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP flag in the features member of the uart_omap_port structure for certain UART revisions.

8. The serial_omap_restore_context function is updated to restore the value of up->wer to the UART_OMAP_WER register when restoring the context.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to enabling the TX wakeup bit for the wer register in OMAP2+ UART. It also ensures proper context restoration for the wer register. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria for inclusion.

The patch titled "ixgbe: Add a new netdev op to allow/prevent a VF from querying an RSS info" adds a new netdev operation to enable or disable the ability of a specific Virtual Function (VF) to query its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It also limits the support for this feature to 82599 and x540 devices only, with plans to add support for other devices later.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, we can see that it adds a new field called "rss_query_enabled" to the "vf_data_storage" structure in "ixgbe.h". This field is then used in "ixgbe_main.c" and "ixgbe_sriov.c" to enable or disable the RSS query feature for each VF.

The patch also adds a new netdev operation called "ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en" in "ixgbe_netdev_ops" in "ixgbe_main.c". This operation is responsible for setting the RSS query feature for a specific VF.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch introduces a new feature related to Virtual Functions in the ixgbe driver. However, it does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to clock gating in the sunxi-mmc driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to gate the clock when the bus frequency is set to 0. This addresses an assumption made by the MMC core and ensures proper handling of this scenario.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the author, tester, and an additional reviewer, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and tested.

3. The patch modifies the `sunxi_mmc_clk_set_rate` function to return early if the clock frequency is 0, indicating that the clock should be gated. This prevents unnecessary clock operations when the frequency is 0.

4. The patch modifies the `sunxi_mmc_set_ios` function to remove the check for `ios->clock` when setting up the clock. Instead, it only checks `ios->power_mode`. This change suggests that the clock setup should always be performed when `ios->power_mode` is non-zero.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue related to clock gating and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip. The patch increases the total number of interrupts from 8 to 34, which aligns with the three different interrupt ranges handled by the TWL4030 (8 for the core, 8 for power events, and 18 for GPIOs).

Since this patch fixes a real issue related to interrupt management and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to extend the frequency range of the Max2165 tuner driver to cover Hong Kong's digital TV broadcasting. The change increases the maximum frequency from 780000000 to 862000000.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a configuration issue related to antenna diversity for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. The patch introduces conditional logic to set different values for the antenna configuration based on the chip type.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of non-AR9485 chips, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The bug fix is not trivial, as it involves modifying the values used for antenna diversity configuration based on the chip type.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to parenthesis alignment in the ppdev.c file. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it only addresses code formatting.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds an additional compatible string "marvell,armada370-audio" to the existing compatible strings "marvell,kirkwood-audio" and "marvell,dove-audio" in the device tree bindings for sound/mvebu-audio.txt. This allows the Kirkwood audio driver to be built on mvebu platforms, specifically for the Armada 370 variant.

2. In sound/soc/kirkwood/Kconfig, the patch modifies the dependency of SND_KIRKWOOD_SOC to include ARCH_MVEBU in addition to ARCH_KIRKWOOD and ARCH_DOVE. This ensures that the Kirkwood audio driver is selected when building the kernel for mvebu platforms.

3. In sound/soc/kirkwood/kirkwood-i2s.c, the patch adds the "marvell,armada370-audio" compatible string to the mvebu_audio_of_match array. This allows the Kirkwood audio driver to match with the Armada 370 audio unit.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch is necessary to enable the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically for the Armada 370 variant. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and addresses a real issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'thisboard' macro and replaces it with local variables and the comedi_board() helper function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the fec driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds support for specifying a custom reset duration for the phy-reset-gpios property in the device tree. This allows boards that require a longer reset duration to specify it in their device tree.

The patch also includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not longer than 1 second (1000 milliseconds). If a longer duration is specified, it is automatically set to 1 millisecond.

Considering that this patch addresses a specific requirement for certain boards and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting pointer math to array access. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the "nct7802_regmap_config" structure in the "hwmon/nct7802.c" file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the interrupt handling in the meson-gx-mmc driver. It removes the unnecessary disabling and re-enabling of interrupts in the meson_mmc_request function and instead enables interrupts in the probe function. Additionally, it adds the missing disabling of interrupts in the remove function.

The changes in the meson_mmc_request function remove the redundant interrupt handling code, which does not provide any benefit. This improves the code clarity and reduces the chances of introducing bugs related to interrupt handling.

In the meson_mmc_probe function, the patch enables interrupts by writing the IRQ_EN_MASK value to the SD_EMMC_IRQ_EN register. This ensures that interrupts are properly enabled during the initialization of the driver.

In the meson_mmc_remove function, the patch disables interrupts by writing 0 to the SD_EMMC_IRQ_EN register. This ensures that interrupts are properly disabled during the removal of the driver.

Overall, the patch improves the interrupt handling in the meson-gx-mmc driver, which can help prevent potential issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb_probe() function. The "__devinit" attribute is used to mark functions that are only called during device initialization and can be discarded after that. However, since the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option is going away, the "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed.

Given that this patch only removes a deprecated attribute and does not fix any real or critical bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compile warning in the ARM architecture's PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface) implementation. The patch simply adds a return statement with a value of 0 to the `psci_init` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve dropping unneeded checks and removing some conditional statements. Since the patch does not address any specific issue or bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug, nor does it fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch seems to be aimed at optimizing the code by avoiding redundant function calls.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unnecessary casting of a void pointer. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture's cache info code. The patch modifies the code to use the `of_read_number` function instead of directly accessing the device tree properties as `u32` pointers.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect cache size, line size, or number of sets being read on big-endian systems, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointer to the `musb` structure from the `tusb_omap_dma` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that makes the function `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch.pl issue related to lines exceeding 80 characters. This type of fix falls under the category of "trivial" changes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a few missing clocks for different MIPS platforms. The patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to be a routine maintenance patch rather than addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential issue with the order of operations in the dsa_slave_create() function. The patch ensures that the netdev is registered before connecting the phy, which avoids an info message with an uninitialized name.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch replaces the direct comparison of jiffies with a more robust and reliable function, time_before, for comparing jiffies against other values.

The change is aimed at improving the code's readability and maintainability by using a standardized function instead of a direct comparison. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential issue related to time calculations.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The changes made in this patch are related to logging messages and updating struct pointers. These changes do not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the usage of BUG_ON macro in the mmc_ext_csd_open function in the debugfs code for the MMC subsystem. Instead of triggering a BUG_ON when the value of 'n' is not equal to EXT_CSD_STR_LEN, the patch introduces error handling by returning an error value (-EINVAL) and jumping to the 'out_free' label.

The reasoning behind this change is that the author believes that the condition n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN is unlikely to occur. By propagating the error to the caller, the patch ensures that any potential issues are handled gracefully rather than triggering a kernel panic.

Since the patch addresses a potential issue and improves error handling, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It fixes a potential bug that could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, and it does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the attribute index for temperature sensors in the ixgbe driver to start with 1 instead of 0, following the hwmon ABI.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (changing attribute index), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a trivial issue related to casting the return value of kmalloc. The change removes the unnecessary casting of the void pointer returned by kmalloc.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the default behavior of the perf tools. The patch removes the "filter_relative" option, which is a relatively minor change and does not fix any critical bug or address any significant issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the mos7720.c driver to use the module_usb_serial_driver() call instead of having a module_init/module_exit function. This change eliminates duplicated code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary braces in the code. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves an assignment statement out of an if () block. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, which is not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch titled "hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host" aims to handle a scenario where the host reduces the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) due to headroom reservation for packet encapsulation. The patch modifies the code in the netvsc.c, netvsc_drv.c, and rndis_filter.c files.

Upon analyzing the patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to MTU handling in the Hyper-V network driver. It introduces changes to correctly handle the reduced MTU value set by the host when using packet encapsulation. The patch modifies the initialization of the MTU value in the nvsp_message structure, checks the MTU limit in the netvsc_change_mtu function, and retrieves the MTU value from the host in the rndis_filter_device_add function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to MTU handling in the Hyper-V network driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of using the lookup table to set the baud rate only when the ioclk is 150MHz. It mentions that some boards might set ioclk to a different frequency.

2. The patch recalculates the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz.

3. The patch also includes changes to get the clk in the probe function and put it in remove.

4. The patch modifies the sirfsoc_uart_set_termios function by removing the assignment of ioclk_rate to 150000000.

5. The patch adds a condition to the fast calculation of the clk_div_reg based on the uartclk value being 150000000.

6. The patch sets the port's uartclk value to the rate obtained from the clk in the probe function.

7. The patch adds the clk variable to the sirfsoc_uart_port structure.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the baud rate calculation when the ioclk is not 150MHz. It also includes necessary changes to handle the clk in the probe and remove functions.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the baud rate calculation and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the open-coded function `_regulator_is_enabled()` with a function call. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the variable "num_drc_entries" from an unsigned int to an atomic_t type. This change allows for removing the spinlocking around the variable, which improves performance and eliminates potential race conditions.

The patch also updates the code to use atomic operations for incrementing and decrementing the "num_drc_entries" variable. This ensures that the variable is modified atomically and avoids any potential concurrency issues.

Additionally, the patch modifies the functions that access the "num_drc_entries" variable to use atomic operations instead of spinlocks. This ensures that the variable is accessed safely and consistently.

Overall, this patch addresses a critical issue related to concurrency and improves the performance of the code. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it exports the `confirm_error_lock` symbol so that it can be used in the PCI surprise hot remove path to freeze the affected PE. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code refactoring or an enhancement rather than a bug fix. 

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a formatting issue in the perf trace code. The patch adds a closing parenthesis ')' to the fprintf statement in the trace__sys_enter function. This change is necessary because the function does not return, so there is no raw_syscalls:sys_exit event for it.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment in the cxgb4vf driver. The patch adds the missing increment of the VLAN extraction counter when a VLAN tag is present in the received packet.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL function in the amdgpu driver. The patch adds amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in different cases of the switch statement, ensuring that the BO is unreserved before returning from the function.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch splits the function `media_graph_walk_next()` into two functions, `media_graph_walk_iter()` and `media_graph_walk_next()`. This refactoring does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable oprofile support on Lantiq targets. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch aims to address. Could you provide more information about the problem this patch solves?
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an AUXDATA entry for the "nvidia,tegra30-ahub" device in the tegra30_auxdata_lookup array. This entry is necessary for clock lookups to work correctly for the Tegra30 I2S and AHUB modules.

Since this patch is adding a required entry for clock lookups, it can be considered a fix for a critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as build errors, oops, or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the `finit_module` syscall in the SH architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about the bug or issue it is intended to fix. 

Without further context or details, it is difficult to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. As it stands, I would lean towards not accepting this patch (B) until more information is provided about the bug or issue it addresses.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the return value of the `rb532_gpio_get` function by using the `!!` design pattern to clamp the return value to [0,1]. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the twl6040 driver in the mfd subsystem. The patch checks the return value of the clk_prepare_enable() function and propagates the error in case of failure. This is important because clk_prepare_enable() can fail, and it is necessary to handle such failures properly.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring change rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch aims to remove duplicate code by having the ftrace arch_ftrace_update_code() use the generic ftrace_modify_all_code(). It also requires making the default ftrace_replace_code() function a weak function so that an architecture can override it.

Since this patch does not address any real and critical bug, and it is more of a code refactoring change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check for `sp->role.invalid` and `is_obsolete_sp()` in the `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page()` function before calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`.
2. The added check ensures that `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` is only called if the page is not marked as invalid and is not obsolete.
3. The comment explains that obsolete pages cannot be used on any vCPUs.
4. The patch also updates the `sp->role.invalid` flag to 1.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of invalid and obsolete pages in the KVM MMU. It introduces a necessary check to prevent calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` on pages that should not be used.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the KVM subsystem, it can be classified as a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()` to disable the ISA DMA controller and return the residue as described in `Documentation/DMA-ISA-LPC.txt`. This seems like a useful addition to the code.

2. The patch modifies the `disable_dma_on_even()` function to use the new helper function `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `get_dma_residue()`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The `das16_interrupt()` function is modified to remove the unnecessary claim and release of the DMA lock. This change simplifies the code and improves performance.

4. The `das16_alloc_dma()` function is modified to use the new helper function `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `release_dma_lock()`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces necessary improvements to the code without any trivial changes. It addresses the DMA controller disabling and residue retrieval in a more consistent and readable manner. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the nct6775 driver in the hwmon subsystem. The patch introduces a new function called "add_temp_sensors" which scans for additional temperature sources and enables monitoring if available. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

In this case, the patch does not seem to fix a bug or address a critical issue. It appears to be adding functionality to detect and report additional temperature sources. While this may be useful for some users, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or addressing a real security issue.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to USB endpoint types in the dwc3 gadget driver. The patch replaces a BUG() statement with a dev_WARN() statement, which warns about an unknown endpoint type instead of causing a system crash.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue but does not fall into the category of a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on improving error handling and providing a warning message.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that it fixes a vendor command interface issue. This suggests that it addresses a specific problem rather than a trivial fix.

2. The patch includes several "Reviewed-by" and "Signed-off-by" tags from individuals who have reviewed and approved the changes. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review and testing.

3. Looking at the code changes, it seems that the patch modifies the handling of vendor commands in the brcmf_cfg80211_vndr_cmds_dcmd_handler function. It changes the way the interface is obtained and used for executing the vendor commands.

4. The change appears to be addressing a potential issue where the vendor commands were always using the main interface, and now they will use the interface supplied by the caller. This change could potentially fix a bug or improve the behavior of the driver.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the vendor command interface in the brcmfmac driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix a bug or improve the driver's behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch suggests holding the spinlock for a shorter duration inside the loop in the `ulite_isr` function.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the mxs platform. The patch corrects the 'direction' parameter of the device_prep_dma_cyclic function by changing it from DMA_TO_DEVICE to DMA_MEM_TO_DEV for playback and from DMA_FROM_DEVICE to DMA_DEV_TO_MEM for capture.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

From the patch description and code changes, it seems that this patch is addressing a functional issue related to the direction of data transfer in the ASoC driver. However, it does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it seems to be a functional improvement or correction.

Therefore, based on the given criteria, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it suggests printing a message to let the user know they could try using "pci=realloc" if some PCI device resources are unassigned. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a suggestion for the user to try a boot option.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing static storage class specifiers in the udl_connector.c file. The patch addresses sparse warnings related to undeclared symbols and suggests making certain functions and structures static.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and only addresses sparse warnings, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that replaces the usage of 0 and 1 with the true and false defines for boolean variables. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with the alternatives patching on secondary CPUs in the arm64 architecture. The patch adds an "isb" instruction after the secondary polling loop to ensure that the patched instruction stream is visible to the CPU.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not address any of the mentioned critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or correctness improvement rather than fixing a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the driver does not pass the number of tasks to the QM (Queue Manager) init logic. This can cause back-pressure in scenarios requiring many tasks, leading to reduced performance.

2. Impact: The issue described in the patch can potentially impact performance in scenarios where a large number of tasks are required, such as when using max MRs (Memory Regions). This suggests that it could be a real and critical bug affecting system performance.

3. Code Changes: The patch adds a new parameter, "num_tids," to the "params" structure in the "qed_qm_init_pf" function. This parameter is then assigned the value of "iids.tids," which represents the number of tasks.

4. Analysis: The patch addresses a specific issue by ensuring that the number of tasks is passed to the QM init logic. This fix can potentially prevent back-pressure and improve performance in scenarios requiring many tasks.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can impact system performance and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a failure in adding a default route when a nonsensical route is added before Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) work is started.

2. The bug can lead to unexpected behavior: The route lookup will pick the wrong outdev (eth0) due to the prefix route that is added before DAD work is completed.

3. The patch adds an explicit test: The patch introduces a check to verify if the nexthop gateway is a local address. This ensures that the route lookup correctly identifies the outdev.

4. The patch is not a trivial fix: It introduces a significant change to the code logic and adds a necessary check to prevent the bug.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and prevent potential issues with route lookup and outdev selection.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a copy/paste error in the code. The change only modifies a single line by correcting the link activation from "B" to "A" for the CSTM (LVDS, link A/B, upper) configuration.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error on the arm64 architecture. Build errors can prevent the kernel from being compiled correctly, so fixing them is important. However, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it only adds a definition for a constant. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in stable releases. Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a coding issue where the boolean variable 'found' is not initialized and contains garbage. The patch initializes 'found' to false, which is the correct behavior.

Since this patch addresses a coding error and does not involve trivial changes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a compiler warning related to a debug print statement in the iommu.c file. The change modifies the format specifier for the "pgsize" variable in the pr_debug statement.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions in the MIPS tlbex code. The bug was introduced by commit c5b367835cfc, which assumed a constant offset for certain PTE bits relative to _PAGE_PRESENT. However, this assumption is no longer true for some MIPS32R2 builds due to commit be0c37c985ed, which rearranged the PTE bits.

The patch addresses this issue by using the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask instead of hardcoding the values. It also includes the necessary fixes for both build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause build errors or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `gb_tty_probe` function by replacing the call to `greybus_set_drvdata` with an assignment to `gdev->gb_tty`. This change ties the `gb_tty` structure to the `gdev` structure properly.

2. The patch also modifies the `gb_tty_disconnect` function by replacing the call to `greybus_get_drvdata` with an assignment to `gb_tty` from `gdev->gb_tty`. This change retrieves the `gb_tty` structure from the `gdev` structure correctly.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making necessary changes to properly tie the `gb_tty` structure to the `gdev` structure in both the `gb_tty_probe` and `gb_tty_disconnect` functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and it does not contain any "trivial" fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the LRW cipher implementation in the Linux kernel. The patch defines a constant `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` with a value of 16, which represents the fixed block size of the LRW cipher. This constant is then used in place of the `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` function calls throughout the code.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue related to the LRW cipher, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the argument "virq" to "irq" in the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map`. This change removes the misleading "virtual" terminology from the argument name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Wacom HID driver. The patch aims to extend the recognition of certain fields by the WACOM_PEN_FIELD and WACOM_FINGER_FIELD macros. It introduces new usages (WACOM_G9_PEN, WACOM_G9_TOUCHSCREEN, WACOM_HID_G11_PEN, and WACOM_HID_G11_TOUCHSCREEN) that should be checked by the macros.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to setting the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag in the clone_mnt function in fs/namespace.c. The patch checks if the CL_EXPIRE flag is set and if the old->mnt_expire list is empty before setting the MNT_LOCKED flag in mnt->mnt.mnt_flags.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based solely on the provided patch, it does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It appears to be a code improvement or a non-critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a quirk for the ASUS X75VD laptop to fix Wi-Fi functionality. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a Wi-Fi issue on the ASUS X75VD laptop, which can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? 
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a prefix to the print format in the asymmetric key signature handling code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses warnings reported by the compiler. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that marks a function as static to address a warning during the build process. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a warning related to missing prototypes), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces two new knobs, "idgen_retries" and "idgen_delay", to the IPv6 subsystem. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. 

The patch modifies the "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6" in "include/net/netns/ipv6.h" to include the new knobs "idgen_retries" and "idgen_delay". It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c" and adds them to the sysctl table in "net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c".

The patch also modifies the "addrconf_dad_failure" function in "net/ipv6/addrconf.c" to use the new knobs for retries and delay when generating stable addresses. Similarly, the "ipv6_generate_stable_address" function in "net/ipv6/addrconf.c" is modified to use the new knobs for retries.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces new knobs specified by RFC 7217.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to auto-mute or auto-mic functionality in the ALSA HDA (High Definition Audio) driver. It ensures that when a jack is retasked as a different direction (e.g., a mic jack used as a CLFE output), it is not counted as the target for automatic jack switching.

The patch introduces two changes in the code:

1. In the `detect_jacks` function, it skips the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed. This prevents pins retasked as inputs from being detected as present.

2. In the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function, it skips the detection of pins retasked as outputs. This ensures that only the appropriate pins are considered for mic autoswitching.

These changes help avoid potential issues that could arise from incorrect jack detection and retasking, which could lead to unexpected behavior or audio problems.

The patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could cause audio-related issues or unexpected behavior. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a build error by adding a missing declaration for the `cmpxchg64` function. Since it addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves adding a missing declaration.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. The patch calculates the location of query 8 dynamically instead of hardcoding the offset. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. It seems to be a non-trivial fix that improves the code's flexibility and maintainability. However, it does not address any critical bug or issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the application of feature fixups earlier in the initialization process for 64-bit PowerPC architecture. While this change may have an impact on MMU management and interrupts, it does not address any specific issue or bug.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported in the zl10353 driver for DVB frontends. The patch changes the calculation of the SNR value from a raw hardware register value to a value in a 0.1 dB scale.

While this change may improve the accuracy of the reported SNR, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the renesas-irqc driver. The changes include adding more register documentation and defining register addresses for various interrupt-related registers.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds documentation and register definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a "line over 80" issue, which is related to code formatting and does not fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. The error is caused by the 'rspi_of_match' variable being undeclared in the 'rspi_probe' function of the 'spi-rspi.c' file.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (A) to accept this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi driver. The patch modifies the if condition by changing the logical OR operator (||) to a logical AND operator (&&). 

The original if condition checks if the sscanf function successfully reads an integer from the buf string and if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the patch changes the logical OR operator to a logical AND operator, which means that the condition will only be true if both the sscanf function fails to read an integer and the mode is not equal to 2 or 1.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch introduces a logical error. The intention of the patch is likely to ensure that the mode variable is either 2 or 1, but the modified condition will always evaluate to true. This means that the function will always return -EINVAL, regardless of the value of mode.

Considering that the patch introduces a logical error and does not fix a real and critical bug, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with the SPI_BPW_MASK macro in two different drivers: spi-bfin-v3.c and spi-ti-qspi.c. The SPI_BPW_MASK macro is used to define the bits_per_word_mask field in the spi_master structure.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for the wil6210 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds debug prints for vring deallocation in the `wil_vring_free` function.

Since this patch only adds debug prints and does not fix any real and critical bugs, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves some variables from one file to another. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains some trivial changes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to avoid common clk framework warnings. This change seems to be addressing a potential issue related to clock handling.

2. The patch adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_start` function. If either of these calls fails, the function will return the error code and clean up resources before exiting. This is a good practice for error handling.

3. Similarly, the patch adds error handling for `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_stop` function. This ensures that the clocks are properly disabled and unprepared before exiting the function.

4. In the `usba_udc_probe` function, the patch adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls for the `pclk` clock. If `clk_prepare_enable` fails, an error message is printed, and the function aborts. This ensures that the `pclk` clock is properly enabled before accessing the hardware.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses potential issues related to clock handling and adds proper error handling. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __func__ argument from the dev_err function calls in the gdm72xx driver. This change removes the specific instance of the device from the log printout.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, specifically in the advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma() function and the asc_build_req() function. This is important as DMA mapping can fail, and it is necessary to handle such errors.

2. In the advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma() function, if the DMA mapping fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns 0. This ensures that the sense buffer is not used if the mapping fails.

3. In the asc_build_req() function, if the sense buffer mapping fails, the function returns ASC_BUSY, indicating that the request cannot be built. This prevents further processing of the request and handles the error condition appropriately.

4. Similarly, in the same function, if the scatter-gather list mapping fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns ASC_BUSY. This ensures that the request is not processed if the mapping fails.

5. In the adv_build_req() function, the same error handling logic is applied for sense buffer mapping and scatter-gather list mapping.

6. In the asc_execute_scsi_cmnd() function, if the request building fails, the function returns the appropriate error code, indicating the failure.

Overall, the patch adds necessary error handling for DMA mapping failures in the advansys driver, ensuring that potential issues are properly handled. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "trivial" fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds two new registers, `rimsc` and `fimsc`, to the `struct nmk_gpio_chip` in the `gpio-nomadik.c` file. These registers are used to cache values from the GPIO controller.

2. In the `__nmk_gpio_set_mode_safe` function, instead of reading the values from the GPIO controller, the patch uses the cached values `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the `nmk_chip` structure. This change improves performance by avoiding unnecessary reads from the hardware.

3. In the `__nmk_gpio_irq_modify` function, the patch introduces changes to handle different types of interrupts (`WAKE` and `NORMAL`). It updates the `rimsc` and `fimsc` registers based on the interrupt type and the enable/disable flag. The patch also uses the cached values `rimscval` and `fimscval` from the `nmk_chip` structure instead of reading from the hardware.

4. In the `nmk_gpio_wakeups_suspend` function, the patch removes the unnecessary reads of `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the GPIO controller. Instead, it uses the cached values `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the `nmk_chip` structure to update the registers.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a performance optimization by caching register values. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Instead, this patch seems to be adding functionality to parse out the ECC (Error Correction Code) information for full-id NAND chips. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes some local functions and replaces them with existing helper functions. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unused parameter `*pPacket` from the function `s_cbFillTxBufHead`. The patch also replaces the usage of `pPacket` with `skb->data` in the `memcpy` call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adds the "const" qualifier to the "ab8500_cell" structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch implements the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations for the vb2 queue in the uvcvideo driver. While this change may improve the functionality of the driver, it does not address any real and critical bugs or issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability and does not introduce any functional changes. It changes the return type of the function `is_file_hugepages()` from `int` to `bool` and simplifies the implementation by removing an unnecessary if condition.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "__always_unused" attribute to the "filter_mask" parameter in the "i40e_ndo_bridge_getlink" function. This attribute is used to indicate that the parameter is intentionally unused and should not trigger any warnings or errors during compilation.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (adding an attribute), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an acknowledgment of the TX done interrupt in "level mode" for the nps_enet driver. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an endian bug in the cpufreq_get_max_state() function in the drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c file. The bug causes incorrect storage of low values in the high bits of an unsigned long variable, resulting in a very high value instead. 

Considering that this bug can potentially lead to incorrect behavior and data corruption, it qualifies as a real and critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes a global variable and moves it into a function. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add soft reset controller support for STiH415 and includes new softreset lines required for other device tree nodes in the header file. However, it does not specify any real and critical bug fixes or issues that it addresses.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the purpose and impact of the soft reset controller support, as well as any associated bug reports or issues that this patch aims to resolve. Without this additional context, I cannot determine whether the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of the hash function in the sch_fq.c file.
2. The patch replaces the existing hash_32() function with hash_ptr() for 64-bit architectures.
3. The reason for this change is that the author, Eric Dumazet, initially chose hash_32() due to performance issues with hash_ptr() on 64-bit architectures.
4. However, Linus Torvalds and George Spelvin have fixed the performance issues with hash_ptr(), making it a better choice for 64-bit architectures with large amounts of memory.
5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and Cc'd to Hugh Dickins.
6. The patch is also signed-off by David S. Miller, who is a well-known kernel developer.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a performance issue and improves the hash function usage on 64-bit architectures with large memory sizes. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is signed-off by multiple developers, including a well-known kernel developer.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: arche-apb: Don't use gpio after failing to request it." This suggests that it addresses an issue related to the usage of GPIO after a failed request.

2. The patch includes a fix for a potential issue where the direction of a GPIO pin is set even after a failed request for that GPIO pin.

3. The patch checks the return value of the `devm_gpio_request()` function. If it returns an error, the patch logs a warning message and does not proceed with setting the direction of the GPIO pin.

4. If the `devm_gpio_request()` function succeeds, the patch sets the direction of the GPIO pin to output.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where the direction of a GPIO pin is set even after a failed request. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could cause issues with GPIO usage.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the fuse filesystem in the Linux kernel. The patch changes the usage of `file->f_inode` to `file_inode(file)` in the `fuse_file_fallocate()` function.

The change is a simple replacement of the `file->f_inode` expression with the `file_inode(file)` function call. This change is not a trivial fix as it is not a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. It seems to address a potential issue related to accessing the inode of the file.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if the bug is critical or if it causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops in the tps65023-regulator.c driver. The patch does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It only makes the mentioned structs const, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ath9k: Check beaconing mode properly"
   The patch aims to improve the beaconing mode check in the ath9k driver.

2. Patch Description:
   In MCC (Multi-Channel Concurrency) mode, the Time Synchronization Function (TSF) of a context needs to be adjusted only if it is a Group Owner/Access Point (GO/AP).

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - Line 260: A new check is added to verify if the previous channel switch should occur after the beacon is transmitted. If not, the function returns without adjusting the TSF.
   - Line 263: The current TSF value is obtained using the ath9k_hw_get_tsf_offset() function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the beaconing mode check in the ath9k driver. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a real security issue. Additionally, I would need to know if the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information or context about the bug being fixed, and I will be able to give a more accurate assessment of whether this patch should be accepted in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that switches the OMAP platform to use the sched_clock_register() function instead of the deprecated setup_sched_clock() function. This change allows the 32-bit sched_clock interface to support 64-bit values.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed functions that automatically handle resource cleanup. This conversion reduces code size and simplifies the code.

The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they improve the code by using devm_kzalloc and devm_hwmon_device_register functions, which handle memory allocation and device registration in a more efficient and error-handling manner.

The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. However, it improves the code by using recommended functions and simplifying it.

Therefore, while the patch does not address a critical bug or security issue, it is a valid improvement to the codebase and can be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary function call. The patch removes the second call to the function `i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()` in the `do_cmd` function of the `adl_pci9111` driver. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a lockdep_assert_held() call in the fence_signal_locked() function of the dma-buf/fence.c file.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming the camellia module to camellia_generic. This change allows optimized assembler implementations to autoload with module-alias.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new definitions for ATPX in the AMDGPU driver. These definitions include ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only adds new definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a potential deadlock scenario when memory reclaim tries to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items. The patch introduces a new function `check_flush_dependency` that verifies the sanity of the flush dependency and triggers a warning if the conditions are not met.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a potential issue that could lead to a deadlock. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the FPU type for ColdFire MMU platforms. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to memory corruption or other issues, it addresses a real and critical problem. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `handle_IRQ` with `handle_domain_irq` in the `sa1100_handle_irq` function. This change is aimed at automatically mapping the hardware IRQ number to a virtual IRQ (virq).

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the Intel D525MW mainboard. The patch adds a DMI entry to quirk away the phantom LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) header on this mainboard.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a bug reported in the bug tracker (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65256). This indicates that there is a real issue that needs to be fixed.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues. However, it is possible that the presence of a phantom LVDS header on the mainboard could cause confusion or misconfiguration, leading to unexpected behavior or issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It adds a new DMI entry and a callback function to handle the specific issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, further review and testing by the Linux kernel maintainers would be necessary to ensure its correctness and compatibility with the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the debugging output of the turbostat tool less verbose. The patch modifies the `dump_cnt` function to only print the counters that are active, rather than printing all counters regardless of their value.

While this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, it does improve the usability and readability of the tool by reducing unnecessary output. However, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only affects the verbosity of the debugging output.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the firmware UCODE_ID_STORAGE in the Tonga's virtualization environment. It explains that there is no actual firmware data, but a buffer object (BO) still needs to be allocated and its memory controller (mc) address needs to be provided to the hardware (HW) to avoid hanging on virtual functions (VFs).

The v2 of the patch fixes a coding style issue, which improves the overall quality of the code.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

The code changes in the patch modify the logic for setting the maximum number of ucodes based on the firmware load type and whether the device is in SR-IOV mode. This ensures that the correct number of ucodes is set for different scenarios.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue and provides a necessary fix to prevent hangs in the Tonga's virtualization environment. It does not contain any trivial changes and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the ftgmac100 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc, addressing a potential corruption issue by shifting struct page pointers out to their own member in struct ftgmac100.

The patch introduces changes to the ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page and ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page functions, as well as the ftgmac100_rx_packet and ftgmac100_free_buffers functions. These changes ensure that the rx page storage is properly handled and prevent potential issues related to accessing and freeing the pages.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of the return value of seq_printf and converts it to check seq_has_overflowed instead. This change is necessary because seq_printf will soon be changed to return void.

2. The patch modifies the smi_ipmb_proc_show function in the ipmi_msghandler.c file. It replaces the return statement with seq_putc(m, '\n') and then returns seq_has_overflowed(m). This change ensures that the function checks for overflow after writing the newline character.

3. The patch also modifies the smi_version_proc_show function in the ipmi_msghandler.c file. It replaces the return statement with seq_printf(m, "%u.%u\n") and then returns seq_has_overflowed(m). This change ensures that the function checks for overflow after printing the version information.

4. The patch modifies the smi_type_proc_show function in the ipmi_si_intf.c file. It replaces the return statement with seq_printf(m, "%s\n") and then returns seq_has_overflowed(m). This change ensures that the function checks for overflow after printing the type information.

5. The patch modifies the smi_params_proc_show function in the ipmi_si_intf.c file. It replaces the return statement with seq_printf(m, "%s,%s,0x%lx,rsp=%d,rsi=%d,rsh=%d,irq=%d,ipmb=%d\n") and then returns seq_has_overflowed(m). This change ensures that the function checks for overflow after printing the parameter information.

6. The patch modifies the smi_type_proc_show function in the ipmi_ssif.c file. It replaces the return statement with seq_puts(m, "ssif\n") and then returns seq_has_overflowed(m). This change ensures that the function checks for overflow after printing the type information.

Overall, the patch addresses the use of the return value of seq_printf and replaces it with the appropriate check for overflow using seq_has_overflowed. This change ensures that the code is future-proof and aligns with the upcoming changes in seq_printf. Additionally, the modifications made in the patch do not fall under "trivial" fixes and are relevant to fixing potential issues. Hence, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to debug logs in the Bluetooth subsystem. The issue is that the expected and actual key count values were mixed up in the debug logs. The patch corrects this by swapping the values in the log messages.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause confusion or misinterpretation of debug logs, it can be considered a valid fix. However, it does not seem to fix a critical issue that causes a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the fix does not involve any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue that warrants inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a logical improvement for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the ASoC tas5086 codec driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch modifies the function `tas5086_set_deemph` in the `tas5086.c` file of the ASoC codec driver.
2. It introduces a loop that iterates over the `tas5086_deemph` array to find a match for the `priv->rate` value.
3. If a match is found, the loop breaks and assigns the index `i` to the `val` variable.
4. The `val` variable is then used to update specific bits in the `TAS5086_SYS_CONTROL_1` register using `regmap_update_bits`.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a logical improvement that enhances the de-emphasis sampling rate selection. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this decision is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough analysis may be required to make a final determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing a configuration option related to enabling or disabling DMA (Direct Memory Access) in the addi-data drivers for the comedi subsystem. The patch aims to simplify the code by removing the option and enabling DMA if it is supported by default.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is more of a code cleanup or simplification rather than fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the `comedi_driver_unregister()` function in the staging/comedi/drivers.c file.

2. The change replaces the call to `comedi_dev_from_minor()` with `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver.

3. The purpose of this change is to increment the reference count of the device to prevent it from being removed while it is being checked if it is attached to the driver.

4. After the check, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to device removal while being checked for attachment to the driver. This could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as fixing a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Hence, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a generic compatible string for the "hix5hd2" SoC name, which improves the clarity and compatibility of the ethernet driver.

2. The patch updates the "compatible" property to include the generic ethernet driver names "hisilicon,hix5hd2-gemac" and "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-gemac", along with the version strings "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v1" and "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v2". This ensures that the driver is compatible with different versions of the SoC.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch updates the driver's name to "hisi-gemac" to reflect the generic nature of the driver.

5. The patch includes necessary changes in the driver code to support the new compatible strings and version numbers.

Overall, the patch addresses compatibility issues and improves the clarity of the driver. It does not introduce any trivial changes and appears to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters in the cxgb4 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial change that adds device IDs to the existing list.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the onyx and tas codec drivers to use the `module_i2c_driver()` macro. This change makes the code smaller and simpler, but it does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics in the amdgpu driver. 

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed, whether it falls under the criteria of a real and critical bug, and if it causes any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch reorders the fields in the `struct i915_params` in the `i915_drv.h` file. This change does not introduce any functional changes or fix any bugs directly.

2. The patch removes the `enable_hangcheck` field from the middle of the structure and moves it to the end, after the `invert_brightness` field. This change ensures that there are no holes created in the structure, which can help with memory alignment and potentially improve performance.

3. The patch also moves the `fastboot` field to the end of the structure, after the `enable_pc8` field. Again, this change helps avoid creating holes in the structure.

4. The patch adds a comment indicating that bool fields are left at the end to avoid creating holes. This comment provides clarity and documentation for future developers.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it introduce any new features. However, it does improve the structure layout and alignment, which can have potential performance benefits. Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any regressions, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing an error in the mcb_pci_probe() function where it incorrectly returns zero instead of an error code. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as incorrect behavior or failure to handle errors properly.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could impact the functionality and stability of the system, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a missing register setting in the ASoC rsnd driver. The patch adds the missing OUT register setting for SRC_BUSIF_MODE. The patch also updates the register definitions in rsnd.h and modifies the rsnd_src_set_convert_rate function in src.c to set the OUT register.

Since this patch fixes a missing register setting, it does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that does not have a significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the IS_ERR_OR_NULL macro instead of explicitly checking for NULL and IS_ERR separately. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the nfsd (NFS server) code in the Linux kernel. It introduces reference counting to the nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op function and makes some modifications to the nfsd4_open_downgrade and nfsd4_lock functions.

Based on the provided code changes, it is not immediately clear whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or if it introduces any "oh, that's not good" issues. To make an informed decision, we would need more context about the bug being fixed and the impact it has on the system.

Without additional information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) until further details are provided.
false || This patch is a staticization of local symbols in the `dcp.c` file of the crypto subsystem. It makes the `global_dev` symbol static and also makes the `dcp_dma_unmap`, `dcp_dma_map`, and `dcp_watchdog` functions static.

Based on the provided information, this patch seems to be a trivial fix that only modifies local symbols and functions within the `dcp.c` file. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the local variable 'status' from the function lancer_cmd_get_file_len() in the be_ethtool.c file. The function uses lancer_cmd_read_object() to retrieve the current size of registers for ethtool registers dump. The returned status value is stored in the 'status' variable but is not checked.

The patch argues that the check is unnecessary because the 'data_read' output variable is initialized to 0, and the 'status' variable can be removed. This implies that the 'status' variable is not used elsewhere in the function or its removal does not affect the behavior of the code.

Since the 'status' variable is not used and the check is unnecessary, removing it simplifies the code and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, the patch can be considered a non-trivial fix that improves code readability without affecting functionality.

Hence, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that adds the 'const' qualifier to the 'data' parameter in the 'fsnotify' function and related function declarations. This change ensures that the 'data' parameter is treated as read-only within the function, preventing accidental modification.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a bug related to the blackfin architecture's clock driver. It specifically addresses the issue of clk_round_rate() returning a negative error code instead of 0 upon an error.

2. The rationale for the change is explained in the patch description. The return type of clk_round_rate() is being changed to an unsigned type to accommodate clock sources that can generate rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.

3. The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The actual code changes in the patch are straightforward. The variable "ret" in clk_round_rate() is changed from -EIO (a negative error code) to 0.

5. The change does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects some kerneldoc typos and adjusts the function declaration for consistency. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains spelling changes and whitespace cleanups, which are considered trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces open-coded SPI transfer with the spi_sync_transfer() helper function. This change makes the code shorter but does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The change replaces the variable `mute_led_nid` with `cap_mute_led_nid` in the `alc269_fixup_hp_cap_mic_mute_hook` function.

Since this patch only involves a spelling correction and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that turns off the voltage for thermistors when the ADC conversion is initiated. This change is aimed at saving power. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the iio: pressure: mpl3115 driver. The driver was checking for direct mode but not locking it, which could lead to issues during raw reads. The patch introduces the use of claim/release helper functions to ensure that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads.

The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They directly address a potential issue that could cause data corruption or other problems.

The patch includes proper error handling and returns appropriate error codes when necessary. It also includes necessary locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup of error codes in the hv.c file in the staging directory. The patch changes the return values from -1 to specific error codes, such as -EMSGSIZE and -ENOMEM.

Since this patch only involves error code cleanup and does not fix any real and critical bugs, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue of dropped characters at close in the sierra USB serial driver. The patch adds the implementation of the `sierra_chars_in_buffer` function, which calculates the number of characters in the buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBS (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue of dropped characters, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the visibility of a structure declaration. The change from "struct snd_soc_aux_dev rx51_aux_dev[]" to "static struct snd_soc_aux_dev rx51_aux_dev[]" suggests that the intention is to limit the visibility of the "rx51_aux_dev" structure to the current file.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

2. It introduces a new macro `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the number of intervals.

3. The `INTERVALS` macro is modified to use the `INTERVAL_SHIFT` macro instead of a hardcoded value.

4. In the `get_typical_interval` function, the calculation of the average is modified. If the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`, a right shift is performed on the average instead of using `do_div`. Otherwise, the `do_div` function is used as before.

5. Similarly, the calculation of the standard deviation is modified to perform a right shift if the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be an optimization to improve the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "uprobes/x86: Don't change the task's state if ->pre_xol() fails". This suggests that it aims to fix a specific issue related to uprobes on x86 architecture.

2. The patch description mentions that currently, the only ->pre_xol() hook cannot fail, but the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function needs to be fixed regardless. This indicates that there is a potential issue with the current implementation.

3. The patch introduces a check for the presence of the ->pre_xol() hook. If it exists, the hook is called, and if it returns an error, the error is returned from the function.

4. After the ->pre_xol() hook is called (if present), the patch sets the instruction pointer (ip) in the pt_regs structure to the xol_vaddr value from the uprobe_task structure.

5. The patch also updates the trap_nr value in the current thread's context to UPROBE_TRAP_NR, and clears the TIF_BLOCKSTEP flag if it is set.

6. Finally, the patch removes the redundant call to ->pre_xol() that was present before the changes made in the patch.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to uprobes on x86 architecture. It introduces a necessary fix to the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function and ensures that the task's state is not changed if the ->pre_xol() hook fails. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver. Instead, it suggests determining the value of 'ai_continuous' from the cmd->stop_src member.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the 'ai_continuous' member is no longer being used or referenced anywhere in the driver. The patch also introduces a new variable 'cmd' to access the cmd structure from the async structure.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the removal of 'ai_continuous' does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the removal of 'ai_continuous' can be considered a trivial fix as it does not impact the functionality or stability of the driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the libcfs_ioctl() prototype in the staging/lustre code. The patch changes the second argument of the libcfs_ioctl() function from "void *arg" to "void __user *arg". 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch seems to be fixing a prototype mismatch in the libcfs_ioctl() function. While this is a valid fix, it does not address any real and critical bug or issue that falls under the criteria mentioned earlier. It appears to be a trivial fix related to function signature alignment.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces no functional changes or fixes any critical bugs. The patch only introduces a local variable `ops` to store the `rdev->desc->ops` value and uses it in subsequent code blocks.

Since the patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only contains a trivial fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is not addressing any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the powergating logic in the AMDGPU driver for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU family. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code" and mentions fixing up the powergating logic. This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to power management for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block on CI GPUs.

2. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from Rex Zhu and an ack-by line from Tom St Denis, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch. Additionally, it has a reviewed-by line from Alex Deucher, further indicating that the patch has undergone review.

3. The patch modifies the `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` function in the `ci_dpm.c` file. It adds conditional logic to gate or ungate the UVD block based on the `gate` parameter.

4. Inside the conditional logic, the patch calls `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` to set the powergating state of the UVD block. If `gate` is true, it sets the state to AMD_PG_STATE_GATE, and if `gate` is false, it sets the state to AMD_PG_STATE_UNGATE.

5. After setting the powergating state, the patch calls `ci_update_uvd_dpm` to update the UVD DPM (Dynamic Power Management) based on the `gate` parameter.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to powergating the UVD block on CI GPUs. It introduces conditional logic to properly gate or ungate the UVD block and updates the UVD DPM accordingly. Since this patch fixes a real and critical bug that affects the power management of a hardware block, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a function in the rtl8192e driver. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function "add_pcie_port" to "dra7xx_add_pcie_port" in the PCI driver for the dra7xx platform. This change is made to avoid potential naming collisions in the global namespace.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and it only involves a trivial renaming, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new feature to the DRM Radeon driver for the Cayman GPU. The patch implements the ability to force a performance level via sysfs. 

While this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it does introduce a new functionality that could be considered useful for certain users. However, it is important to note that this patch does not seem to fix any critical bug or address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug and can be considered a "trivial" addition rather than a fix for a significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for encoding the `flags` field in the `ceph_osd_op` structure. The patch adds the `flags` field to the `struct ceph_osd_req_op` and updates the `flags` field in the `struct ceph_osd_op` to `CEPH_OSD_OP_FLAG_*`. It also includes the necessary changes in the `osd_req_encode_op` function to encode the `flags` field.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to encoding the `flags` field and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the necessary Kconfig entry to enable the MODULE_TX28 configuration option. This option selects various platform-specific features, including MXS_HAVE_PLATFORM_MXS_MMC. This indicates that the patch is adding support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform.

2. In the mach-tx28.c file, the patch adds a static struct mxs_mmc_platform_data named tx28_mmc0_pdata. This structure contains platform-specific data for the MXS MMC device, such as the write-protect GPIO pin and the supported capabilities.

3. The patch modifies the tx28_stk5v3_init function to call mx28_add_mxs_mmc with the appropriate arguments, including the newly defined tx28_mmc0_pdata structure. This function initializes the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. However, without further information about the criticality of this bug fix or any potential issues it addresses, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision (ACK or NAK) based solely on the provided information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the MIPS PNX8550 platform. The warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization data annotation for the `arcs_cmdline` variable in the `prom_getcmdline()` function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It addresses a section mismatch warning, which is not a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch contains a trivial fix by adding the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function. While this is a necessary fix, it falls under the category of a "trivial" change, as it does not address a critical bug.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: "Staging: hv: Properly handle the error in hv_acpi_init()"
   The title suggests that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - K. Y. Srinivasan <kys@microsoft.com>
   - Haiyang Zhang <haiyangz@microsoft.com>
   - Hank Janssen <hjanssen@microsoft.com>
   - Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

   These lines indicate the authors and contributors of the patch.

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the hv_acpi_init() function in the vmbus_drv.c file.

   - Line 788: The patch adds error handling code after calling vmbus_bus_init(irq).
     If vmbus_bus_init() returns a non-zero value (indicating an error), the patch unregisters the vmbus_acpi_driver using acpi_bus_unregister_driver() and returns the error code.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function. It properly handles the error by unregistering the vmbus_acpi_driver in case of an error during vmbus_bus_init(). This fix is not a trivial change and could potentially prevent issues such as hangs or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file of the hwmon subsystem. The patch modifies some macros for consistency and to improve code readability.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it only addresses smatch warnings, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `list_tail_entry()` with `list_last_entry()` in `mm/zbud.c`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a vifs list to the wl12xx driver in the Linux kernel. This list is used to keep track of all the virtual interfaces associated with the hardware. 

The patch includes modifications to the `wl12xx_init_vif_data`, `wl1271_op_add_interface`, `__wl1271_op_remove_interface`, and `wl1271_alloc_hw` functions in the `main.c` file, as well as modifications to the `wl12xx_vif` structure in the `wl12xx.h` file.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be adding a feature or improving the code structure by introducing a vifs list. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Based on the given information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the clock data for OMAP4. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the greybus interface. The patch addresses the immediate deactivation of an interface on enumeration failure, which can help prevent further issues or potential crashes.

The patch also includes error handling code to handle failures during interface activation and enabling. It logs error messages and takes appropriate actions to deactivate the interface and add it to the greybus interface list.

Since the patch addresses a potential issue that can lead to errors or instability, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only corrects the mask defines for certain registers in the WM8900 codec driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the ti_abb_init_table() function in the ti-abb-regulator.c file. The patch propagates the error value returned by the function instead of hardcoding a specific error code.

Since this patch addresses a real bug and improves error handling, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the usage of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function of the `ux500_pcm.c` file. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a cleanup change rather than a fix for a problematic behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `spin_lock_init()` function call after the error checking for the `kmalloc()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the stability or security of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` and `pr_info` with `dev_err` and `dev_info` respectively. This change is made to provide more accurate log messages with the device name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the function `clk_get()` to `devm_clk_get()` in the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function. This change suggests that the patch is replacing the manual handling of the clock resource with a managed version, which is generally considered a good practice. This change does not appear to be a trivial fix.

2. The patch removes the `clk_put()` call in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the clock resource is no longer manually released, which could potentially lead to a resource leak. However, it is important to note that this change might be intentional if the clock resource is managed by the device model. Further analysis is required to determine if this change is correct.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is not a trivial fix and it introduces a change that could potentially have an impact on resource management. However, without more context and understanding of the specific hardware and driver implementation, it is difficult to determine the correctness of the patch.

Therefore, I would recommend further review and testing by the appropriate maintainers and experts in the relevant subsystem before accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This is done because these functions are not used outside of this file. 

Additionally, the patch eliminates the warning messages related to missing prototypes for these functions. 

Since the patch fixes a warning and makes the code more maintainable by marking unused functions as static, it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to optimize ring count validations in the qlcnic driver. It introduces two changes:

1. It checks the interrupt mode at the start of qlcnic_set_channels() and returns an error if the adapter does not support MSI-X mode. This is a valid check to ensure that the required features are available for the subsequent operations.

2. It avoids validating the ring count if it is not going to change. This optimization can save unnecessary processing time and improve performance.

Both changes seem reasonable and do not fall into the category of trivial fixes. They address potential issues related to interrupt mode and unnecessary validations.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the bcm_sf2 driver in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description explains that during the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use b53_common, a small piece was left untouched where the local copy of the per-port port_vlan_ctl bitmask value was kept. This local copy is now stale, and the patch aims to use the value maintained by b53_device instead.

2. The "Fixes" tag references a specific commit (f458995b9ad8) that introduced the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to utilize the core B53 driver when possible. This indicates that the patch is addressing an issue introduced by that commit.

3. The patch modifies the bcm_sf2_port_setup function in the bcm_sf2.c file. Specifically, it replaces the usage of `priv->port_sts[port].vlan_ctl_mask` with `priv->dev->ports[port].vlan_ctl_mask` when setting the `reg` value.

4. The bcm_sf2.h file is also modified, but the changes are unrelated to the issue being fixed. They involve removing the `u16 vlan_ctl_mask` field from the `struct bcm_sf2_port_status`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug introduced during the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver. It fixes a potential issue with the port_vlan_ctl bitmask value, ensuring that the correct value is used from the b53_device structure. Since this bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption, it meets the criteria for a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a memory leak issue in the docg3 driver.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the error handling path in the `doc_probe_device` function.

3. In the original code, if the `chip_id` is not equal to its inverse, the code jumps to the `nomem3` label, which leads to memory deallocation and returning from the function.

4. The patch changes the `goto nomem3` statement to `goto nomem4` in two places.

5. The `nomem4` label is added, and it frees the `docg3->bbt` memory before jumping to `nomem3`.

6. The `nomem3` label remains unchanged and frees the `mtd` memory.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a memory leak issue by properly freeing the `docg3->bbt` memory before deallocating the `mtd` memory. This fix addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p_jpeg_device_run and s5p_jpeg_runtime_resume callbacks. These callbacks alter device registers, which makes it critical to have spin_lock protection to prevent potential issues such as data corruption or race conditions.

The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to protect the critical sections of code. This ensures that the device registers are accessed safely and avoids potential issues.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces "x != NULL" with "x". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the missing OF module alias information for the ppc4xx_edac platform driver. This fix enables module autoloading for the driver.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and evaluate if it meets the criteria for inclusion.

The patch appears to be related to the be2iscsi driver in the SCSI subsystem. It includes changes to the initialization and posting of Scatter-Gather Lists (SGL) and pages for the Dual Chute feature. The patch also includes modifications to the initialization of the SGL handle.

Upon analyzing the code changes, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the initialization and handling of SGLs and pages for the Dual Chute feature. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional details such as whether this patch fixes a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. We would also need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without this additional information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the nau8825 codec. The patch aims to improve the jack connection decision logic by considering both active low and active high jack insertion scenarios.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to address a potential issue with the original design that only covers the active low jack insertion logic. By introducing additional conditions, the patch aims to handle both active low and active high jack insertion scenarios.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it appears to be an improvement to the existing functionality.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the regulator_ops structure for the mc13892_sw_regulator_ops. The change involves adding the map_voltage function to the structure.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding a flag to indicate whether a device supports runtime PM (Power Management) for the sdhci-pci driver in the Linux kernel. The flag is added to the `struct sdhci_pci_fixes` and `struct sdhci_pci_chip` structures, and it is used to determine whether to allow runtime PM for the device during probe and remove operations.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the given criteria, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the `gen8_gt_irq_handler` function in `i915_irq.c` file.
2. It adds support for handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring (`VCS2`) in addition to the first BSD ring (`VCS`).
3. The patch checks if the `GEN8_GT_VCS1_IRQ` or `GEN8_GT_VCS2_IRQ` bits are set in the `master_ctl` variable.
4. If either of the bits is set, it reads the interrupt status from the corresponding register (`GEN8_GT_IIR(1)`).
5. If the interrupt status is non-zero, it handles the interrupt by notifying the respective ring (`VCS` or `VCS2`) using the `notify_ring` function.
6. Finally, it clears the interrupt status by writing back the read value to the register.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug by adding support for handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functionality and addresses a potential issue with handling interrupts for the second BSD ring.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an uninitialized return variable in the function `request_code_segment()` in the `ft1000_download.c` file of the `ft1000` staging driver.

2. Problem:
   The return variable `status` is used uninitialized if the argument `boot_case` is false.

3. Solution:
   The patch initializes the `status` variable by assigning the return value of the `write_blk_fifo()` function.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential bug where the `status` variable is used uninitialized. This bug could lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect results if the `boot_case` argument is false. By initializing the `status` variable with the return value of `write_blk_fifo()`, the patch ensures that the variable is properly set.

5. Impact:
   This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior, but it does not fall into the category of "real and critical" bugs.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix since it does not address a critical bug. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the clock ID for the "pclk_isp_in" clock in the Rockchip RK3288 clock driver. The change replaces the existing code with a new code that uses the macro "PCLK_ISP_IN" instead of a hard-coded value.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the allocation of requests in the blk-mq-sched module. The patch checks for successful allocation before assigning a tag to the request.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a defensive programming improvement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the naming for the "micd-timeout" property in the extcon-arizona device tree binding documentation. It adds the time units of -ms (milliseconds) to the property name. This change improves clarity and consistency in the documentation.

2. The patch also updates the code in the extcon-arizona driver to read the "micd-timeout-ms" property instead of the previous "micd-timeout" property. This ensures that the timeout value for microphone detection is specified in milliseconds.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves documentation and code consistency. It does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed off by xiangxiao <xiaoxiang@xiaomi.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@linaro.org>.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the function `snd_soc_jack_add_gpios` in the file `sound/soc/soc-jack.c`.

4. Code analysis: The patch introduces a change in the code where the initial jack status update is delayed using `schedule_delayed_work` function. The delay is set to `gpios[i].debounce_time` using `msecs_to_jiffies` function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is introducing a necessary delay in the initial jack detection process to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. This delay can help prevent potential issues such as false jack detection or incorrect initialization.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to hardware initialization and debounce, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a redundant definition for `pgprot_writecombine`. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that hardcodes the clock event rating to 125 for the CMT driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `snd_array_new` in the file `sound/pci/hda/hda_codec.c`. The purpose of this function is to allocate memory for an array and initialize it.

The patch removes the explicit `memset` call that initializes the newly allocated memory with zeros. Instead, it uses the `__GFP_ZERO` flag in the `krealloc` function to allocate and zero-initialize the memory in a single step.

The change improves code readability and reduces the chance of errors related to incorrect memory initialization. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs, but it is a valid improvement that falls within the acceptable criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to microcode handling for AMD processors. The patch reads the CPUID(1).EAX leaf at the correct CPU and uses it to search for a matching microcode patch in an equivalence table. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to missing return statements in the nl802154_add_llsec_key() function. The patch adds a missing return statement to handle the case where certain attributes are not present, returning -EINVAL.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used in the msi-available-ranges property. The patch modifies the code in the fsl_msi_setup_hwirq() and fsl_of_msi_probe() functions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the platform name from "omap-pcm-audio" to "omap-mcbsp.2" in the n810_dai structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a simple renaming of the platform name.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the WM8958 detection mode changes in the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the wm8994 codec. 

The patch includes two changes:
1. Line 3330: It adds a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` after forcing the enablement of the "CLK_SYS" pin. This ensures that the DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) framework is synchronized after the pin is enabled.
2. Line 3376: It adds a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` after disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin. This ensures that the DAPM framework is synchronized after the pin is disabled.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it is not clear if the changes introduced by the patch are non-trivial.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue this patch aims to address and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Without this information, I cannot determine whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a sparse warning in the cx25821 driver. The warning is related to an incorrect type in argument 2, specifically different address spaces. 

However, this patch seems to be a trivial fix as it only addresses a warning and does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing function call. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to modify the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq` from `unsigned int` to `int`. The reason for this change is that the function may eventually return a negative error code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix related to the return type of a function.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming two functions in the powerpc/ps3 code.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for reporting whether the interrupt was handled or not in the tda998x driver. The patch introduces a new variable "handled" and sets it to false initially. If certain conditions are met, such as finding nothing to do or a change in HPD (Hot Plug Detect), the "handled" variable is set to true. Finally, the return value of the interrupt handler is set to IRQ_RETVAL(handled), which will return IRQ_NONE if "handled" is false.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause the kernel to lock up, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the dma-range size when the DT attribute is missing. It sets the size to dev->coherent_dma_mask + 1 instead of dev->coherent_dma_mask. This ensures that the correct size is used when the DT attribute is not present.

2. The patch also adds code to check for invalid values of size configured in DT and logs an error if an invalid size is found. This helps in identifying and handling invalid configurations.

3. The patch includes a Tested-by tag from Suravee Suthikulpanit, indicating that it has been tested successfully by the mentioned individual.

4. The patch includes Signed-off-by tags from Murali Karicheri and Bjorn Helgaas, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch includes an Acked-by tag from Will Deacon, indicating that they have acknowledged and approved the patch.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `dev_{get|set}_drvdata` with `spi_{get|set}_drvdata` in the `mrf24j40` driver. This change allows for direct passing of the `struct spi_device` instead of using `&spi->dev`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a NULL comparison style in the code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the MODULE_VERSION macro from the carl9170 driver in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of a cleanup or cosmetic change.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a bypass mode for vce3.0 in the AMDGPU driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a new function called `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` which is responsible for setting the bypass mode for vce3.0. This function takes an `adev` parameter (representing the AMDGPU device) and a boolean `enable` parameter.

2. Inside the `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function, it reads the current value of `GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `RREG32_SMC` macro and stores it in the `tmp` variable.

3. If `enable` is true, it sets the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit in `tmp` using the bitwise OR operation. Otherwise, it clears the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit using the bitwise AND operation.

4. Finally, it writes the modified `tmp` value back to the `ixGCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `WREG32_SMC` macro.

5. The patch also modifies the `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function to call `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` if the `adev`'s `asic_type` is `CHIP_POLARIS10`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds a necessary functionality to enable bypass mode for vce3.0 on the AMDGPU driver. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision based solely on the provided information. To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue this patch aims to fix and its impact on the system's stability, security, or functionality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to initializing the "tokens" and "ctokens" variables correctly in the htb_change_class function in the sch_htb.c file. The patch converts the values from ticks to nanoseconds using the PSCHED_TICKS2NS macro.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, we need to assess if the bug being fixed is real and critical. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug. However, if the incorrect initialization of "tokens" and "ctokens" could lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the HTB queuing discipline, it could be considered a critical bug.

Next, we need to check if the patch addresses any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant problems. From the provided patch, it seems to address a potential issue with incorrect initialization, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability. This could be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Lastly, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. From the provided patch, it seems to be addressing a real issue rather than a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it is confirmed that the bug being fixed is critical and the patch effectively addresses the issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a compilation warning related to 32-bit builds. The change involves casting a variable to `(unsigned long)` before assigning it to `(u64)`. This type of fix falls under the category of a "trivial" change, as it does not address a real and critical bug or issue.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference error in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds a NULL check for the 'match' variable before using it. 

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch converts the control and DAPM initialization in the ASoC wm8940 codec to a table-based approach. This can improve code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch includes changes to the DAPM widgets and routes for the wm8940 codec. It replaces the existing audio_map with wm8940_dapm_routes.

3. The patch removes the wm8940_add_widgets function, which was responsible for adding DAPM widgets and routes. This function is no longer needed since the initialization is now table-based.

4. The patch modifies the soc_codec_dev_wm8940 structure to include the new control and DAPM table definitions.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not appear to fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a code refactoring and improvement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "funcs" argument in two functions: drm_fb_cma_alloc() and drm_fbdev_cma_create_with_funcs(). 

Since this patch only adds the "const" qualifier to function arguments, it does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve existing functionality.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real issue related to freeing sk_buffs under RTNL protection, which can cause TX/RX freezes and latency spikes. The patch introduces the ability to defer skb freeing by adding the rtnl_kfree_skbs() function and modifies the qdisc_reset_queue() and __qdisc_reset_queue() functions to handle the new behavior.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause performance issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to properly starting and stopping the phy device in the mv643xx_eth driver. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, it addresses a real and critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on the bug fix.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only replaces a couple of lines of code with a helper function, which calculates a multiplier value from wMaxPacketSize. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for cleaning up coding style issues in the clk-bcm2835.c file. The changes include removing the license text, modifying comments, and fixing indentation.

Since the patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and only focuses on coding style improvements, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a code style warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch only replaces the usage of `call->conn->params.peer` with `call->peer` in multiple places. This change seems to be a code cleanup rather than fixing any significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a constant from "RSND_GEN2_SRU" to "RSND_GEN2_SCU" in the rcar_snd.h header file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity or consistency purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the `fs/proc/kcore.c` file in the Linux kernel. The patch replaces the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy` for copying the `saved_command_line` string into `prpsinfo.pr_psargs`.

The `strncpy` function is known to be error-prone as it does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string if the source string is longer than the specified length. On the other hand, `strlcpy` is a safer alternative that ensures null-termination of the destination string.

Considering the patch's purpose is to fix a potential issue with null-termination, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a struct and associated variable names. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves aesthetics by using the comedi_buf_write_samples() function instead of directly calling comedi_buf_put(). However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to select only devices with active links when looking for or validating a user device in the staging/rdma/hfi1 driver.

2. The patch introduces a new function called `usable_device` that checks if a device is available for general use by verifying if its driver link state is active.

3. In the `get_user_context` function, the patch adds a check using the `usable_device` function to filter out devices that are not currently active. This ensures that only devices with active links are considered for user context allocation.

4. Similarly, in the `find_shared_ctxt` function, the patch removes the check for device usability and relies on the `usable_device` function to filter out inactive devices.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue by selecting only devices with active links for user device operations. It improves the stability and reliability of the driver by avoiding potential issues with inactive devices.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that exports the `ioremap_nocache` function in the CRIS architecture.

   - The patch aims to remove an unnecessary cast on a void pointer in the rtl8712 staging driver.

2. Coccinelle script:
   - The patch includes a Coccinelle script that was used to detect the unnecessary cast on a void pointer.

3. Code changes:
   - The patch modifies the r8712_xmit_bh() function in the rtl8712/usb_ops_linux.c file.
   - It replaces the cast on the 'priv' parameter from "(struct _adapter *)" to "struct _adapter *".

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing an unnecessary cast on a void pointer. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, the change does not appear to introduce any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc).

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that makes the function `lp8727_ctrl_switch()` inline. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a debug entry for GCA configuration data in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes changes to the amdgpu_device.c file, adding a new debugfs file operation for reading the GCA configuration data.

Upon analyzing the patch, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new debug feature to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of v4l2_ctrl_handler freeing and v4l2_device unregistration in the em28xx-v4l extension. The patch ensures that these functions are called whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a cleanup or improvement rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for fast-xmit in the ath9k driver. However, without further information about the nature of this feature and its impact on the system, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the fast-xmit feature, such as its purpose, potential benefits, and any associated risks or issues. Additionally, I would need to assess whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug, or if it falls into the category of a "trivial" fix.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether the patch should be accepted or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the declaration of the function `release_uids` is being removed from `sched.h` because there is no actual implementation of this function. The patch also includes the Acked-by and Signed-off-by tags from Serge Hallyn and Eric W. Biederman respectively.

Since the patch is removing a declaration for a non-existent function, it does not fix any real bug or issue. Additionally, it does not address any critical problem such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix, specifically a cleanup of unnecessary code.

According to the given criteria, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the behavior when `master->transfer_one` returns a positive value by setting `ret` to 0 and waiting for completion. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the alignment of auxtrace data in the perf tools. The patch allows the auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size, which is necessary for certain scenarios like BTS where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing trace statement in the ext4_ext_map_blocks() function. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding two new system calls, sched_setattr and sched_getattr, to the microblaze architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch description does not provide any information about the purpose or significance of these new system calls.

Without further context or explanation, it is difficult to determine if these system calls address any critical bugs, security issues, or other significant problems. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not seem to address any immediate critical issues.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the deprecated IRQF_DISABLED flag from the nokia-modem.c driver in the HSI subsystem. The patch itself states that the flag has been a NOOP since 2.6.35 and will be removed soon.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue. The patch allows X.509 certificates to be blacklisted based on their TBSCertificate hash. While this feature may be convenient and align with UEFI's blacklist, it does not address any of the specified criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the deletion of the AP station in the iwlwifi driver. The patch modifies the behavior of deleting the station by marking it as unused instead of directly deleting it. This change aims to prevent confusion and potential issues when the device expects the station to be present while the associated bit is set.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific behavior change related to station deletion.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding accessor functions for the GCR_L2_CONFIG register in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds register accessors.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that marks the function `dwc_dump_chan_regs` as inline. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch is titled "[SCSI] qla2xxx: No fcport FC-4 type assignment in GA_NXT response." It suggests that there is an issue with the fcport FC-4 type assignment in the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by three individuals, Armen Baloyan, Saurav Kashyap, and James Bottomley. This indicates that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the qla2x00_ga_nxt() function in the qla_gs.c file.

4. Code analysis: The patch adds a new line of code that assigns the fc4_type of the fcport based on the value of the fc4_types array in the ct_rsp structure. If the third element of the array has its first bit set, the fc4_type is assigned as FC4_TYPE_FCP_SCSI; otherwise, it is assigned as FC4_TYPE_OTHER.

5. Impact analysis: The patch addresses the issue of missing fcport FC-4 type assignment in the GA_NXT response. This could potentially lead to incorrect handling of the fcport and impact the functionality of the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. It addresses an issue that could potentially cause incorrect handling of the fcport FC-4 type assignment. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the file `net/ipv6/ip6_output.c` and replaces the `BUG()` macro with `BUG_ON()` in the `ip6_fragment()` function. The `BUG()` macro is used to trigger a kernel panic when a condition is met, indicating a critical bug.

The change replaces the `BUG()` call with `BUG_ON()`, which is a more modern and preferred way of expressing the same behavior. The `BUG_ON()` macro also triggers a kernel panic when the condition is met, but it provides additional information about the condition that caused the panic.

The change itself does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves replacing a macro and potentially improving the debugging capabilities of the code. It does not appear to be a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Given that the patch replaces a critical bug detection mechanism with a more modern and informative one, it can be considered a valid fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the `dvb_unregister_device()` function. Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

Given that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather removes a trivial check, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to clean up the code by moving release handles into fail labels. This is a code organization improvement and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

3. The changes made in the patch are trivial and do not involve any functional changes or bug fixes.

Based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the TWL6030 MFD (Multi-Function Device) driver by implementing the irq_set_wake() function. This function allows TWL6030 client drivers to make use of irq_wake() for waking up the application processor on specific IRQ events.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT on the read syscall path. This check is causing issues with the standard way of reading counters, which is to open the counter, wait for the monitored process to die, and then read the counter.

2. The patch has been reported by Stephane Eranian and signed-off by Jiri Olsa, both of whom are reputable contributors to the Linux kernel.

3. The patch has also been acknowledged by Stephane Eranian and Peter Zijlstra, further validating its importance.

4. The patch includes relevant Cc's to individuals who are involved in kernel development and performance monitoring.

5. The patch provides a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list for reference.

6. The change in the patch is minimal and focused on reverting the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT, which is causing issues. It does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to performance monitoring and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the hfi1_query_qp function is being removed from the staging/rdma/hfi1/qp.c file. The function is then no longer being used in the codebase.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a removal of a function that is no longer used.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a code cleanup or removal of unused code. As per the criteria, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to prevent accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it has been reset. This issue occurs when the kernel reboots, and the buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler. The proposed solution is to avoid updating the buffer tail if it has been reset.

2. Impact:
   The patch addresses a potential issue where accessing the tty circular buffer after it has been reset could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

3. Bug Severity:
   It is not explicitly mentioned whether this issue causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug.

4. Code Analysis:
   The patch modifies the `bfin_serial_dma_tx_int` function in the `bfin_uart.c` file. It adds a condition to check if the circular buffer is empty before updating the buffer tail. If the buffer is not empty, the tail is updated as before. This change ensures that the buffer tail is not modified when it has been reset.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. However, assuming the bug is critical and meets the criteria, the patch appears to address the issue correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if the bug is critical and meets the criteria mentioned earlier.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch titled "ARM: i.MX5x clocks: Add EPIT support" adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem. It introduces new clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2, along with corresponding clock registration and clock device registration.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issues. The patch appears to be adding support for a new feature rather than fixing an existing problem.

Therefore, considering the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, it seems that this patch should not be accepted (B) as it does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough examination of the code changes and their impact would be necessary for a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to updating the scan response data in the Bluetooth management code. The patch updates the correct variables, `scan_rsp_data_len` and `scan_rsp_data`, instead of mistakenly using the advertising data variables.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real issue: The original code uses pr_warn to print a warning message when failing to register or reregister to debugfs. The patch replaces pr_warn with netdev_warn, which is a more appropriate function for printing warnings related to network devices.

2. The change does not appear to be trivial: The patch modifies the code logic by replacing pr_warn with netdev_warn. Although it may seem like a simple change, it is not a trivial fix as it involves replacing a generic warning function with a network device-specific warning function.

3. The patch does not introduce any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are considered trivial fixes.

4. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by using the appropriate function for printing warnings related to network devices.

5. The patch does not mention any security issues, but it is not explicitly required for a patch to address a security issue to be accepted in -stable releases.

Based on the above analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the declaration of the "decon_crtc_ops" structure in the "exynos5433_drm_decon.c" file. This change is aimed at improving code correctness by ensuring that the structure is treated as read-only when passed as an argument to the "exynos_drm_crtc_create" function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it only contains a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the `mask_pos` correctly in the PCI subsystem. The original code incorrectly calculated the value of `mask_pos` based on the `control` and `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` values.

The patch modifies the code to correctly calculate `mask_pos` based on the `control` value. It uses a conditional statement to check if `control` has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set. If it does, `mask_pos` is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, otherwise it is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or issues in the PCI subsystem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial update to the tg3 driver version number and release date. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the `builtin_platform_driver()` helper. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/msm: use drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence." It suggests using the function drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane.

2. Patch Details:
   The patch modifies the msm_atomic_commit() function in the msm_atomic.c file. It adds a call to drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane_state. This change ensures that plane_state->fence is not overwritten if the user has already set an explicit fence.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to setting the fence for the plane_state. It does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. Conclusion:
   Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the usage of a variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code improvement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT (Device Tree) data, which avoids the need to add clock aliases under specific files.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (code improvement), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `efivarfs_file_write()` function in the `efivars.c` file. The patch addresses a sign issue by changing the variable type from `size_t` to `ssize_t`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix related to sign issues.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to newer versions of gcc and variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch addresses the issue by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays directly.

However, the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it fixes. It only refers to three bug reports related to the issue. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the bug being addressed.

Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be related to code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve replacing array indexing with pointer arithmetic, which can improve performance but does not directly address any known issue causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Considering these factors, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not appear to fix a critical bug or address a significant issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to debug information display in the mac80211 module. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" debug information outside the mesh_stats debug group and adds it separately. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to address a sparse warning. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch adds a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, to protect concurrent access to the `free_vbufs` list.
2. The spinlock is initialized in the `virtio_gpu_alloc_vbufs` function.
3. The `virtio_gpu_free_vbufs` function acquires the spinlock before iterating over the `free_vbufs` list and freeing the vbufs.
4. The `virtio_gpu_get_vbuf` function acquires the spinlock before retrieving a vbuf from the `free_vbufs` list.
5. The `free_vbuf` function acquires the spinlock before adding a vbuf to the `free_vbufs` list.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the patch adds necessary locking to protect concurrent access to the `free_vbufs` list in the virtio-gpu driver. This locking ensures that multiple threads or processes cannot access the list simultaneously, preventing potential data corruption or race conditions.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses the non-success return paths where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks in certain scenarios, such as when the card isn't ready or when the card is hardware-rfkilled.

The suggested fix includes deallocating the broadcast stations before returning an error in the __il4965_up() function. This ensures that the memory is properly freed in these error cases.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can cause memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that can lead to resource exhaustion and instability in the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that eliminates the send buffers in the GSI receive QP. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the xenfs filesystem to use kuid and kgid instead of setting the i_uid and i_gid fields directly. This change is made in the xenfs_make_inode function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds code to re-create the graph walk object as needed to ensure it is large enough for all entities in the graph. This is done to support pipeline power management in the future.

2. The patch fixes a documentation bug related to a warning message about a bad line in the graph_mutex.

3. The patch acquires the graph_mutex lock and checks if the current graph walk object is large enough. If not, it initializes a new graph walk object and cleans up the old one.

4. The patch releases the graph_mutex lock and returns 0.

5. The patch also adds a call to media_entity_graph_walk_cleanup() in the media_device_cleanup() function to clean up the pm_count_walk graph walk object.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to graph walk object size and fixes a documentation bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless conditional branch. The change simply assigns the value of `skb` to `napi->skb` without any additional checks. Since `napi->skb` is already NULL, there is no risk of any bad behavior or issues.

Considering that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability and removes unnecessary checks, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "drm/ttm: wait for BO idle after the move in ttm_bo_swapout". This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to waiting for the Buffer Object (BO) to become idle after a move operation in the ttm_bo_swapout function.

2. The patch includes a Reviewed-by tag from Alex Deucher and Signed-off-by tags from Christian König and Alex Deucher. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The patch modifies the ttm_bo_swapout function by removing the initial wait for the GPU and moving the BO to the system cached placement.

4. After the move, the patch introduces a new step to ensure that the BO is idle before proceeding further.

5. The patch also includes necessary error handling and cleanup code.

Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a real and critical issue related to waiting for the BO to become idle after a move operation. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant declarations of functions in the perf/x86/intel/bts driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). The patch description only mentions adding AR9580 support to the ath9k driver, and it includes the necessary changes to the PCI device table.

To make an informed decision, further analysis is required. The patch should be reviewed for any potential build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical bugs that it addresses. Additionally, it should be checked if the patch contains any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are not suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

Please provide more details or the actual code changes in the patch for a thorough analysis.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: staging: comedi: pcl816: remove 'i8254_osc_base' from boardinfo
   - The patch aims to remove the 'i8254_osc_base' data from the boardinfo structure in the pcl816 driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the struct pcl816_board definition.
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the boardtypes[] array for the "pcl816" and "pcl814b" board types.
   - The i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function calls are modified to use the constant I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ instead of the board->i8254_osc_base value.

3. Analysis:
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the boardinfo structure, indicating that it is not required for the driver's functionality.
   - The removal of the 'i8254_osc_base' field does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.
   - The changes made in the i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function calls ensure that the constant I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ is used instead of the board-specific value. This change does not introduce any critical issues.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a trivial cleanup that removes an unnecessary field and updates the code to use a constant value instead. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this decision is based on the provided information and analysis. If there are any additional factors or considerations, they should be taken into account before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a wait for one vblank before disabling CRCs in the i915 driver. The purpose of this change is to avoid a spurious interrupt warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new member `resource` to the `struct drbd_device` in the `drbd_int.h` header file. This member is then assigned a value in the `drbd_create_minor` function in `drbd_main.c` and used in the `drbd_adm_prepare` function in `drbd_nl.c`.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds a new member to a structure, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the svcrpc module related to the traversal of the xpt_list during shutdown. The patch introduces locking using the sv_lock spinlock to ensure proper synchronization.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a locking issue that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior during shutdown.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. It also does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only factors out a function and does not address any critical issues. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of the `led_info` structure in the `leds-pca963x.c` file. The patch initializes the `led` structure completely by using the `{}` initializer, which ensures that all fields are properly initialized.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to uninitialized data and unpredictable behavior, it can be considered a valid fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a helper function called `dwc3_core_fifo_space` to the `dwc3` USB driver. This helper function is used to retrieve the available space in different queues and FIFOs in the `dwc3` controller. The purpose of this helper function is to facilitate debugging and potentially enable remote wakeup for starting a transfer when there is data in a TX FIFO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? No, this patch does not seem to fix a bug. It adds a helper function for debugging and potential future use.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? No, this patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? No, this patch does not address any security concerns.

4. Does it address an "oh, that's not good" issue? No, this patch does not seem to address any problematic behavior.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential security issue. The patch reintroduces a check to disallow world-writable files in sysfs. This check was previously removed when the check was unified into VERIFY_OCTAL_PERMISSIONS().

Considering that the patch addresses a real security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a semicolon. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of incorrect clock limits for sdvo and lvds in the gma500 driver. It corrects the values of n, m1, and m2 by subtracting 2 before writing them to the FP register. The patch also updates the minimum and maximum values for n, m1, and m2.

The changes in the patch appear to fix a real issue related to clock calculations, which can potentially lead to incorrect display behavior or other related problems. It does not seem to be a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch only changes the return type of the `drm_pci_agp_init` function from `int` to `void`. This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch addresses the issue of freeing nf_bridge information after POST_ROUTING, as it is only needed for -m physdev. This change ensures that the allocation and free operations typically happen on the same CPU.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than fixing a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the Lustre staging driver. It does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix warnings related to pointer-to-integer casts and pointer alignment in the spi-pxa2xx driver. These warnings are seen when compiling a 64-bit kernel.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses warnings that do not directly impact the functionality or stability of the kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or warnings fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to make use of the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of hardcoding it to the bit used by current Tegra GPUs. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific hardware configuration issue.

2. The patch adds a new member, "iommu_bit," to the "gk20a_instmem" structure. This member will store the IOMMU bit value.

3. In the "gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to clear the IOMMU bit to unmap pages. Instead of hardcoding the bit number, it now uses the "iommu_bit" member from the "gk20a_instmem" structure.

4. Similarly, in the "gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to set the IOMMU bit to resolve addresses through the IOMMU. Again, it uses the "iommu_bit" member from the "gk20a_instmem" structure.

5. Finally, in the "gk20a_instmem_new" function, the patch assigns the "iommu_bit" value from the platform data to the "iommu_bit" member of the "gk20a_instmem" structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is addressing a specific hardware configuration issue related to the IOMMU bit. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that replaces the module_init and module_exit calls with the module_i2c_driver macro. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the explicit initialization and cleanup functions.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function callback. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unused code), I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a new function, `nvme_free_queue_mem()`, which is called in the case of initialization failure to free the memory allocated for the admin queue. This ensures that the memory is properly released even if the initialization fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential memory leak, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the function `blkdev_mmap()` as static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the cfg80211 module. The patch allows vendor commands that require the WIPHY_VENDOR_CMD_NEED_RUNNING flag to be sent to the NAN (Neighborhood Aware Networking) interface.

The patch includes changes to the nl80211_vendor_cmd() function in the nl80211.c file. It adds a condition to check if the wdev (wireless device) is not associated with a network device and the P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) and NAN modes are not started. If this condition is met, the function returns -ENETDOWN, indicating that the network is down.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a real security issue. However, it does seem to fix an issue related to the proper handling of vendor commands in the cfg80211 module.

Without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for obtaining the BOS (Binary Object Store) descriptor test scenario for USB 3.0 in the usbtest module. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the usbtest module.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to a dentry leak in the greybus driver's debugfs implementation. The patch includes the removal of the debugfs file and disabling the USB log. 

Since this patch addresses a specific bug related to resource management and potential memory leaks, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical issue. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding stub functions for v_sys, refclk, and unipro resource management in the greybus subsystem. These stub functions are currently not implemented and return 0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to ensure that tasklets are killed upon driver removal in the edma driver. It specifically targets vchan tasklets and ensures they are killed to prevent their execution after the driver is removed.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch introduces a new function called `edma_cleanupp_vchan` which is responsible for cleaning up and killing the vchan tasklets. This function is called in the `edma_remove` function to ensure proper cleanup during driver removal.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to tasklet cleanup in the edma driver. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does address a potential issue of tasklets being executed after driver removal.

   However, without further context or information about the severity of the issue and its impact on system stability or security, it is difficult to determine if this patch qualifies as a critical bug fix.

4. Decision:
   Given the limited information provided, it is not clear whether this patch addresses a critical bug or a significant issue that warrants inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further information or justification is provided.

Please note that this decision is based on the information provided and may change if additional context or details are provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the FPGA ioremap area in the ARM shmobile bockw board. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the `bockw_init` function in the `arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-bockw-reference.c` file.

2. It declares a local variable `fpga` of type `void __iomem *`.

3. The patch removes the `static` keyword from the declaration of `fpga`. This change suggests that the `fpga` variable should not be kept across multiple invocations of the `bockw_init` function.

4. The `ioread16` and `iowrite16` functions are used to read and write data to the `fpga` memory-mapped I/O region.

5. The patch adds a call to `iounmap(fpga)` to unmap the `fpga` memory-mapped I/O region.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the FPGA ioremap area by correctly unmapping the memory-mapped I/O region. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the AXP20X and AXP22X battery drivers to the MFD cells of the AXP209, AXP221, and AXP223 MFDs. 

Since this patch is adding functionality rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch simply adds checks for NULL or error pointers and returns early if they are encountered. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds definitions for Skylake stepping revision IDs. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "ops" member of the "ds2404" structure and the "ds2404_chip_ops" structure. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for unregistering the connector during component removal in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds the necessary calls to `drm_connector_unregister()` and `drm_connector_cleanup()` in the `hdmi_connector_destroy()` function.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to component removal and ensures proper cleanup, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the OMAP platform's USB OTG events. The patch marks the interrupt handler as shared using the IRQF_SHARED flag.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses the need to share the IRQ for OTG events on OMAPs, which is crucial for proper functioning.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly mention any of these issues. However, the need to share the IRQ suggests that not doing so could potentially lead to issues like missed interrupts or incorrect handling of OTG events.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It specifically modifies the IRQ handling code to mark the interrupt handler as shared.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue related to IRQ handling on OMAPs, which could potentially lead to functional problems if not fixed.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch fixes a bug related to the pageflip finish event for interlace mode in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs.

2. Bug description: The bug occurs when checking the top field vsync in interlace mode. The comparison is incorrect because it compares the DMA address converted by start coordinates with the non-converted DMA address.

3. Patch changes: The patch modifies the mixer_irq_handler function in the exynos_mixer.c file. It introduces two new variables, "base" and "shadow," and updates the existing variable "val_base" to "base" for clarity.

4. Patch logic: The patch checks if the base and shadow registers for each window's DMA address match in interlace mode. If they don't match, the patch exits the function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that can cause incorrect behavior in the DRM driver for Exynos GPUs. The bug can potentially lead to visual artifacts or corruption in interlaced mode. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a flag to indicate that a recovery work was initiated on purpose to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set.

2. The BUG_ON() macro is modified to include an additional condition that checks if the bug_on_recovery flag is set and if the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is not set in the wl->flags bitfield.

3. In the wl1271_op_add_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before initiating the recovery work.

4. In the wl1271_op_remove_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before queuing the recovery work.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary fix to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set. It also ensures that the recovery work is initiated intentionally by setting the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new sysfs file to show the Latency Tolerance Messaging (LTM) capabilities of USB devices. This does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial change that does not provide any significant improvement or fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch replaces the call to `call_usermodehelper_fns()` with `call_usermodehelper_setup()` and `call_usermodehelper_exec()`. This change is made to ensure that if an out-of-memory (OOM) condition occurs during the execution of `call_usermodehelper_exec()`, the cleanup function `umh_keys_cleanup()` is still called, preventing a potential memory leak and ensuring that `key_put()` is properly invoked.

Given that this patch addresses a potential issue related to memory management and cleanup, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch moves the initialization of the `rateinfo` structure to a separate helper function called `rateinfo_init()`. This change is done to avoid bloating the main match function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new function `dso__last_symbol()` to find the last symbol in a DSO (Dynamic Shared Object). This function will be used when parsing address filters to calculate a region that includes the entire DSO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or functionality rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that made changes to the ARM shmobile emev2 code. The reason for the revert is that the code changes the flags of the wrong CPUs, which breaks the bootup of secondary CPUs.

The patch itself does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses an issue that affects the bootup of secondary CPUs.

Given that the patch does not fix a critical bug and does not address a real and critical issue, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the usage of the deprecated "cpus_" function and replaces it with the recommended "cpumask_" function. This indicates that the patch is addressing a deprecated code usage, which can lead to potential issues or bugs.

2. The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve replacing a deprecated function with the correct one, which suggests that it is addressing a real and critical bug or issue.

3. The patch modifies the "irq_ia64.c" file in the "arch/ia64/kernel" directory. This indicates that it is targeting a specific architecture and kernel component, which further suggests that it is addressing a specific issue or bug.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the usage of a deprecated function in the IA64 architecture. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the ACPI device ID array in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a numeric value with a defined constant. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the nve0_fifo_intr_engine function in the nve0.c file of the Nouveau DRM driver. The patch adds a missing call to nouveau_event_trigger, which triggers an event for the given private data structure.

Since the patch fixes a bug that could potentially cause an issue with event triggering in the nve0_fifo_intr function, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by removing unnecessary comparisons. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it only improves code readability without addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling `schedule_work()`. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the i2c-mxs driver. The patch addresses the issue of the driver ignoring the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit during the busy-waiting loop, which causes slow scanning of the i2c bus.

Since this bug affects the functionality and performance of the i2c-mxs driver, it can be considered a real issue that needs to be fixed. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error when the mc138xxx driver is built as a module. The error is related to undefined symbols "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" in the mc13892-regulator.ko module.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the changes in the patch seem to be trivial, as they only export two symbols using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a whitespace before a parenthesis, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch warning related to code formatting. The change only modifies the indentation of a syslog message. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential scheduling issue caused by calling `clk_get_rate()` in `sdhci_s3c_set_clock()`, which may sleep. The patch aims to cache the rates of all bus clocks at probe time and use those cached values instead.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the initialization of the `mtd_oob_ops` structure in the `nand_base.c` file. The patch initializes the structure using `memset` instead of explicitly setting individual fields to NULL.

The patch also mentions that the ooblen field is not being initialized, but it is not critical since users check if oobbuf is NULL first. However, it is considered good practice to zero out unused fields.

The patch includes a reference to Coverity IDs #200821 and #200822, indicating that the issue was identified by static code analysis.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity and follows best practices. It does not introduce any trivial changes or fix spelling or whitespace issues. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a "line over 80" issue and resolves a "blank line" issue. These types of changes, such as removing comments and adjusting whitespace, are considered trivial and do not fix any real or critical bugs.

Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change simply moves the assignment of `*gpio_base = -1;` to an earlier position in the code. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "f2fs: detect error of update_dent_inode in ->rename"
   The patch aims to detect errors in the update_dent_inode function during the rename operation in the f2fs file system.

2. Patch Description:
   The patch adds error checking and handling for the return value of the update_dent_inode function in the f2fs_rename function.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch modify the f2fs_rename function in the fs/f2fs/namei.c file.

   - Line 658: The patch adds a call to the update_dent_inode function, passing the old_inode, new_inode, and new_dentry->d_name as arguments.
   - Line 660: The patch checks the return value of the update_dent_inode function and assigns it to the 'err' variable.
   - Line 661-663: If the 'err' variable is non-zero, indicating an error in the update_dent_inode function, the patch releases the orphan inode and jumps to the 'put_out_dir' label.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential error in the update_dent_inode function during the rename operation in the f2fs file system. It adds error checking and handling to ensure that any errors are properly detected and handled.

   Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for different MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths. This can be useful for systems that require separate memory regions for transmitting and receiving data.

2. If only one region is specified, it is assumed to be shared between Rx and Tx, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. The patch also assigns the Tx channel to Rx if the MMIO regions are different and Rx is not specified. This ensures that the system can still function with a single channel dealing with both Tx and Rx.

4. The patch modifies the structure `struct mbox_test_device` to include separate `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers for the MMIO regions.

5. The `mbox_test_message_write` function is modified to check if `tx_mmio` and `signal` are not NULL before printing and sending the signal.

6. The `mbox_test_receive_message` function is modified to check if `rx_mmio` is not NULL before copying the received message from the MMIO region to the `rx_buffer`.

7. The `mbox_test_prepare_message` function is modified to check if `tx_mmio` is not NULL before copying the message to the MMIO region.

8. The `mbox_test_probe` function is modified to handle separate MMIO regions for Tx and Rx. It maps the resources to `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers, and if Rx is not specified but has a separate MMIO region, it assigns the Rx channel to the Tx channel.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds functionality to support separate MMIO regions for Tx and Rx, ensuring compatibility and flexibility. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a line over 80 characters warning detected by the checkpatch.pl script. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the code. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would say that it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "ALSA: fireworks: Fix wrong value as argument for PTR_ERR()". This suggests that it addresses a bug related to the fireworks sound driver in the ALSA subsystem.

The patch modifies the `hwdep_write` function in the `fireworks_hwdep.c` file. In this function, the `memdup_user` function is called to duplicate user data into kernel space. If `memdup_user` fails, it returns an error pointer, which should be passed to `PTR_ERR` to obtain the correct error code.

However, in the original code, the `PTR_ERR` function is called with the `data` argument instead of the `buf` argument. This is incorrect and could lead to incorrect error reporting.

The patch fixes this issue by changing the argument of `PTR_ERR` to `buf`, ensuring that the correct error code is returned.

Based on this analysis, the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect error reporting. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a code refactoring or optimization without any functional change.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring patch that breaks up a long function into smaller functions for better code readability. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "_single" suffix from the page table allocator functions in the i915 driver. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the parameter `dma_mask` to `max_addr` in the `blk_queue_bounce_limit()` function. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is as follows:

```
ste_dma40: Delete an unnecessary variable initialisation in d40_probe()

After analyzing the patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary variable initialization. The variable "res" is declared but not used until it is assigned a value later in the code. Therefore, the explicit initialization of "res" to NULL at the beginning is unnecessary.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a trivial fix (removing unnecessary code), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue where calling Q_GETNEXTQUOTA on a filesystem with quotas disabled causes an oops. The fix involves checking early whether the filesystem has quotas enabled and returning an appropriate error code (-ESRCH) if quotas are not enabled.

The patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause an oops. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a change related to ACPI Power Management Timer (PM Timer) in the ACPICA module. The patch makes the PM Timer optional, aligning with ACPI 5.0A specifications.

Since the change doesn't directly affect Linux and doesn't fix any real and critical bugs, it seems to be more of an enhancement or compatibility improvement rather than a fix for an existing issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated function `simple_strtoul` with the recommended function `kstrtoul`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an extra variable declaration. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for whitespace issues in the `spidev_test` file. The changes include fixing indentation and removing unnecessary whitespace. Since this patch does not fix any real or critical bug, and it only contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to increase the timeout for aborting transmission in the ath9k wireless driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch increases the timeout for aborting transmission in the ath9k wireless driver.
2. It introduces a new variable `maxdelay` and initializes it to 1000.
3. It checks if the current channel is a half-rate or quarter-rate channel and adjusts the `maxdelay` accordingly.
4. It writes a value to a register to abort the transmission.
5. It sets some bits in various registers to handle the abort process.
6. It loops through the queues and waits for a certain delay before checking if the transmission has been aborted.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a performance optimization related to transmission abort timeouts.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that only reformats pointer variables in the main.c file to meet kernel coding standards. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that renames the driver from "ohci" to "ohci-da8xx" in the davinci ohci driver. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the LM63 driver in the hwmon subsystem. The patch adds support for the LM64 and LM96163 chips, which have a dedicated pin for fan speed monitoring. The patch ensures that fan monitoring is always enabled for the LM64 chip and can be disabled for the LM96163 chip.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement to the driver rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary iteration and uses the passed argument directly. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing module license to the dwc-xlgmac driver. This fix addresses a warning about the lack of a license when building the driver as a module.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a type-safe register accessor macros patch for the drm/nouveau/device driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds privileged register interface accessor macros to the nvkm_device struct in the nvkm/core/device.h header file.

2. The added macros provide type-safe access to read and write registers using the ioread and iowrite functions.

3. The macros use the nvkm_device pointer to access the mmio (memory-mapped I/O) region of the device.

4. The nvkm_mask macro is a bit more complex. It reads the current value of a register, applies a mask to clear specific bits, sets new values, and writes the modified value back to the register.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary functionality to the nvkm_device struct and provides type-safe register access macros. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functionality and improves the safety of register access.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for legacy initialization of the wl12xx wireless module on VAR-STK/DVK-OM44 boards. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and arguments in the function `ced_get_out_buf_space()`. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two bugs in the __lpc_handle_xmit() function of the lpc_eth driver. Let's analyze each bug fix to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a Linux -stable release.

Bug 1: Potential skb leak when TXSTATUS_ERROR is set
The patch removes the dev_kfree_skb_irq(skb) call from its original position and places it after the tx_packets and tx_bytes statistics updates. This ensures that the skb is always freed, even if TXSTATUS_ERROR is set. This bug fix addresses a potential resource leak and prevents any data corruption or hang issues. It qualifies as a real and critical bug fix.

Bug 2: Wake up txqueue when no slot was freed
The patch adds a condition to check if the number of used transmit buffers is less than or equal to half of the total transmit descriptors (ENET_TX_DESC/2). If this condition is met, it wakes up the txqueue using netif_wake_queue(). This bug fix prevents unnecessary wake-ups when no slot was freed, which could potentially cause performance issues. Although it may not be as critical as the first bug fix, it still qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering that both bug fixes address real and critical issues, and do not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the RTC (Real-Time Clock) interrupt handler during resume. The issue caused the timer for the alarm to not be removed, leading to subsequent timers not being cleared and causing timeouts for utilities like hwclock.

Considering the nature of the issue and its impact on system functionality, it seems to be a real and critical bug that can cause unexpected behavior and potential data corruption. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two issues related to the update-qp command in the mlx4_core driver. The first issue is a wrong bit mask for the supported driver features, and the second issue is a wrongly voided return value of the mlx4_update_qp() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address more of a code correctness issue rather than a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. The patch adds missing configuration for MBUS windows access protection in the mvneta_conf_mbus_windows function. This configuration was unused since the initial support in v3.8, causing the register contents to be inherited from the bootloader.

The patch includes the necessary changes to enable the access protection by writing to the MVNETA_ACCESS_PROTECT_ENABLE register. This fix addresses a potential security issue by ensuring that the register contents are properly configured.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to security, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the usage of prsctp policies in the sctp module. The patch changes the check for prsctp enablement from `asoc->prsctp_enable` to `asoc->peer.prsctp_capable`, ensuring that prsctp is enabled on both the local and peer hosts before proceeding with prsctp policies.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug and improves the correctness of the prsctp feature, it can be considered a valid fix. However, without further context or information about the severity of the bug or the impact it may have, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the severity of the bug, any known issues or regressions caused by the patch, and whether it has been tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a bug in the tvp5150 driver related to the hue control. The missing break statement in the set control handler causes the hue control to enable or disable the decode completely. The patch adds the missing break statement to fix this issue.

Since this bug can potentially lead to incorrect behavior and impact the functionality of the tvp5150 driver, it can be considered a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The Tilera boot infrastructure now provides the initramfs to Linux with a different name, "initramfs", instead of "initramfs.cpio.gz". This change allows for the use of different compression techniques without causing confusion.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications.

3. The patch ensures compatibility with older kernels: By falling back to checking for the old name ("initramfs.cpio.gz"), the patch ensures that older kernels remain compatible with the newer Tilera boot infrastructure.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and includes appropriate Cc's: It has been reviewed and acknowledged by the author, Chris Metcalf, and is also Cc'd to the stable mailing list and the relevant file (arch/tile/kernel/setup.c).

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a critical bug related to the async_probe generic module parameter. The bug causes a crash whenever the async_probe parameter is used, which qualifies as a "real and critical bug" according to the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Additionally, the patch seems to address the issue by adding the missing argument to the parse_args() function call, as originally intended. This fix aligns with the requirement of addressing the root cause of the bug rather than providing trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference in the bcm2835_i2c_isr() function. This bug was introduced in the commit e2474541032d, which fixed a hang issue but inadvertently introduced the possibility of a NULL pointer dereference.

The patch adds a check for a NULL curr_msg pointer before accessing its flags field. If the curr_msg pointer is NULL, it logs an error message indicating an unexpected interrupt. Otherwise, it proceeds with the existing logic.

Given that this patch addresses a critical bug that could lead to a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a bug related to the translation of source code lines for call chains of user space applications in the perf report tool. The patch modifies the code to use the "addr" field of the "addr_location" structure instead of the "ip" field for entries.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and improves the accuracy of the reported call chains, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue where kprobes fail to find symbols even if they exist in the map. The patch replaces the use of `map__load()` with `map__find_symbol_by_name()` to correctly search for symbols in the map.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a performance improvement or a non-critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the code related to setting the 'action' to 'idle' in the md (multiple devices) subsystem. The issue arises when checking the 'sync_thread' variable without holding the 'mddev_lock'. This can lead to a race condition where md_check_recovery could reap the thread and start another thread, causing confusion.

The patch proposes a solution by introducing a check for the MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING flag before acquiring the 'mddev_lock'. If the flag is set, the patch flushes the workqueue, reaps the sync thread, and then releases the lock. This ensures that the necessary synchronization is in place to avoid the race condition.

The patch also includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the fix and understanding its context.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to confusion and potential issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not consider other factors such as compatibility with other patches or specific kernel versions. A thorough review and testing of the patch in the target environment is always recommended before inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "f2fs: fix the debugfs entry creation path." This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the creation of debugfs entries in the f2fs filesystem.

2. The patch description mentions that the "status" debugfs entry will be maintained for the entire F2FS filesystem, regardless of the number of partitions. It proposes moving the initialization of the entry to the init part of f2fs and performing the destruction from the exit part. This change ensures that the entry creation code is not executed for individual partition mounts.

3. The patch includes modifications to the file `fs/f2fs/debug.c` and the header file `fs/f2fs/f2fs.h`, as well as a small change in `fs/f2fs/super.c`.

4. In `fs/f2fs/debug.c`, the function `init_stats` is renamed to `f2fs_build_stats`. The function initializes the statistics related to the f2fs filesystem and creates the "status" debugfs entry. The function is no longer called directly from `f2fs_build_stats` but is now called from the init part of f2fs.

5. The function `f2fs_destroy_stats` is modified to include the destruction of the debugfs entry.

6. Two new functions, `f2fs_create_root_stats` and `f2fs_destroy_root_stats`, are added to handle the creation and destruction of the debugfs entry in the root of the f2fs filesystem.

7. In `fs/f2fs/f2fs.h`, the function declaration `destroy_root_stats` is replaced with `f2fs_create_root_stats` and `f2fs_destroy_root_stats`.

8. In `fs/f2fs/super.c`, the function `f2fs_create_root_stats` is called during the initialization of the f2fs filesystem, and `f2fs_destroy_root_stats` is called during the exit.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix an issue related to the creation of debugfs entries in the f2fs filesystem. It does not seem to introduce any trivial changes and addresses a potential bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The call to topology_init is currently too late for the set_sched_topology call, resulting in the default topology array being established before the s390 specific topology array can be registered.

2. The patch proposes a solution: It suggests using the smp_cpus_done() call to register the s390 specific topology array early enough, before the initial scheduling domain structure is established.

3. The patch is targeted for stable releases: It includes the "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" line, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author: It includes the "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the scheduling domain structure on s390 architecture. It does not contain trivial fixes and is suitable for inclusion in stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the TX queue in the mlx4_en driver. It removes the "blocked" flag and replaces it with a call to netif_tx_queue_stopped to check the state of the queue. This change aims to avoid a race condition where the completion function may incorrectly open the TX queue.

The patch also simplifies the code by removing unnecessary operations related to the "blocked" flag. Instead, it directly checks if the queue is stopped and if at least one packet was completed before waking up the TX queue.

The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They address a potential race condition and improve the code logic.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak in the error path of the function `rsi_send_auto_rate_request()` in the `rsi_91x_mgmt.c` file. The patch frees the previously allocated `skb` in case memory allocation for the `selected_rates` array fails.

Since this patch addresses a potential memory leak, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the fix seems to be a trivial one, as it only involves freeing a previously allocated `skb` in an error path.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HID i2c-hid driver. It fixes a problem where the driver fails to probe if GPIO support is not enabled in the kernel configuration. The issue was introduced in a previous commit that did not handle the case when GPIO support is disabled.

The patch checks the return value of the acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() function and only fails the probe if the return value is less than 0 and not equal to -ENXIO. This ensures that the driver does not fail if GPIO support is not enabled, as intended.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by a user, and it is signed-off by two maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

2. The bug is described with a sample stack trace, indicating that it can cause hangs in blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait, which is a critical issue.

3. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the fix. It mentions that the return value from atomic_long_inc_not_zero() can have high bits set, causing the tryget routines to return "false" even when a reference is acquired. The fix is to use an actual boolean internally instead of the truncated atomic long result.

4. The patch includes relevant metadata, such as the Fixes tag, which references the commit that introduced the issue, and the Link tag, which provides additional information about the bug.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including the original author and other maintainers.

6. The patch is also marked for consideration in stable releases, indicating that it is suitable for backporting to older kernel versions.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is intended to fix a bug related to the handling of dirty data in the F2FS file system. The patch adds a check for the "s_dirty" flag under the "cp_mutex" lock and skips the checkpoint operation if the flag is not set. Additionally, it removes a previous condition in the "f2fs_sync_fs" function that checked for the "s_dirty" flag and the presence of dirty nodes before returning early.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug that falls into the specified categories. Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.

However, from a code analysis perspective, the changes made in the patch seem reasonable and do not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Given the limited information available, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) unless there are additional factors or information that suggest otherwise.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to handle races with hardware (HW) when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The issue being addressed is that if the time to the next alarm is short enough, there could be a race with the HW, resulting in an approximately 4-second delay until the alarm triggers.

3. The patch introduces a fix by checking again after updating the HW.

4. The patch is signed-off by Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to race conditions with HW and aims to prevent a significant delay in alarm triggering. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch is titled "ASoC: Disable register synchronisation for low-frequency WM8996 SYSCLK." It addresses an issue where register synchronization may occasionally take too long to take effect, causing I/O issues. The patch disables synchronization to avoid these issues.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it modifies the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function in `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.c`. It introduces a new variable `sync` and initializes it with the value of `WM8996_REG_SYNC`. This variable is then used to update the `WM8996_CONTROL_INTERFACE_1` register using `snd_soc_update_bits` function.

Additionally, the patch modifies the `WM8996_LFCLK_ENA` value to 0 when the clock rate is 32000 or 32768, effectively disabling the low-frequency clock.

In `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.h`, the patch adds a new definition for `WM8996_REG_SYNC` and its related mask, shift, and width values.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to register synchronization for low-frequency SYSCLK in the WM8996 codec. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the behavior of the driver to avoid potential I/O issues.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a real and critical issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

This can lead to the process being stuck and never terminating.

The patch introduces a new flag, DM_CRYPT_EXIT_THREAD, to signal the kernel thread to exit. The flag is set and tested while holding cc->write_thread_wait.lock, ensuring there is no racy access to the flag. Additionally, the patch removes an unnecessary set_task_state(current, TASK_RUNNING) following the schedule() call.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k wireless driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description explains that after a transmission attempt, an A-MPDU subframe can still have fi->retries at 0 if the retry count wasn't incremented due to powersave. This can lead to incorrect tracking of the subframe as part of the block ack window.

2. The patch modifies the ath_tid_drain() function in the ath9k/xmit.c file. It removes the conditional check for fi->retries and unconditionally calls ath_tx_update_baw() to update the block ack window with the sequence number of the subframe.

3. The ath_tx_complete_buf() function is then called to complete the transmission of the buffer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of the code to unconditionally update the block ack window. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Based on these points, the patch appears to address a real and critical bug related to UVD suspend and resume for non-APU devices. It does not contain any trivial changes and does not introduce any new risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous change that enabled link protections by default in the Linux VFS. The reason for reverting the change is that it has been found to break some applications and is considered unacceptable to break existing systems.

The patch provides instructions for re-enabling the link protections if desired, but it suggests that if security problems due to link attacks occur during the early boot sequence, there are bigger problems to address.

Given that the patch is reverting a change that caused issues for some applications and that it does not introduce any new critical bug fixes or security enhancements, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue is described as a possible race condition between mr tree insert and delete in mlx5_core_destroy_mkey(). This can lead to incorrect behavior if the key is reallocated and inserted into the radix tree.

2. The patch fixes the bug: The patch modifies mlx5_core_destroy_mkey() to first remove the mr from the radix tree and then destroy it. This ensures that the mr is removed from the tree before destruction, avoiding the race condition.

3. The patch handles radix tree insert/delete failures: If the radix tree insert fails, the patch logs a warning message, destroys the mr, and returns the error. This ensures proper error handling and cleanup.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs and review: The patch includes the necessary sign-offs from the authors and reviewers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the md (multiple devices) subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to refine the behavior of md_check_recovery to avoid unnecessary work and reduce the frequency of info messages from ->add_disk.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the patch description, it seems that the issue addressed is related to unnecessary work and excessive info messages, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not fix a critical bug that causes a severe issue, but rather addresses an optimization and informational improvement.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a locking bug in the SELinux/NetLabel glue code. The bug can cause a suspicious RCU usage error, which can potentially lead to system instability.

Considering that the bug can cause system errors and potential instability, and the patch addresses a critical issue rather than a trivial fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a memory leak in the query device function of the mlx5 driver for InfiniBand.
2. The fix involves freeing the dev->port when RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) cannot be enabled or when node data initialization fails.
3. The patch is associated with the commit "0837e86a7a34" that added per port counters.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Mellanox and reviewed by Mark Bloch.
5. The patch modifies the mlx5_ib_add function in the main.c file of the mlx5 driver.
6. In the mlx5_ib_add function, after initializing node data, if an error occurs, the patch jumps to the "err_free_port" label instead of "err_dealloc".
7. The "err_free_port" label is also used when enabling RoCE fails for Ethernet link layer.
8. The patch then continues with creating device resources.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a memory leak issue and ensures proper resource deallocation when RoCE cannot be enabled or when node data initialization fails. The patch also follows the necessary review and sign-off process.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the driver could crash on machines with more cores than the maximum number of offload queue sets allowed. This could be considered a critical bug as it can lead to system instability.

The patch modifies the `cfg_queues` function in the `cxgb4_main.c` file. It introduces a change to the calculation of the number of offload queue sets (`i`) by using the `min_t` macro to ensure that `i` does not exceed the maximum number of offload queue sets (`MAX_OFLD_QSETS`). This change helps prevent the driver from crashing on systems with more cores than the maximum allowed offload queue sets.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can cause system crashes and improves the stability of the driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch tablet (056a:00d0) in the HID: wacom driver. The issue is that the device is being removed before the mode setting can be executed due to the introduction of delayed work for querying the mode on all tablets.

The patch cancels the delayed work and calls the _wacom_query_tablet_data() function to set the mode on the ghost pen interface before removing the device. This ensures that the mode setting is executed before the device is removed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch tablet.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing spinlock initialization in the aq_ring structure in the Aquantia Ethernet driver. The patch adds the necessary spin_lock_init() function call to initialize the lock.

Since this patch addresses a missing initialization, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can cause GPU hangs. The patch disables the RHWO (Render Hang Workaround Optimization) in the GEN7_COMMON_SLICE_CHICKEN1 register, as recommended in the BSpec Workarounds page.

The patch also includes references to two Bugzilla entries related to the issue and has been tested by Eugeni Dodonov. It is signed-off by Kenneth Graunke and Jesse Barnes.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that the patch directly addresses it, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a build error, as indicated by the reported BUG message and the slab-out-of-bounds error.
2. The bug is reproducible on the Rockchip platform rk3368 SoC, which supports USB 2.0 and uses functionfs for ADB.
3. The bug is triggered when the kernel is built with CONFIG_KASAN=y and CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y, indicating that it affects kernel configurations commonly used for debugging and security.
4. The patch fixes the out-of-bounds access issue by checking if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. This ensures that the descriptor is only accessed when necessary.
5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering these factors, the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and is not a trivial fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the get_fmt callback function of the m5mols driver. The patch corrects an inverted check of the return value from __find_format().

Since this patch only addresses a typo and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. The patch is addressing a regression that was introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16, which caused a kernel BUG when starting an old X server.

The regression was caused by the BUG_ON statements being a crude approximation to verify that no batches were submitted to the kernel while the UMS/GEM client was suspended. However, these checks are too late and attempting to program the hardware in an invalid state is a more significant concern.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it removes a useless BUG_ON statement, it can be classified as a trivial fix. Therefore, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. As a result, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the Xen pciback driver and the resetting of pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called. The patch aims to avoid this reset in the 3.19 kernel version as a hotfix, with a proper fix planned for the next merging window.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as oops or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to indexing beyond the end of the failed_num[] and fdev[] arrays in the need_this_block() function in the md/raid5 driver. The patch limits the loops to a maximum of 2 iterations to prevent indexing beyond the array bounds.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch also highlights a separate issue related to console writes happening unlocked while port->sysrq is not reset.
6. The suggested solution involves introducing a separate indicator port->sysrq_cpu and modifying the locking check accordingly.
7. The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander and signed-off by Thomas Gleixner and Greg Kroah-Hartman.
8. The patch includes the necessary changes in the imx_console_write() function.

Based on the critical nature of the bug and the proposed solution, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the issue and prevent potential problems with debugging and kernel crashes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation introduces a race condition where accessing already freed memory can occur when the timer expires again.

2. The bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, as accessing freed memory is undefined behavior and can cause unpredictable results.

3. The patch provides a fix by replacing the problematic mod_timer function with mod_timer_pending, which ensures that the timer is not reactivated if it has already expired.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which helps in tracking the bug and its resolution.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a resource management issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver. The patch changes the logic to reinitialize descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume, instead of releasing and reallocating all resources from scratch.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to resource management, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The reported-by and signed-off-by fields indicate that the patch has been tested and reviewed by relevant individuals.

However, it is important to note that without further context or knowledge of the specific bug and its impact, it is difficult to fully assess the patch's suitability for stable releases. A more comprehensive analysis, including testing and verification, should be conducted before merging the patch into the stable branch.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds support for passing probe requests and beacons from other access points (APs) in AP mode and group owner (GO) mode in order to properly set the ht protection information element (IE).

Since this patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm in the TCP implementation. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause performance issues and longer HoL blocking. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged.
2. The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require calling prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical.
3. The original commit mentioned that it prevented waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates, but there are better ways to fix this.
4. The patch is signed-off by Maarten Lankhorst and Acked-by Laurent Pinchart.
5. The patch is also signed-off by Daniel Vetter.
6. The patch is available at the provided link.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It reverts a previous commit to allow drivers to decide when prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions are necessary, which addresses a specific issue related to atomic drivers and framebuffer properties. The patch has also received sign-offs from multiple contributors, indicating its validity and acceptance within the community.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Since this patch addresses a race condition that can potentially lead to issues during system shutdown or driver unload, it can be considered a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Summary:
   The patch aims to fix the SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open. It addresses a situation where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes. Additionally, if the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

2. Patch Analysis:
   The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to use the synack_stamp instead of tp->lsndtime to compute the SYNACK RTT. It also adds a check to only update the RTT if synack_stamp is available and there are no total retransmissions. Furthermore, it introduces a condition to check if the srtt (smooth round-trip time) is not set, in which case the RTT update is performed in tcp_ack().

3. Patch Impact:
   The patch addresses a specific scenario related to Fast Open and SYNACK RTT estimation. It ensures that the correct timestamp is used and avoids unnecessary RTT updates. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a "trivial" fix that does not address a critical bug or a significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to prevent input-only pins from being set as output for the MPC5121 platform. It adds a reject condition for input-only pins and optimizes the mach-specific quirk setup.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function to return an error (`-EINVAL`) if the requested GPIO pin is an input-only pin (GPIO 28 and above). It also updates the `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function to use the new `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` function for MPC5121 GPIOs and the existing `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function for other GPIOs. Additionally, it updates the `gc->get` function to use `mpc8572_gpio_get` for MPC8572 GPIOs and `mpc8xxx_gpio_get` for other GPIOs.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to the MPC5121 platform by preventing input-only pins from being set as output. This is a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. The patch also includes an optimization to reduce the number of lines in the mach-specific quirk setup, which improves scalability.

   Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug and includes an optimization that improves code efficiency.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `nouveau_mm_init` function in the `mm.c` file of the `drm/nouveau` driver. The purpose of the patch is to allow the creation of zero-sized memory regions (`mm`) in certain cases where a given chipset may or may not have a specific resource.

The patch introduces a conditional check for the `length` parameter. If `length` is non-zero, the `node` structure is initialized with the `offset` and `length` values. Otherwise, no initialization is performed for the `node` structure.

This change allows for more flexibility in handling memory regions and avoids the need to add checks for the existence of the `mm` resource throughout the codebase.

The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to memory management in the `nouveau` driver.

Based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it does address an issue that can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" situation, as it improves code readability and maintainability by avoiding unnecessary checks.

Therefore, while this patch does not meet all the criteria for a stable release, it can still be accepted as a non-critical improvement.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch addresses a deadlock issue caused by small NVMe-oF queue sizes (<32) where IB completions aren't sent until 32, causing the send queue to fill up. The error message indicates a failure in nvme_rdma_post_send.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch changes the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth instead of a magic define. It removes the magic define completely.

3. Code Analysis:
   The patch introduces a new function, nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit, which calculates the signaling limit based on the queue size. It handles the degenerated case of a device with queue_depth=1, where signaling is required for every message.

   In the nvme_rdma_post_send function, the condition for signaling completion has been modified. Instead of using a fixed value of 32, it now calls the nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit function. If the signaling limit is reached or a flush is requested, the send_flags are updated to include IB_SEND_SIGNALED.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to a deadlock caused by small NVMe-oF queue sizes. It introduces a more flexible signaling mechanism based on the queue depth. The changes made in the patch are not trivial and do not involve spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the intended behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It is a functional change that improves the clarity and correctness of the code.

3. The patch does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a safe and straightforward modification.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

Based on these considerations, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver in the musb subsystem. The bug was introduced by commit 7d32cdef5356, which caused the core platform driver to correctly return an error code when failing to probe.

The patch adds a validation check for the musb pointer before calling the `usb_phy_set_suspend` function, preventing the NULL pointer dereference. This fix addresses a potential issue that could lead to system instability or crashes during system suspend.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause system issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround or temporary fix for a specific issue related to HDMI not working when it's the default display. The patch includes a "HACK" comment and mentions that a correct fix would involve modifying the DSS related hwmod's mainclks and making changes in how optional clocks are handled in the DSS driver.

Given that the patch is labeled as a "HACK" and is not a proper fix, it does not address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). A proper fix should be implemented instead of relying on temporary workarounds.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch fixes a build error that was introduced by a previous commit. The error is caused by passing the address of a bit-field 'maxpacket' instead of its value to the 'usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit' function. The patch corrects this by passing the value of 'ep->ep.maxpacket' directly.

Although this fix may seem trivial, it is necessary to resolve the build error and ensure the proper functioning of the USB gadget driver. It does not fall into the category of "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the memory allocated for struct request_queue needs to stay around until all blk_exit_rl() calls have finished. This suggests that there is a use-after-free bug related to struct request_queue.

2. The crash log shows a general protection fault, indicating a critical issue.

3. The Fixes tag references a specific commit, indicating that this patch addresses a known issue.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers and has been reviewed by others, indicating that it has undergone peer review.

5. The changes in the patch modify the blk_exit_rl() function to take a reference on struct request_queue and properly handle the memory deallocation.

6. The patch is specific to the block subsystem, which suggests that it addresses a real and critical bug in that subsystem.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to memory management in the block subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt handling in the cavium-octeon MMC driver. The patch description explains that on certain OCTEON SoCs with CIU3, there is no interrupt masking local to the MMC bus interface, and attempting to write to the enable register can cause immediate interrupts, breaking the driver.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `octeon_mmc_int_enable` function to only write to the enable register if the `has_ciu3` flag is not set. This ensures that the register is not touched on SoCs where it can cause immediate interrupts.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause issues with the driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the hang of direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN. The patch includes changes to the ext4/inode.c and fs/ext4/page-io.c files.

The patch introduces a fix to ensure that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag and the increase of i_aiodio_unwritten are done simultaneously. This is important because ext4_end_io_nolock always clears the flag and decreases the counter at the same time. By not increasing i_aiodio_unwritten when setting EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN, the counter can go negative, causing some processes to wait indefinitely.

The patch also includes additional checks to be more defensive and safe for future changes.

Considering the nature of the issue being addressed (hang of direct I/O read) and the specific fix provided, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, and it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the IB/ipoib driver that can potentially lead to a deadlock. The patch modifies the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function to use down_read_nested instead of down_read to prevent a lockdep warning.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving a significant issue in the code.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the btrfs file system when read_tree_block() fails. This bug can lead to an oops and potentially cause system instability or crashes.

The patch sets the tree_root->node to NULL when read_tree_block() fails, preventing the subsequent code from triggering the error. This fix addresses the issue and prevents the NULL pointer dereference.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of interrupts in the iwlwifi driver. The bug causes the "inta" variable to not be properly reset after the spinlock is released, potentially leading to missed interrupts.

Considering the nature of the bug and its potential impact on the system's behavior, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that could result in missed interrupts, which can have adverse effects on the system's performance and functionality.

However, it is important to note that without further testing and confirmation of the bug's impact, it is difficult to determine the severity and urgency of the issue. If the bug is found to cause significant problems, it may be appropriate to prioritize this patch for inclusion in the stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized memory access issue when writing to oprofilefs on the s390 architecture. The patch checks the return value of the oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() function and returns an error if it is less than or equal to zero.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sctp_diag module in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the condition for skipping certain endpoints during the dumping process. 

The original condition checks if the idiag_states flag has any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN and if the endpoint's association list is not empty. The patch modifies this condition to also include the TCPF_CLOSE flag in the check.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a relatively minor fix that improves the accuracy of the condition for skipping endpoints during dumping.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the values of LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 in include/linux/poison.h. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is simply adjusting the values of poison pointers to be smaller.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that the previous fix accidentally modified the loop condition in too many places while fixing a real bug. This indicates that there was a genuine issue that needed to be addressed.

2. The patch correctly fixes the loop condition in the dual_emac mode section, where 'i' is used as an index into priv->slaves, which is a 0-based array. This fix is necessary to ensure correct behavior.

3. The other two changes, which are only used in switch mode, were incorrectly modified in the previous fix. In switch mode, 'i' represents the ALE port number, where port 0 is the host port and ports 1 and up are the slave ports. The patch restores the correct loop condition for switch mode, addressing the issue introduced by the previous fix.

4. The patch includes comments to clearly explain the intent and avoid future confusion. Additionally, a comment that previously stated the opposite of what was happening has been fixed.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a critical bug related to saving the state of list registers in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. The issue is that when saving the state of the list registers, the dirty LRs (List Registers) are not being cleared properly. This can lead to unexpected EOI (End of Interrupt) interrupts pending for virtual level interrupts.

The patch fixes this issue by ensuring that all dirty LRs are cleared to zero before saving the state. It checks if a dirty LR is set in the vgic_elrsr (Virtual GIC ELRSR) register and clears the GICH_LR_STATE (List Register State) bit in the corresponding vgic_lr (Virtual GIC LR) register. If the dirty LR is not set, it reads the LR value from memory and clears it to zero. Finally, it writes zero to the LR memory location.

This bug can potentially cause data corruption and disrupt the proper functioning of the virtual level interrupts in the KVM subsystem. Therefore, it qualifies as a real and critical bug that needs to be fixed.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the critical bug.

Considering the severity of the bug and the nature of the patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to the virtio console driver.

true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a race condition in the initialization of `nlmsvc_timeout` in the lockd daemon. The race condition occurs when `nlmclnt_init()` starts the lockd daemon and then calls `nlm_bind_host()` with the assumption that `nlmsvc_timeout` has already been initialized. However, there is no synchronization between `lockd()` and `lockd_up()` to ensure this.

The patch moves the initialization of `nlmsvc_timeout` into the `lockd_create_svc()` function, which is called during lockd initialization. This ensures that `nlmsvc_timeout` is properly initialized before it is used.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real issue that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the lockd daemon. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch has been tested and verified: The patch author mentions that they have seen a device take 14ms to halt, which justifies the need for the increased timeout value.
4. The patch includes the necessary information for backporting: It specifies that the patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.37, which contain the relevant commit for the XHCI PCI power management implementation.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals: It has been signed-off by Michael Spang and Sarah Sharp, indicating that it has undergone review and approval.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the suspend timeout issue in the XHCI driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to hash faults for kernel regions in the powerpc/spufs code. The bug was introduced in commit ac29c64089b7, which replaced _PAGE_USER with _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and denied kernel access to non-_PAGE_PRIVILEGED pages. However, this change was not reflected in the hash fault handler for spufs' kernel accesses, causing issues with DMAs required to establish SPE memory.

The patch adds _PAGE_PRIVILEGED to the hash fault handler for kernel accesses, addressing the bug. It includes the necessary Fixes tag and has been reviewed by relevant individuals.

Considering the patch fixes a real and critical bug that affects functionality and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an error in the pch_phub driver where the error return value is not properly initialized when pci_map_rom fails and no ROM can be mapped. The patch sets the return value to -ENODATA in this case, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a build error in the m68k architecture when CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM is enabled. The error is caused by an implicit declaration of the function `pfn_to_nid` in mm/ksm.c.

The patch adds a conditional check to use `pfn_to_nid` only when `ksm_merge_across_nodes` is false. Additionally, it wraps the call to `pfn_to_nid` with `NUMA()` macro, which suggests that it is expected to be used when NUMA is enabled.

Considering that this patch addresses a build error and does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem, it can be classified as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the USB module order in the mackerel board's USB configuration. This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression in the rt2500pci driver related to rfkill functionality. The regression was introduced by commit e2bc7c5, and the patch reverts to the old behavior to fix the issue. Additionally, the patch also addresses another issue related to unregistering rfkill on device removal instead of ifconfig down.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that caused a regression in the rfkill functionality of the rt2500pci driver. The regression could potentially lead to issues such as a hang or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue is described as a warning seen with W=1 due to a change in DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST. This warning is caused by the C compiler converting divide operations with unsigned divisors to unsigned, even if the dividend is signed and negative. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch checks for the divisor variable type when deciding which operation to perform, fixing the issue for DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(0, 2U). However, it mentions that negative dividends divided by unsigned divisors still return bad values and marks this case as unsupported.

3. The bug has observable effects: The patch mentions that the s2c_hwmon driver reports a value of 4198403 instead of 0 if the ADC reads 0. This indicates that the bug can cause incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It includes signed-off-by statements from Guenter Roeck, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds. It also mentions that the bug was reported by Juergen Beisert and tested by the same individual.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause incorrect behavior and has been reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

3. The patch handles the error case by printing an error message and returning the error code.
4. The patch then sets the devfreq->governor to the returned governor and proceeds with the event_handler() call.
5. If the event_handler() call fails, an error message is printed.

Based on the analysis, the patch fixes a real bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or failure in adding a devfreq instance. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) on SandyBridge due to performance issues and frequent lockups. The patch checks the generation of the Intel graphics device and sets the enable_fbc flag accordingly.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch addresses a performance issue and frequent lockups caused by enabling FBC on SandyBridge. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a security issue, it does address a critical issue that affects system stability and performance.

Considering the criteria, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that impacts system stability and performance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the L2TPv2 protocol in the Linux kernel. The bug was introduced in commit e0d4435f, which caused issues with the PPPOL2TP_SO_SENDSEQ setsockopt. The patch addresses this issue by updating the hdr_len session field whenever sequencing is activated or deactivated from userspace.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a bug that affects the functionality of the L2TPv2 protocol, it seems to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to lockups caused by iput() calls in the Btrfs file system. The patch replaces the iput() calls with btrfs_add_delayed_iput() to delay the iputs and prevent potential lockups.

Considering the patch addresses a potential hang issue, it falls under the category of fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to buffer allocation size in the gpio-74x164 driver. It corrects the allocation size from `chip->gpio_chip.ngpio` to `chip->registers`. This change ensures that only the necessary amount of memory is allocated for the buffer.

The patch does not involve any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It directly addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect memory allocation.

While the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does fix a potential problem related to memory allocation. Although the severity of the issue is not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to assume that incorrect memory allocation could lead to unexpected behavior or instability.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The driver incorrectly uses a max TID count of 9 instead of the correct value of 8. This bug can lead to a kernel BUG and a system crash, as reported by Nikolay Martynov.

2. The bug fix is non-trivial: The patch corrects the value of IWL_MAX_TID_COUNT from 9 to 8, addressing the off-by-one confusion in the code.

3. The bug fix has a clear impact: The bug fix resolves the reported kernel BUG and prevents system crashes when certain operations are performed.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not include spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the handling of bypass_val_on in the regulator_get_bypass_regmap function. Currently, the handling of bypass_val_on is done unconditionally, which causes some drivers to report bypass being enabled when it is not. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential issues.

The patch fixes this by introducing a check for bypass_val_on. If bypass_val_on is not defined in the driver, it uses bypass_mask instead. This ensures that the correct value is used for determining whether bypass is enabled or not.

The patch also includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the bug.

Overall, the patch fixes a real issue that can lead to incorrect behavior in certain drivers. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch simplifies the netlink message length assignment by using the precalculated size instead of subtracting and adding the netlink header length.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (simplifying code without addressing a real issue), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "iio: adc: at91: don't use the last converted data register." It addresses an issue where the last converted data register can contain touchscreen relative values if a conversion is requested on another channel while the touchscreen mode is enabled. This can lead to incorrect data being read from the ADC_LCD register.

2. Patch Changes:
   - Line 196: Adds a new variable "chnb" to the "struct at91_adc_state" to store the current channel number.
   - Line 274: Instead of reading from AT91_ADC_LCDR, the patch changes it to read from AT91_ADC_CHAN(st, st->chnb), which retrieves the conversion value from the channel data register.
   - Lines 351 and 418: The patch modifies the condition to check for the status of the data ready interrupt for all channels using the GENMASK macro.
   - Lines 689 and 708: The patch sets the "chnb" variable to the current channel number and modifies the enable and disable interrupt registers to use the BIT macro with the channel number.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to the last converted data register and ensures that the correct conversion value is read from the channel data register. It does not introduce any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect data being read from the ADC_LCD register. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the backref code in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch addresses a problem where nodes were being checked along with leaves when populating extent item entries, which could lead to unexpected issues. 

The patch modifies the code to only perform the check on extent item positions when the reference has no inode list and is at level 0. This change ensures that the check is only applied in the appropriate scenario, preventing potential issues.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` is being removed from the code. The patch states that there is nothing to prevent another thread from dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call to `nfs4_ds_disconnect()`, which could result in a NULL pointer dereference and potentially cause an Oops.

The patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid the issue by invalidating the device ID. However, it is not clear from the provided context whether this change alone is sufficient to address the potential NULL pointer dereference.

Without further information or context, it is difficult to determine the impact and severity of the bug being fixed by this patch. Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria for inclusion.

The patch addresses an issue related to the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver. Currently, when running the offline self-test, the dev_close() function is called, which clears the IFF_UP flag, resulting in the removal of interface routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior when the interface is brought down before the test.

The patch proposes calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(), avoiding the clearing of IFF_UP and the associated side effects.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue related to the offline self-test behavior and improves consistency in the driver's behavior. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Please note that this recommendation is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not consider other factors such as compatibility or potential regressions. A thorough review and testing by the appropriate maintainers is still necessary before inclusion in the stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops.
2. The bug is caused by an incorrect implementation in the workingset shadow nodes shrinker, which becomes memcg aware.
3. The patch fixes the issue by checking the sc->memcg variable instead of using memcg_kmem_enabled(), which ensures that only memcg aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs.
4. The fix has been tested and reported by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki.
5. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh.
6. The patch is also marked as a stable fix for versions 4.6 and above.
7. The patch is signed-off by the author, Michal Hocko, and the maintainers, Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds.

Considering the critical nature of the bug, the provided fix, and the positive reviews and testing, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to increase the maximum number of properties in the DRM subsystem from 16 to 24. The patch includes a detailed explanation of the issue it aims to address, which is hitting the maximum number of properties on i915 machines with many TV connectors.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to revert a deprecation warning message related to SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. The reasons for reverting the message are outlined in the patch description:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and cannot be changed, making the deprecation warning unnecessary.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. Many SCTP appliances are slow to migrate to newer kernels.

3) Some users may be unable to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems, and they would encounter the warning unnecessarily.

Considering these reasons, it appears that the deprecation warning is not critical and does not fix a real issue. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue. Therefore, it should not be included in a stable release.

However, it's important to note that the decision ultimately lies with the Linux kernel maintainers, who have a better understanding of the overall impact and implications of the patch.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the release of the mcc/mbox lock in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function of the be_cmds.c file in the be2net driver. The patch ensures that the lock is released in case be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the bug being fixed is related to the incorrect release of a lock, which can lead to potential issues such as resource leaks or concurrency problems.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues, but it can potentially lead to resource leaks or concurrency problems, which can have adverse effects on system stability and performance.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to lock release.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can have potential impacts on system stability and performance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an off-by-two bug in the "perf hists browser" tool. The bug causes misalignment in the normal output. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to the configuration of the direct_irq_en bit for pads using io mode in the pinctrl-baytrail driver. The patch forces the clearing of this bit and triggers a warning if it is misconfigured.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential misconfiguration that can lead to the io based irq not being detected, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses the use of variable-length arrays in the kernel/sys.c file. It explains that variable-length arrays can generate worse code without any significant benefit, unless the function is inlined and the compiler can optimize it based on a constant length.

Additionally, the patch mentions a specific issue reported by Henrik Bakken on the POWER architecture, where register r28 can get corrupted under certain circumstances. Although this indicates a potential compiler problem, the patch suggests avoiding variable-length arrays altogether, as they are considered bad practice regardless of this specific issue.

The patch modifies the code by replacing the variable-length array declaration with a fixed-size array of length 65. This ensures that the size is always valid and eliminates the use of variable-length arrays.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential code generation problem and improves code quality by avoiding variable-length arrays, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling the use of shadow registers in the iwlwifi driver by default due to reliability issues causing host command timeouts. The patch sets the `shadow_reg_enable` parameter to `false` for various iwlwifi devices.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch should be accepted (ACK) because it addresses a real and critical bug that can cause communication issues and host command timeouts. Disabling the feature until a fix is available is a reasonable approach to prevent further problems.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a regression where kswapd could previously compact, but kcompactd could not. The patch modifies the loop condition in two places, ensuring that the traversal includes the zoneindex that was previously excluded.

Since this patch addresses a real issue and improves the functionality of kcompactd, it can be considered a valid fix for a bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a build error caused by the removal of the LPSS_SSP type in commit 03fbf488cece.
2. The removal of the LPSS_SSP type was unintentional and likely added accidentally in commit a6e56c28a178.
3. The patch removes the incorrect binding, fixing the build error.
4. The patch is reported by Axel Lin and signed-off by Jarkko Nikula and Robert Jarzmik, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.
5. The patch is also marked as a fix for commit 03fbf488cece, further confirming its relevance.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug (build error) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by commit 05cc5a39ddb7 in the bnx2x driver. The regression causes a null pointer dereference when loading the 8021q module on machines with 57710 or 57711 adapters. The patch adds a check for the specific chip type (chip_is_e1x) to correctly set the accept_any_vlan flag.

Given that this patch addresses a real bug that can lead to a null pointer dereference, it should be considered a critical fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the dwc3 gadget driver related to resizing transmit (TX) FIFOs. The current implementation iterates over all endpoints, including both IN and OUT endpoints, which is unnecessary and potentially problematic.

The patch modifies the loop to iterate only over the IN endpoints that are actually present, based on the num_in_eps parameter. This change ensures that the loop terminates correctly and prevents dereferencing a potential NULL dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

The patch also includes a minor optimization by using the bit0 of the endpoint number to determine the direction (IN or OUT) instead of checking the number's parity.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific bug and improves the efficiency of the dwc3 gadget driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the SCTP module. This bug can lead to a kernel panic and is triggered by a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet. The patch addresses the issue by checking for a NULL return value from the sctp_get_af_specific() function, which could occur when processing parameters inside parameters.

Considering that the bug can lead to a kernel panic and the patch fixes the issue by adding a necessary NULL check, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The code accessing ctl_table is protected by grabbing the header with grab_header() and releasing it with sysctl_head_finish(). This is necessary to prevent issues when poll() is called in entries created by modules.

2. The bug can cause a hang or data corruption: The bug was reported by Dave Jones while using a syscall fuzzer during hibernation/resuming. The bug triggers a RIP (instruction pointer) error, indicating a potential hang or data corruption.

3. The patch includes a reported-by tag: The bug was reported by Dave Jones, adding credibility to the severity of the issue.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Lucas De Marchi, Andrew Morton, and Eric W. Biederman, indicating that it has undergone thorough review and testing.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a critical bug and does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the reported bug and prevent potential hangs or data corruption.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to enable the cpuid for Intel SHA extensions in the x86 architecture. It adds a new feature flag, X86_FEATURE_SHA_NI, which represents the SHA1/SHA256 Instruction Extensions.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the given patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it resolves. It seems to be adding support for a new feature.

Since the patch does not address a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it is not suitable for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the error message in the l2c310_of_parse() function. The patch changes the error message from "PL310 OF: cache setting yield illegal associativity" to "L2C-310 OF cache associativity %d invalid, only 8 or 16 permitted". 

Since this patch only modifies the error message and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to setting the IRQ thread policy without checking CAP_SYS_NICE. The patch replaces the use of sched_setscheduler() with sched_setscheduler_nocheck() to omit the CAP_SYS_NICE check for the SCHED_OTHER policy.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the patch description, it seems that the issue addressed is related to the thread's priority assignment in __setup_irq(). The patch ensures that the irq thread runs with the SCHED_OTHER policy even if the user does not have CAP_SYS_NICE. While this may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the behavior of the IRQ thread.

Regarding the triviality of the fix, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a non-trivial issue that affects the behavior of the IRQ thread.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix the syscall number update after a ptrace in the um/ptrace code. It updates the syscall number after each PTRACE_SETREGS on ORIG_*AX. This is necessary to ensure that the potentially altered syscall number is available in the seccomp filters after RET_TRACE. The patch also mentions that it fixes four seccomp_bpf tests that were failing.

2. Fixes:

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can impact the functionality of the bridge module, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch reverts a previous commit that caused a regression on the GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link. The commit being reverted is identified by its commit hash (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493).

The changes made by the patch include modifications to the stmmac_mdio_register function in stmmac_mdio.c and the stmmac_probe_config_dt function in stmmac_platform.c. In stmmac_mdio_register, the code now checks for a compatible child node with the name "snps,dwmac-mdio" and assigns it to the mdio_node variable. In stmmac_probe_config_dt, the code no longer assigns the mdio_node variable and instead checks if the phy_bus_name variable is present.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the bug being addressed by the patch. However, since the patch reverts a previous commit due to problems on specific boards when connected to a real transceiver, it suggests that the previous commit introduced a critical issue. Therefore, considering the potential impact on specific hardware configurations, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) cipher handle in the drbg_healthcheck_sanity() function. The patch just removes the test for generating random numbers before initialization.

Since the patch is removing a test that is considered inappropriate and unnecessary, it does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the PCI config address for DDW (Dynamic DMA Window) in the powerpc/pseries architecture.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue and improves the functionality of the DM thinp module, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The mvsas driver is causing a General Protection Fault when encountering an expander attached ATA device. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The analysis explains the root cause of the bug: The driver assumes all ATA devices are locally attached and obtains the phy mask by indexing the local phy table. However, expanders have more phys than the HBA, causing an overflow and returning incorrect data.

3. The patch proposes a fix: It suggests mirroring the approach used in mvs_task_prep_ssp() to obtain the phy mask using the port properties. This fix is expected to resolve the panic issue.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: It includes the reported-by and tested-by tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by Adam Talbot. This adds credibility to the patch.

5. The patch is signed-off by James Bottomley, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

Given these points, the patch appears to address a critical bug and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit and fixes shortcomings in the pci_restore_state() function. It ensures that the restoration of Base Address Registers (BARs) is retried only for Type 0 configuration headers, which is the correct behavior. 

The patch also includes a new function, pci_restore_config_space_range(), which is used by pci_restore_config_space() to restore the configuration space of the PCI device. The changes made in pci_restore_config_space() ensure that BARs are restored before the command register(s) for Type 0 headers, and for other header types, the entire configuration space is restored.

The patch has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Mikko Vinni. It is also signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki and Linus Torvalds.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of the pci_restore_state() function without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a loss of access to devices after resuming from S2. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the restoration of UCB1x00 gpio output data on resume. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect GPIO output data after a resume. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior in the system. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, even though the Software Developer's Manual (SDM) states that it is invalid. This suggests that the patch is introducing a behavior that is not officially supported.

2. The patch mentions that most of the code is already present to support exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0). This indicates that the patch is leveraging existing code to enable the desired functionality.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing a specific commit that it aims to fix. This suggests that the patch addresses a known issue.

4. The patch includes a "Tested-by" tag, indicating that it has been tested by Laszlo Ersek.

5. The patch includes a "Cc" tag, indicating that it is being copied to the stable mailing list for consideration in stable releases.

6. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" tag, indicating that Paolo Bonzini has reviewed and approved the patch.

7. The patch modifies the "em_rsm" function in the "arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c" file.

8. The patch introduces changes to handle exiting from system management mode in both long mode and 64-bit mode.

9. The patch clears CR4.PCIDE before CR0.PG if the vCPU supports long mode.

10. The patch sets up a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA if the vCPU supports long mode.

11. The patch clears CR4.PAE before clearing EFER.LME.

12. The patch sets MSR_EFER to 0 to go back to 32-bit mode.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces changes to enable exiting from system management mode in 64-bit mode and long mode. It addresses a known issue and has been tested. However, it is important to note that the SDM states that exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode is invalid.

Considering the potential risk of introducing unsupported behavior and the fact that the patch does not explicitly fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue in the madvise_free_huge_pmd function, specifically related to the return value after splitting a Transparent Huge Page (THP).
2. The original code skips fallback Page Table Entry (PTE) operations after successfully splitting the THP, which is incorrect behavior.
3. The proposed fix makes the madvise_free_huge_pmd function return 0 after successfully splitting the THP, ensuring that the fallback PTE operations are performed.
4. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors.
5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue in the madvise_free_huge_pmd function and ensures correct behavior by performing the necessary fallback PTE operations after splitting a THP.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough review of the code changes and testing may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI versatile host bridge driver. The bug causes the PCI IO resource to be considered valid even if the kernel fails to map the PCI host bridge memory address driving IO cycles to the CPU virtual address space.

The patch addresses this issue by destroying the PCI host bridge PCI IO resources retrieved through firmware when the pci_remap_iospace() function call fails. This prevents the kernel from adding the respective PCI IO resource to the list of valid resources, thereby fixing the problem.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to incorrect resource assignment and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the handling of the last register block in the specified range. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of registers that should be synced, resulting in either syncing too few or too many registers.

The patch correctly adjusts the calculation formula to ensure the correct number of registers are synced. It subtracts the number of the first register in the block from the maximum register number and adds one.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that can potentially lead to incorrect synchronization of registers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the powerpc specific nx-842 compression driver. The patch addresses the problem of not properly handling vmalloc addresses, which causes a failure when a proper physical address is not passed to the hypervisor.

The patch introduces a new routine, `nx842_get_pa()`, which checks if the address is a vmalloc address and handles it appropriately. It also modifies the existing code to use this new routine when converting addresses to physical addresses.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it fixes a specific bug related to address translation, it seems to address a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces structure assignments with the timer API functions `setup_timer` and `mod_timer`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses two issues in the dummy-hcd driver. The first issue is a NULL pointer dereference and a WARN_ON that can occur when unloading a gadget driver. The patch adds a check to ensure that the driver argument is not NULL before attempting to print the driver's name.

The second issue is related to the removal of a sysfs attribute file attached to the gadget. The patch moves the removal of the attribute file before the UDC is deleted, ensuring that it is properly cleaned up.

Both of these issues can potentially lead to bugs, oops, or data corruption, making them real and critical bugs that should be fixed. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the data type of two variables from 'u32' to 'int'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the transmission failure on a Sierra Wireless MC7710 device. The patch modifies the cdc_mbim_info structure by adding the FLAG_SEND_ZLP flag. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to a particular device.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression: The patch fixes a regression where the driver fails when Device Tree (DT) is enabled because the Device Tree probing code is not executed. This regression needs to be fixed to ensure proper functionality.

2. Rejigging probe() semantics: The patch modifies the probe() semantics to attempt to extract a platform ID from Device Tree if it cannot be sourced from platform data. This change ensures that the driver can identify the platform correctly when booting with DT.

3. Simplification of code: The patch removes unnecessary checks for platform data and executes the DT case only when platform data is not available. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

4. Proper error handling: The patch adds proper error handling by returning -ENODEV when both platform data and DT are missing. This ensures that the driver fails gracefully and provides a meaningful error message.

5. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Lee Jones and Linus Walleij, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the "mixer_wait_for_vblank" function.

2. It ensures that the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable is cleared by expecting the upcoming vsync interrupt handler routine to do so.

3. The patch enables and disables interrupts properly to ensure the expected behavior.

4. It calls "drm_vblank_get" to increment the vblank reference count.

5. It sets the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable to 1.

6. It waits for the vsync event to occur, and if it times out, it prints a debug message.

7. Finally, it calls "drm_vblank_put" to decrement the vblank reference count.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to vsync interrupt handling and waiting for vblank. It ensures proper synchronization and prevents potential issues like hangs or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to dropping the voltage to Vmin when the Graphics (Gfx) is power gated for the latest Valleyview (VLV) revision. The patch drops a workaround that is no longer needed for the latest VLV revision and instead requests the minimum frequency to bring the voltage Vnn.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to voltage dropping in a specific revision of the Valleyview chipset. However, it does not explicitly mention any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Without further information about the specific bug or issue being addressed and its impact, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that this patch may not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is necessary to fix a critical bug related to data corruption. The patch ensures that the timestamp is set as the last element in the channel specification, which is important for correct interpretation of the data by userspace code reading the buffer via sysfs.

Given that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator in the wm8962 ASoC driver. This is done to ensure that the driver turns off the regcache_cache_only after enabling the regulator, which prevents failures in commands like 'amixer cset' when run before wm8962_resume().

2. Impact: The patch addresses a potential issue where certain commands may fail if executed before wm8962_resume(). While the impact is not explicitly mentioned, it seems to be related to the proper functioning of the wm8962 ASoC driver.

3. Bug Severity: The patch does not explicitly state that it fixes a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does mention that failure can occur in certain commands, which implies that it could be an "oh, that's not good" issue.

4. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. However, without more information about the severity and impact of the issue, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a general protection fault (GPF) caused by a line discipline that does not define a receive_buf() method. The previous commit already addressed this issue, but the vt driver and speakup driver still push selection data directly to the line discipline's receive_buf() method via tty_ldisc_receive_buf(). This patch aims to fix the same problem in tty_ldisc_receive_buf().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug in the ocfs2_file_aio_write() function in the ocfs2 file system. The bug causes a lock to be left held if ocfs2_inode_lock() fails, which can lead to issues in ocfs2_lock_res_free().

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch in question is a revert of a previous commit that caused booting issues on a custom AT91RM9200 board. The original commit attempted to fix a boundary check issue when reusing static mapping in the ioremap function for ARM architecture.

The revert is justified by the fact that the original fix introduced incorrect conditions in the if statement, leading to incorrect mapping assumptions. Additionally, the original premise of the fix was flawed, as the code already accounted for the requested offset into the page.

Considering the revert fixes a critical booting issue and the original fix was incorrect, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make dropped packets consume the NAPI budget in the octeon-ethernet staging driver. This is done to ensure that the NAPI handler does not run for an extended period.

2. Patch Impact: The patch addresses a potential issue where the NAPI handler may run for too long, potentially causing performance degradation.

3. Bug Severity: The patch does not explicitly mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than fixing a critical bug.

4. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as an improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential lost wakeup scenario in the staging driver "quatech_usb2" when using the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl. The patch addresses a race condition between the qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status.

The patch introduces a barrier() to ensure memory ordering, sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and checks for changes in the modem status. If there is no change, it returns an error (-EIO), and if there is a change in the requested modem status, it returns success (0).

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a hang or incorrect behavior in the driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

8. It enables the PHY power in the omap2430_musb_enable function.
9. It sets the power and mode in the omap2430_musb_enable function.
10. It disables the PHY power in the omap2430_musb_disable function.
11. It sets the mode in the omap2430_musb_disable function.
12. It cancels the musb_idle_timer in the omap2430_musb_exit function.
13. It sets the musb->phy to NULL and cancels the omap_musb_mailbox_work in the omap2430_musb_exit function.
14. It unregisters the platform device, sets the power, and puts the runtime in the omap2430_remove function.
15. It saves the otg_interfsel value and performs a low-level exit in the omap2430_runtime_suspend function.
16. It performs a low-level init in the omap2430_runtime_resume function.

Based on the analysis, this patch seems to improve the PM runtime and phy handling for the 2430 glue layer in the musb driver. It fixes potential issues related to power management and PHY configuration. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue this patch addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further review by the appropriate maintainers and experts to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VCE ring test on Big-Endian systems. The patch ensures that every write to the ring is translated to little-endian. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the irq_domain_add() function. The current sanity check in the function tests whether desc->irq_data is not NULL or irq_data->domain is not NULL. This check prevents adding an irq_domain to an irq descriptor when irq_data exists, which is true when the irq descriptor already exists.

However, the check for irq_data == NULL is not separated, which can lead to confusion and potential issues. The patch splits the check for irq_data == NULL and adds a separate warning for it.

The patch also includes proper attribution and references to related discussions and commits.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential bug and improves code clarity. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the trace_marker file in the Linux kernel. The patch ensures that the trace mark is added to the correct per-instance buffer instead of the global trace buffer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific functionality improvement rather than a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch avoids a duplicate call to `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` for `ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE` within `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. This duplication is unnecessary since the call already occurs once during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation.

2. The patch removes the local `conn->stat_sn` assignment and increment, indicating that this should be handled by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

3. The third parameter of `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` is changed to signal that the assignment and increment of `cmd->stat_sn` should be done by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

4. The patch includes a `Tested-by` tag, indicating that it has been tested by Moussa Ba.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to duplicate calls and unnecessary assignments. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Since this patch addresses a potential problem that could lead to a build error or a functional issue (if the device is not properly enabled), it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the NVMe device driver. The bug occurs when the DMA alignment for the PRP entries does not match the device's page size, leading to a potential BUG_ON condition in nvme_setup_prps(). This bug can cause data corruption or system instability.

The patch proposes a solution by defaulting the NVMe device page size to 4K, which matches the IOMMU's page size. This ensures that the DMA alignment is correct and avoids triggering the bug. The patch also mentions the intention to update this path in the future to accommodate architectures with differing kernel and IO page sizes.

The patch has been tested and shown to resolve the bug, as the hardware test exerciser survives when using 32-bit DMA with the patch applied.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the sata_mv driver. The patch adds an error check for the return value of devm_ioremap, and if it returns NULL, it returns -ENOMEM to avoid the NULL pointer dereference.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause a hang or crash. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the RTC tracking code in the KVM ioapic driver. The patch introduces a new function `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` which checks if `pending_eoi` is negative and calls `kvm_rtc_eoi_tracking_restore_all` to recompute a correct `dest_map` and `pending_eoi` if necessary. 

The patch also adds a call to `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` in the function `__rtc_irq_eoi_tracking_restore_one` to ensure the validity of `pending_eoi`. Additionally, it adds a call to `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` in the function `rtc_irq_eoi` to handle the case when `pending_eoi` becomes negative.

Overall, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a bug or incorrect behavior in the KVM ioapic driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functions and modifies existing code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch reverts a previous commit that attempted to fix a reported issue with the 'capacity_now' value being higher than the 'full_charge_capacity' value when the battery is fully charged. However, the revert explains that this behavior is not unexpected and can occur due to variations in charging cycles and battery firmware updates.

The patch argues that capping 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity' is incorrect and that printing a warning when they don't match the 'design_capacity' is both annoying and incorrect. It mentions that this warning can cause false alarms on perfectly working systems/firmwares.

The patch also states that after the warning is triggered, wrong values are reported for 'capacity_now' and 'full_charge_capacity'.

Considering the explanation provided in the patch, it seems that the previous fix was unnecessary and caused more harm than good. Therefore, reverting the commit is a reasonable decision.

However, it's important to note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough review of the code and testing may be required before including it in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a potential issue in the mcb_probe() function of the mcb-core.c driver. The patch adds a call to get_device() to acquire a reference to the probed device.

The patch correctly addresses the issue by unlocking the mutex in the error case. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and Cc to the stable mailing list for consideration in the stable release.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to issues like hangs or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) on the arm64 architecture. The bug causes a regression in the coarse clock monotonicity, where obtaining a timestamp via syscall and subsequently obtaining a timestamp for the same clock ID via VDSO can result in an incorrect timestamp.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `update_vsyscall` function in `arch/arm64/kernel/vdso.c`. It replaces the usage of `__current_kernel_time()` with the `timekeeper` object provided by the timekeeping core. This ensures that the correct time is used for the VDSO timestamp.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect timestamps. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a module autoload issue in the net DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver for the Broadcom B53 switch.

5. The patch is signed-off by Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk> and Jani Nikula <jani.nikula@intel.com>.
6. It includes changes to the i915_gem_gtt.c file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes harm and has been tested and reviewed. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug causes a crash when ipi_destroy() is called on a multi-cpu system, attempting to free cpumask_weight() IRQs that were never allocated.

2. The bug can lead to a crash, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to modify the acpi_find_child_device() function in the ACPI/scan module. Currently, if there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope, the first one found to be present is returned. However, this behavior is not defined by the spec, and it may not match the ASL writers' expectations.

The patch suggests modifying the find_child_checks() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change is intended to cover the case where some devices have a _HID or _CID returning valid ACPI/PNP device IDs, which is disallowed by the spec. The ASL writers expect the OS to match devices without valid ACPI/PNP device IDs against a given bus address first.

The suggested change in find_child_checks() returns a higher score (FIND_CHILD_MAX_SCORE) if the device has a _HID or _CID returning a valid ACPI/PNP device ID, but the list of ACPI/PNP device IDs is empty. This makes the device look less attractive, allowing other devices with the same _ADR value (that may not have a valid device ID) to be matched going forward.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific case where the current behavior does not align with the ASL writers' expectations. It does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is a port of a previous fix for ARMv7 to ARMv8. It fixes the broken evtype mask to include the NSH bit, allowing profiling at EL2.

2. Impact: The patch addresses a bug in the ARMv8 architecture that affects the event selection register (PMXEVTYPER). The current mask (ARMV8_EVTYPE_MASK) is incorrect and needs to be updated to include the NSH bit.

3. Criticality: This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is a fix for an incorrect mask in the event selection register. While it may not be critical in terms of immediate impact, it is still an important fix for correct profiling at EL2.

4. Triviality: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to the ARMv8 architecture.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While it is an important fix for correct profiling at EL2, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that it fixes a memory leak on resume_latency.notifiers. Memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and system instability, making it a valid issue to fix.

2. The patch restores the original behavior of freeing the notifiers pointer on qos->resume_latency, which is used. This indicates that the fix addresses a real bug and is not a trivial change.

3. The kmemleak warning in the patch description further supports the presence of a memory leak issue that needs to be resolved.

4. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the bug and ensuring that the fix is applied to the correct code.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant parties.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to memory leaks, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the usbvision driver. The patch checks the number of endpoints before accessing the endpoint array to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `enable_lock` spinlock from the `imx-tve` driver in the Linux kernel. The patch explains that the `enable_lock` is unnecessary because DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions. Additionally, holding a spinlock while calling `clk_prepare_enable()` is incorrect and can cause a warning if debugging is enabled.

Considering the information provided, it seems that the patch is removing unnecessary code and fixing potential issues. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if the patch meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue being fixed and its impact on the system's stability, security, or functionality.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve allocating memory dynamically using kmalloc and properly handling the buffer.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch appear to be correct and do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author: The patch is signed-off by Mauro Carvalho Chehab, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses two issues in the nfs4_proc_lookup_mountpoint() function. 

First, it fixes the lack of error handling for the return value of rpc_clone_client(). Currently, the return value is not checked, which can lead to a memory leak if nfs4_proc_lookup_common() replaces the original value of 'client' due to NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC. The patch adds error handling to properly shut down the cloned rpc_clnt in case of an error.

Second, the patch simplifies the code by moving the call to rpc_clone_client() after nfs4_proc_lookup_common() has completed its operations. This ensures that the cloned rpc_clnt is only created if necessary, reducing unnecessary overhead.

The patch includes a reported-by tag and a signed-off-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Andy Adamson and the patch has been reviewed and approved by Trond Myklebust.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that can cause a memory leak and improves code simplicity. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

1. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.
2. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the admin queue in the NVMe driver.
3. It introduces a new helper function, "nvme_set_queue_limits," which sets the queue limits for the admin queue.
4. The helper function applies the same queue limits as the I/O queues, ensuring consistency and preventing potential issues.
5. The patch is focused on fixing a potential limitation in the admin queue, which could lead to command size restrictions and other limitations.
6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 platforms. The patch description explains that using the dummy clock with a rate of zero can lead to misconfigured timings and devices being lost on the bus.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical issue that can cause misconfigurations and device loss. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a real and critical bug related to the ceph connection state. The patch defines a new state called "CONNECTED" and updates the code to set and clear this state appropriately during connection establishment and closure.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the usb gadget serial driver. The crash occurs when the 'port->port_usb' pointer is set to NULL during the lock release period, but a request is still issued to gs_write_complete().

Considering that this patch fixes a potential crash, it can be categorized as fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects an allocation size issue in the watchdog core. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The current code generates lots of warnings when the system is run with the kernel 'threadirqs' option selected. This indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The bug causes warnings: The warnings indicate a potential problem with the page flip code being called in soft-IRQ context. This can lead to unexpected behavior or instability.

3. The patch provides a solution: The patch replaces the use of in_irq() with in_interrupt(). This change allows for either type of interrupt context and still detects and complains about misuse of the page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

5. The patch is relevant to stable releases: The patch is marked with the "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" tag, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. The patch aims to use a stored value for the maximum voltage (max_vddc) instead of looking it up manually each time.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ni_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `ni_dpm.c` and the `rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `rv770_dpm.c`. These functions are responsible for parsing power tables and adjusting voltage values if necessary.

2. The patch removes the variable `vddc` from both functions since it is no longer needed.

3. In both functions, if the voltage value (`pl->vddc`) is equal to `0xff01`, the patch checks if `pi->max_vddc` is non-zero and assigns it to `pl->vddc`. This change ensures that the stored `max_vddc` value is used instead of calling `radeon_atom_get_max_vddc` to look it up.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of the code and improves efficiency by using a stored value instead of performing a lookup each time.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to power management and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable. It may work for some people with specific USB host controllers, but for others, it causes the device to sleep and not wake up for important events like HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request.

The patch explains that there were initial attempts to fix this issue for some people by patching the xHCI USB controller, but it didn't work for everyone. It suggests that the problem could be in the USB subsystem, USB host controllers, or even a hardware issue. Since the cause is unknown, the safest action is to revert the patch.

Based on this information, it seems like the patch addresses a real and critical issue that can cause functionality problems with Intel Bluetooth devices. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves reverting a previous commit and provides a clear explanation of the problem.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch only modifies the calculation of statistics length for certain adapters in the qlcnic driver. Since it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, and it does not contain any non-trivial fixes, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic error in the original implementation of clock disable logic for the MMC hardware block in the sdhi and mmcif drivers. The patch corrects the logic by changing the bitwise AND operator to a bitwise OR operator in the clock disable code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that corrects a logic error.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix the wrong minimal dump size obtained from the rtnl_calcit() function in RT netlink. Currently, the function does not account for the size of the header of the netlink message, and this patch aims to fix that.

2. Impact: The issue addressed by the patch does not seem to cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or correctness improvement.

3. Patch details: The patch modifies the rtnl_calcit() function by changing the return statement from "return min_ifinfo_dump_size;" to "return nlmsg_total_size(min_ifinfo_dump_size);". This change ensures that the size of the netlink message header is accounted for when calculating the minimal dump size.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any real issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "xHCI: Clear PLC for USB2 root hub ports." It aims to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function.

2. Purpose of the Patch:
   The patch addresses the issue where the PLC bit is not cleared for USB2 root hub ports when the link state changes. Currently, the PLC bit is cleared for USB3 root hub ports but not for USB2 ports.

3. Patch Details:
   The patch adds a conditional check to clear the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function. It checks if the host controller driver's speed is not HCD_USB3 (indicating USB2) and then clears the PLC bit using the xhci_test_and_clear_bit() function.

4. Impact of the Patch:
   The patch ensures that the PLC bit is cleared for USB2 root hub ports when the link state changes. This helps maintain consistency between USB2 and USB3 root hub ports and prevents any potential issues that may arise from not clearing the PLC bit.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to maintaining the correct state of USB2 root hub ports. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It specifically adds a connector quirk for the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to incorrect Vbios connector table information and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function call in the lpc_eth.c driver. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the KVM virtualization module in the Linux kernel. The patch ensures that if the guest sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value, a general protection fault (#GP) is injected. This is important for maintaining the stability and security of the virtualization environment.

The patch includes changes in the "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c", "arch/x86/kvm/x86.c", and "arch/x86/kvm/x86.h" files. In "vmx_set_msr" function of "vmx.c", the patch adds a check using the "kvm_mtrr_valid" function to verify the validity of the PAT CR value before writing it to the guest's IA32_PAT MSR. The "kvm_mtrr_valid" function is defined in "x86.c" and performs checks on the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values. Additionally, the "kvm_mtrr_valid" function is exported for use in other modules.

Considering the nature of the bug and the changes made, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or security vulnerabilities in the KVM virtualization module.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to power-saving (PS) idle behavior in the ath9k wireless driver. The patch corrects an inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK, ensuring that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission is pending.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug in the PS idle behavior, which can impact power consumption and overall system performance.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? No, the patch does not address a security vulnerability.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK can lead to incorrect power-saving behavior, potentially affecting the stability and performance of the system.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not include trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel oops triggered by dereferencing a NULL Rx skb. This issue can be considered a critical bug as it can lead to system instability or crashes. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and hdelta is just a little larger than half a buffer time (e.g., in a ping-pong buffer). In such cases, the current condition wrongly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this issue, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that the condition is not triggered when hdelta is only slightly larger than half a buffer time.

The patch also mentions that jiffies, which is used for hdelta calculation, is not high resolution and may have inaccuracies. This comment highlights the need to consider the inaccuracy of jiffies when comparing hdelta.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario where the current condition incorrectly identifies double acknowledged interrupts. It improves the accuracy of the condition and takes into account the potential inaccuracy of jiffies. Since it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect interrupt handling, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata. The current implementation uses the padded length instead of the real length, which is a bug according to the specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all specified metadata has been 32-bit, where aligned and data length are the same width. However, it is still important to fix this bug to adhere to the specification.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it is fine to include it in the patch.

3. The patch gets rid of magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag to reference the commit that introduced the issue.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug in the encoding of metadata and improves code quality by removing magic numbers. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to USB Link Power Management (LPM) functionality in the Linux kernel. The bug causes the LPM feature to be non-functional due to the root hub device not having the lpm_capable flag set.

The patch adds code to check and set the lpm_capable flag when registering a root hub device. This ensures that LPM functionality is enabled for the root hub, allowing proper power management for USB devices.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of USB LPM, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to counting SCI interrupts as false ones in the ACPI EC driver. This issue can potentially lead to incorrect handling of interrupts.

It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address an issue where unfinished touch events can compete with pen events on tablets that support both pen and touch input.

2. The patch adds a check to ensure that if the pen comes in proximity while touch is down, touch is forced up before sending pen events. This prevents any potential conflicts between touch and pen events.

3. The patch includes changes in two functions: `wacom_intuos_inout` and `wacom_bpt_pen`.

4. In the `wacom_intuos_inout` function, the patch adds a check to return early if touch is still down. This ensures that pen events are not sent while touch is active.

5. In the `wacom_bpt_pen` function, the patch also adds a check to return early if touch is still down. This prevents pen events from being processed while touch is active.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to potential conflicts between touch and pen events on tablets. It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on critical functionality. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The bug was introduced in commit f8ec894945e7d205ce62be59e55e72c4304e4739, which allowed external callers to use slot dropping logic but unintentionally broke external users of input_mt_is_used().

The patch fixes this issue by introducing a new function, __input_mt_drop_unused(), which is called by input_mt_drop_unused() and input_mt_sync_frame(). This function iterates over the slots and drops unused ones by setting the tracking ID to -1. Additionally, the patch increments the frame count in both input_mt_drop_unused() and input_mt_sync_frame().

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause issues with input devices. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

4. Patch details:
   - The patch adds a new inline function `macb_clear_csum` to handle checksum initialization.
   - The function checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled.
   - If checksum offloading is not enabled, the function returns without making any changes.
   - If checksum offloading is enabled, the function ensures that the packet header can be modified.
   - The function then initializes the checksum field to 0.
   - This initialization is required for correct UDP header checksum calculation on Zynq for UDP packets with a payload size of <= 2.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to checksum offloading in the macb driver. It fixes a potential bug that could lead to incorrect checksum calculations for UDP packets on Zynq. Since this issue can cause data corruption, it qualifies as a real and critical bug.

1. Patch Title: "IB/srp: Avoid sending a task management function needlessly"
   - The patch title suggests that it aims to optimize the task management function in the SRP driver to avoid unnecessary sending.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch checks if there is no RDMA/RC connection or if the QP (Queue Pair) is in an error state before sending a task management function.
   - If either condition is true, the function returns -1, indicating that the task management function should not be sent.
   - This change ensures that the task management function is not sent needlessly, which could potentially prevent errors or unnecessary overhead.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a check at the beginning of the `srp_send_tsk_mgmt` function to verify if the target is connected (`target->connected`) or if the QP is in an error state (`target->qp_in_error`).
   - If either condition is true, the function returns -1, indicating that the task management function should not be sent.
   - This change prevents the unnecessary sending of the task management function when it is likely to fail.

   - The patch also removes a check in the `srp_reset_device` function that previously returned `FAILED` if `target->qp_in_error` was true.
   - This change suggests that the `srp_reset_device` function no longer relies on the `qp_in_error` flag to determine failure.

4. Patch Authorship and Acknowledgments:
   - The patch is signed-off by Bart Van Assche <bvanassche@acm.org>.
   - It is also acknowledged by David Dillow <dave@thedillows.org>.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to the SRP driver by avoiding the unnecessary sending of a task management function. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential error condition and improves efficiency. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a bug related to the capability check in net_ctl_permissions(). It addresses the issue of a denial audit message being generated when an LSM is enabled, causing confusion for application authors.
2. The patch switches the capability check to the noaudit variant, which is more appropriate in this context since a failed check does not indicate a violation of security policy.
3. The bug is considered critical as it affects the behavior of root-running Go applications and can lead to confusion and unnecessary denial audit messages.
4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
5. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by Serge E. Hallyn and signed-off by multiple developers, including Tyler Hicks, James Morris, Dmitry Torokhov, and David S. Miller.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and improve the behavior of the net_ctl_permissions() function.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Nouveau DRM driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a new error code, "INVALID_ADDR_SPACE," to the list of error codes for the gf100_mp_warp_error enum.

Since this patch is purely a documentation update and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the RX (receive) path of the virtio_net driver. The issue arises from calling virtqueue_enable_cq after napi_complete, violating the synchronization requirement with virtqueue_add_buf. This can lead to the loss of interrupts and potential panics in a debug build.

The patch proposes a fix by calling virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare with NAPI_STATE_SCHED set under the napi lock and later calling virtqueue_poll with NAPI_STATE_SCHED clear outside the lock. This ensures proper synchronization and prevents the loss of RX events.

The patch has been reported by Jason Wang and tested by him as well. It has also received acknowledgments from Jason Wang, indicating that the issue has been reproduced and verified.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a critical bug that causes hangs and incorrect behavior in NFSv4.1 OPEN requests on RDMA. The bug was introduced by commit 756b9b37cfb2e3dc, which overwrites the length of the incoming rq_rcv_buf with the value in rq_private_buf.len without initializing rq_private_buf.len in rpcrdma_bc_receive_call().

The patch fixes this issue by initializing rq_private_buf.len with the correct value in rpcrdma_bc_receive_call(). This ensures that svc_process_common() is invoked with a non-zero length RPC message, preventing failures and hangs.

Given that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes hangs and incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential deadlock issue in dm-bufio, which can occur with large block sizes.
2. The issue is caused by the allocation of kernel pagetables, which always use GFP_KERNEL, potentially leading to a deadlock.
3. The patch introduces the use of memalloc_noio_save and memalloc_noio_restore functions to set and restore the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag, respectively.
4. By setting the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag, all allocations in the process are done with the implied GFP_NOIO flag, preventing the deadlock from occurring.
5. The patch also mentions that for stable kernels, which lack the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag and the memalloc_noio_save/memalloc_noio_restore functions, the PF_MEMALLOC flag should be set and restored instead.
6. The patch is signed-off by the relevant contributors and includes the appropriate Cc to the stable@kernel.org mailing list.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch aims to fix firmware loading errors on some systems where the device does not respond or gives obscure values after cold, warm, or firmware reboot.

2. The patch retries to get the chip version and type five times. If it fails, it applies chip version 0x1 and type 0x9135.

3. The patch does not fix warm cycle problems from other operating systems and suggests that users should power off cold boot.

4. The patch modifies the "it913x_query" function to include a loop that retries the chip version and type retrieval five times. It also adds a delay of 100 milliseconds between retries.

5. If the chip version is not between 1 and 2 (inclusive), the patch sets the chip version to 0x1 and the chip type to 0x9135. It also prints an informational message indicating the failure to identify the chip version.

6. The patch modifies the "it913x_download_firmware" function to add a delay of 30 milliseconds before rebooting the device.

7. After rebooting the device, the patch checks if the device is responding. If it fails to respond, an informational message is printed.

8. The patch returns the status of the device after rebooting and checks if it is successful. If the reboot fails, an informational message is printed, and the function returns -ENODEV.

9. The patch sets the I2C clock to 400 kHz.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to firmware loading errors. It addresses issues with chip version and type retrieval and includes necessary delays. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a crash due to an uninitialized completion in the qedf driver.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to propagate the error code from failing to unregister a conflicting fb driver to avoid kernel panics.
2. The function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` is modified to return an integer value instead of being void. This change allows the function to propagate the error code.
3. The function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` now checks the return value of `do_unregister_framebuffer` and returns it if it is non-zero.
4. The function `do_register_framebuffer` also checks the return value of `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and returns it if it is non-zero.
5. The function `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` in `fbmem.c` is modified to return an integer value instead of being void. This change allows the function to propagate the error code.
6. The header file `fb.h` is updated to reflect the changes in the function signatures.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing error code propagation for the unregistering of conflicting fb drivers. This change is aimed at preventing kernel panics and improving error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference issue when loading the cx88_dvb module for a Hauppauge HVR4000. The patch checks whether the module was actually loaded, which is a safer approach. Additionally, the patch addresses some issues related to unloading and reloading modules.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a build error or a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical issue: The inability to allocate memory for RTAS (Run-Time Abstraction Services) can lead to various failures, including SMT threads, storage, and network issues.

2. The patch introduces a proactive approach: Instead of allowing the system to continue running with potential failures, it triggers a panic upfront if RTAS exists and memory allocation fails. This ensures that the issue is immediately identified and prevents further unpredictable failures.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It focuses on a specific and critical problem, without any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by two contributors: Anton Blanchard and Benjamin Herrenschmidt, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the renesas_usbhs driver. The patch addresses a situation where the controller is not able to complete the Control write status stage. 

The patch modifies the `usbhsf_pio_try_pop()` function by adding a condition to prevent disabling the pipe if the controller is in function mode and not a DCP (Default Control Pipe). This change aims to avoid clearing the PID_BUF wrongly and ensure the completion of the status stage.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file. The purpose of this revert is to remove the cond_resched() call from the function.

The reason for the revert is that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy() is called in an atomic context where scheduling is not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386 architectures. The revert argues that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy(), it is still better than using cond_resched() to cover only non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

Based on this information, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the use of cond_resched() in an atomic context. However, it does not appear to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect comparison in the powernow-k6 driver. The value of 'max_multiplier' is meant to be compared with clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself. This bug can potentially cause incorrect behavior in the driver.

2. The patch also improves the for-loop condition by using CPUFREQ_TABLE_END instead of hard-coding the loop count to 8. This makes the code more flexible and avoids potential issues if the number of elements in the clock_ratio array changes in the future.

3. The patch includes a Reported-by tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Viresh Kumar, and it also includes an Acked-by tag from the same person. This suggests that the bug has been acknowledged and verified by a trusted source.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug in the powernow-k6 driver and improves the code's flexibility. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has been acknowledged by a trusted source. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rtc: handle errors correctly in rtc_irq_set_state()". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function.

2. The code checks the correctness of the parameters but unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer. This means that even if the parameters are incorrect, the hrtimer is still armed or disarmed.

3. The consequence of this behavior is that a random task might arm/disarm the rtc timer, surprising the real owner by either generating events or stopping them. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially impact system stability.

4. The patch adds an error handling mechanism by introducing a check for errors. If an error is detected, the function immediately jumps to the "out" label, bypassing the arming/disarming of the hrtimer.

5. The patch also includes the necessary locking mechanism to ensure thread safety.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function. It prevents unexpected behavior and potential system instability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a backport of changes made to the x86 page fault handler for making it retryable and killable. The patch aims to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation on 64-bit sparc.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be an optimization for reducing mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would classify this patch as a performance optimization rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the vfio-pci driver's probe function. Currently, the code incorrectly checks the device type by using the PCI_HEADER_TYPE constant as a mask for the type value. However, PCI_HEADER_TYPE is actually the offset in the configuration space of the device type.

The patch fixes this issue by directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type value instead of using the incorrect mask. This ensures that only normal PCI devices are supported by vfio-pci.

The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and also mentions the relevant stable mailing list for consideration.

Based on the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause issues with non-normal PCI devices. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it meets the requirements for inclusion in a stable release.

Hence, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c) in the "drm/i915" driver.

2. The reason for the revert is that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

3. The original patch being reverted was considered nonsensical since the WARNING backtraces in the referenced bugzilla were about "gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits" mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

4. The patch includes changes in two files: "drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_lvds.c" and "drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_panel.c".

5. In "intel_lvds.c", the patch adds code to set the "8to6 dither" flag in the "gmch_pfit.control" field for gen2/3 hardware.

6. In "intel_panel.c", the patch ensures that pre-965 hardware sets the dither correctly for 18bpp panels.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware and fixes a reported problem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the KVM virtualization subsystem on ARM and ARM64 architectures. It modifies the vgic-v3.c file, which is responsible for handling the Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller (VGIC) version 3.

The patch aims to ensure that level interrupts are properly handled when reading back from the list registers. It introduces two actions for level interrupts:

1) Clearing the soft-pending bit if the interrupt is no longer pending in the list register.
2) Resampling the line level and propagating it to the pending state.

The patch makes an important change by decoupling these two actions. It ensures that the line level is always resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. This prevents the injection of spurious interrupts that have already been retired.

The patch includes appropriate sign-offs from the authors, indicating their contribution and approval.

Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to interrupt handling in the KVM subsystem. It addresses potential data corruption and the injection of spurious interrupts. The changes made are not trivial, as they involve modifying the logic for handling level interrupts.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes duplicate code in multiple drivers. The patch removes the unnecessary resource checks in the drivers and relies on the sanity checks performed by the `devm_ioremap_resource` function instead.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a build error caused by a conflict with the identifier "ffs" in the code. The patch converts the "ffs" macro from an object-like macro to a function-like macro to avoid this conflict.

Since the build error is causing a failure in the compilation process, it can be considered a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical issue that causes a build error.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific behavior related to restarting the device in the iwlwifi driver. The patch checks if the device is being restarted and ignores requests from mac80211 to stop Tx aggregation while reconfiguring the device. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided patch, it seems to address a specific behavior related to device restarts and does not appear to introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it has been thoroughly tested and verified to fix a real and critical bug without introducing any unintended side effects.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds locking using zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, preventing invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering that this patch addresses a potential memory access issue, it falls under the category of fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses the issue of checking the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit of dev->flags in usbnet_stop() before it is cleared when dev->flags is set to 0.

2. The problem was identified by Oliver Neukum and the fix was provided by Eugene Shatokhin.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags.

4. In the code changes, a new variable "mpn" is introduced to store the value of !test_and_clear_bit(EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM, &dev->flags) before it is cleared.

5. The patch then uses the "mpn" variable to conditionally execute the code block related to managing power if info->manage_power is true.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to managing power in the usbnet driver. However, without further context or information about the severity of the issue and its impact on system stability or security, it is difficult to determine whether this patch qualifies as a real and critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would need more information to make a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug related to antenna selection when Bluetooth (BT) is active. This bug can cause issues on devices with a single antenna, such as the 3160, where the device couldn't connect at all when BT was active. This qualifies as a real and critical bug.

2. The patch includes a reference to a bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97181), indicating that the issue has been reported and tracked.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug (34c8b24ff284). This helps in identifying the specific change that caused the issue.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Emmanuel Grumbach, who is listed as the maintainer of the relevant code.

5. The patch modifies the code in a way that fixes the bug. It corrects the incorrect antenna selection by using the correct bitmap value (mvm->cfg->non_shared_ant) instead of the incorrect bitmap bit (BIT(mvm->cfg->non_shared_ant)).

6. The patch is targeted for stable releases starting from version 3.17, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in the -stable branch.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be ACKed.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a list corruption issue in urb dequeue at host removal in the xhci driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential bug.

2. The patch description explains that the xhci driver frees data for all devices, including td_list and xhci_ring structures, when usb_remove_hcd() is called for the first time. However, when usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus, it tries to dequeue all pending urbs and accesses td_list, which has already been freed for that endpoint. This indicates a potential issue that could lead to list corruption.

3. The patch includes Cc and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reported and tested by Joe Lawrence.

4. The patch is signed-off by Mathias Nyman and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the xhci_urb_dequeue() function. Specifically, it adds a condition to the for loop that checks if xhci->devs[urb->dev->slot_id] is valid before continuing the loop. This change ensures that the loop only iterates when the device is present, preventing access to freed memory.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to list corruption. It also includes proper testing and review. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds status and return request handlers for the wiimote HID driver. This indicates that it aims to handle status reports and return reports from the wiimote device.

2. The patch mentions that the wiimote resets the current drm (Direct Rendering Manager) when an extension is plugged in. To keep the drm consistent, the patch resets the drm on every status report.

3. The patch also handles return reports from the wiimote, which indicate the success or failure of requests sent to the device.

4. The patch includes the necessary function implementations for handling status and return reports.

5. The patch adds two new request IDs, WIIPROTO_REQ_STATUS and WIIPROTO_REQ_RETURN, to the existing enum wiiproto_reqs.

6. The patch defines the handler functions for the new request IDs, handler_status and handler_return, respectively.

7. The handler_status function resets the drm and calls the existing handler_keys function to handle the status report.

8. The handler_return function calls the existing handler_keys function to handle the return report and displays a warning message if an error occurred.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to the wiimote HID driver and adds necessary functionality to handle status and return reports. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a reported bug by Chris Metcalf, where sched_can_stop_tick() sometimes fails to re-enable the tick. This bug can potentially cause issues such as missed ticks and incorrect scheduling behavior.

2. The patch includes a fix for the observed problem where rq->cfs.nr_running can be 1 even though there are multiple runnable CFS tasks. This issue occurs in the cgroup case, and the patch corrects the calculation of rq->cfs.nr_running.

3. The patch also identifies additional problems with the function sched_can_stop_tick(). It points out that the current implementation assumes that if there are FIFO tasks, those will run, which is incorrect. The patch suggests reordering the checks to correctly handle the case where RR tasks have a higher priority than FIFO tasks.

4. The patch includes proper attribution to the reporter, Chris Metcalf, and has been tested by him as well.

5. The patch is signed-off by multiple maintainers and contributors, indicating their agreement with the proposed fix.

6. The patch includes a link to the original report and references related individuals who may have relevant expertise.

7. The patch is marked as a fix for a specific commit, indicating that it addresses a known issue.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can impact scheduling behavior. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to qeth (QDIO Ethernet) devices on the s390 architecture. The patch aims to ensure that changes to the blkt (block size) default values are retained during online settings.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch addresses a specific issue related to blkt default values being reset during online settings. While it may not be explicitly mentioned as critical, it seems to be a bug that affects the functionality of qeth devices.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not seem to introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real bug without introducing any new issues. However, it is important to note that further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the patch's effectiveness and compatibility with the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a false-positive warning in the dev_pm_domain_set() function. Currently, the WARN_ON() triggers not only on attempts to set the pm_domain pointer but also on attempts to clear it. This leads to false-positive warnings when the bus type code calls dev_pm_domain_set() to clear the pm_domain pointer after invoking the driver's ->remove() callback.

The proposed fix checks if the pointer passed to dev_pm_domain_set() is NULL and skips the warning in that case. This change ensures that false-positive warnings are avoided when clearing the pm_domain pointer.

The patch also includes relevant information such as the commit that introduced the issue (Fixes: 989561de9b51), the author's signed-off-by, and multiple tested-by tags.

Considering that the patch addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is described as a hardening fix that requires read access for controlling terminal. It mentions that write-only access to other users' ttys is usually only given through setgid tty executables.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `tty_open` function and the `tiocsctty` function in the `tty_io.c` file.

3. tty_open Function Changes:
   - The patch adds a check to prevent a process with write-only access to the tty from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal.
   - It explains that many distributions set the group of all ttys to "tty" and grant write-only access to all terminals for setgid tty binaries, which should not imply full privileges on all ttys.
   - It suggests that if old code performs open() on a write-only file descriptor, it might be necessary to also permit this if `inode_permission(inode, MAY_READ) == 0`.

4. tiocsctty Function Changes:
   - The patch adds a check to prevent a process without read access to the tty from setting it as the controlling terminal.
   - It mentions that this check is similar to the one added in `tty_open` and refers to the comment in `tty_open` for more details.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a security concern related to write-only access to ttys and prevents processes without read access from obtaining privileges associated with a controlling terminal. It seems to be a valid hardening fix that could prevent potential security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a supply widget for managing the WM8731 ACTIVE bit. The patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to adjusting the display configuration after setting up the power state in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes a change to update the display configuration after the power state is set, which was previously missing.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or adjustment rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug related to truncating a file in the overlay filesystem (ovl). It suggests adding a check for write access on the underlying inode before truncating the file.

2. The patch also suggests performing the write access check on the lower file (before copy-up) for consistency.

3. The patch includes a test case in the form of a C program that verifies the behavior of the truncate function. It checks if the function fails as expected and if the correct error code (ETXTBSY) is returned.

4. The patch is reported by Aihua Zhang and signed-off by Miklos Szeredi.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to write access checks during file truncation in the overlay filesystem. It also includes a test case to verify the fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and providing a test case.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a mislabeled USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) in the ftdi_sio driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the sendfile(2) system call. The patch addresses a scenario where sendfile(2) can be misused to issue lots of writes into arbitrary file descriptors, making them unkillable. This can result in CPU burn and lockup issues.

The patch adds a test for pending signals into the splice_from_pipe_next() function, allowing the process to become killable when there are always buffers available. This change should fix the lockup issues caused by the do-ton-of-tiny-writes nature of sendfile.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical issue that can lead to lockups and CPU burn, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an off-by-one error when addressing the IOR (Input/Output Control register) in the 104-quad-8 driver in the iio subsystem. The patch correctly adjusts the base offset by adding 1 to the original value.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check for pending work in the vmpressure function. The patch does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not seem to fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the function `xfrm6_find_1stfragopt()` in the IPv6 module. The function may now return an error code, and this patch ensures that the error is properly handled.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the bug. This helps in tracking the bug fix.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author, Ben Hutchings, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch is also acked by Craig Gallek, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch is also signed-off by David S. Miller, who is a well-known maintainer of the Linux kernel networking subsystem.

6. The patch modifies two files: `net/ipv6/xfrm6_mode_ro.c` and `net/ipv6/xfrm6_mode_transport.c`.

7. In both files, the patch adds a check for `hdr_len < 0` after calling `x->type->hdr_offset()`. If `hdr_len` is negative, indicating an error, the function returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug by properly handling errors reported by `xfrm6_find_1stfragopt()`. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "weak" attribute from the declaration of the `memory_block_size_bytes()` function in `drivers/base/memory.c`. This change ensures that a non-weak definition is always preferred over the weak one, regardless of link order.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to preemption in the Intel i915 graphics driver. The patch adds a register to the hardware whitelist and is cherry-picked from a specific commit.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the patch description, it seems that the patch addresses a preemption-related issue, which can potentially cause critical problems in the graphics driver. However, without further information about the specific issue and its impact, it is difficult to assess the severity.

Regarding the trivial fixes, the patch does not appear to contain any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It focuses on adding a register to the hardware whitelist, which suggests that it is not a trivial fix.

Based on the available information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it seems to address a real and critical issue in the graphics driver without containing any trivial fixes. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the specific issue and its impact would be necessary for a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and encapsulation change for the qdisc_skb_cb structure. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a Qualcomm vendor ID to the list in the amba driver. It does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it seems to be a cosmetic change rather than addressing a real issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a memory leak issue caused by dangling references to the request_queue in the s390/dasd driver. The patch removes the assignment of NULL to the gendisk's queue pointer before the put_disk call.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes an issue that can potentially cause resource exhaustion and impact system stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to the OMAP4 platform. The patch adds a check to ensure that the clkctrl_offs value is valid before making a low-level CM call. This check is necessary because if the HWMOD_OMAP4_ZERO_CLKCTRL_OFFSET flag is set, a clkctrl_offs value of 0 is considered valid.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a preventive measure to avoid potential issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to fixed-link PHY registration in the fs_enet driver. The patch ensures that any fixed-link PHY registered using of_phy_register_fixed_link() is properly deregistered and freed on probe errors and driver unbind.

The patch also includes a "Fixes" tag, which references commit bb74d9a4a87b, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by that commit.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to address a potential resource leak and cleanup issue.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the xfrm_state_construct() function. The patch adds a kfree() call to free the memory allocated for the aead algorithm name. 

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix an issue related to inappropriate zone congestion clearing in the vmscan module of the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that the removal of zone watermark checks from the compaction code in kswapd caused the zone congestion clearing to happen unconditionally on higher order reclaim, which disrupts the reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages.

The patch proposes to remove the clearing from the zone compaction section entirely, as the preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd will clear it if the zone is considered balanced.

Considering the nature of the issue being addressed and the proposed solution, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that affects the reclaim throttling logic and can potentially lead to performance issues or data corruption. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, as it addresses a specific and significant problem.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch by kernel maintainers and testing in various scenarios is necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the usage of the IS_ERR() macro and replaces it with a check for NULL. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to accessing registers in the gt power well from userspace. However, the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error that occurs when CONFIG_CPU_HAS_PMU is not selected. This can be considered a real and critical bug as it prevents the build from succeeding in certain configurations. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to false interrupts triggering on UARTs A and B on Tegra chips. This bug can lead to the UART IRQ being disabled and potentially cause issues such as the kernel printing "irq 68: nobody cared" messages.

The patch enables the UART_BUG_NOMSR flag for Tegra chips, which prevents the false interrupts from triggering by disabling UART_IER_MSI. The patch also mentions that this bug has apparently been fixed on Tegra chips after Tegra30 and does not affect UARTs C..E or UARTs A..B if the MODEM control signals are routed out to package pins.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can cause system instability and data corruption, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content and purpose.

The patch is titled "drm/i915/fbdev: Stop repeating tile configuration on stagnation" and is aimed at fixing a bug related to tiled monitor configurations in the Intel i915 graphics driver.

The patch modifies the function `intel_fb_initial_config` in the `intel_fbdev.c` file. It introduces a new variable `conn_seq` and uses it to check if the tile configuration should be applied only on the first pass. If no progress is made in finding matching outputs for a tiled configuration, the patch stops looping over the remaining unconfigured outputs.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to tiled monitor configurations and improves the behavior of the driver in such scenarios. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the issue.

Additionally, the fix seems to be addressing a non-critical optimization issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a situation where association restarts do not consider the state of the socket, potentially creating a condition where a remote system can create a local association that is not reachable by the user. This can occur when outstanding data exists, the local application calls close() on the socket, and the remote tries to create a new association triggering a restart.

2. The patch moves the newly established association into the SHUTDOWN-SENT state and bundles a SHUTDOWN after the COOKIE-ACK chunk. This ensures that the restarted association immediately enters the shutdown procedure, forcing the termination of the unreachable association.

3. The patch includes a reported-by tag and is signed-off by the relevant contributors.

4. Additionally, the patch modifies the SCTP_MAX_NUM_COMMANDS macro in the command.h file, increasing its value from 14 to 20.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to association restarts and ensures the termination of unreachable associations. It also includes a reported-by tag and is signed-off by the relevant contributors. However, the modification of the SCTP_MAX_NUM_COMMANDS macro seems unrelated to the issue being addressed.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), with the suggestion to separate the modification of the SCTP_MAX_NUM_COMMANDS macro into a separate patch, as it does not directly relate to the critical issue being fixed.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific PCI error on the lantiq platform. The patch itself modifies the way controllers are added to the list, using `list_add_tail` instead of `list_add`. This change aims to restore the former order of adding controllers before the specified head.

Since the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to checking the return value of `blk_mq_init_queue` in multiple drivers (`null_blk.c`, `nvme-core.c`, and `virtio_blk.c`). The patch replaces the check `!nullb->q`, `!dev->admin_q`, and `!q` with `IS_ERR(nullb->q)`, `IS_ERR(dev->admin_q)`, and `IS_ERR(q)` respectively.

Since the patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to a build error or memory allocation failure (`-ENOMEM`), it is a valid fix for a real and critical issue. Additionally, the change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, assuming that the interrupt trigger is already properly configured. However, this assumption is not safe to make as some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot.

2. The patch fixes the issue: It forces the IRQ to trigger on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. This ensures that the IRQ is properly configured even on boards where interrupt triggers are disabled.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It introduces a necessary change to fix a potential issue, rather than making trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by the relevant contributors: It has been reviewed and approved by Phoebe Buckheister and David S. Miller, indicating that it has undergone the necessary scrutiny.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to IRQ setup, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup and optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch removes the invocation of `intel_pstate_update_perf_limits()` from `intel_cpufreq_verify_policy()`, which is described as unnecessary and confusing. It also mentions that this change does not affect the per-CPU limits case.

Since the patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (code cleanup and optimization), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the wm8994 codec driver where enum controls (DRC Mode and EQ Mode) are accessed incorrectly using `value.integer.value[]` instead of `value.enumerated.item[]`. This incorrect access can lead to potential bugs or issues in the driver.

The patch fixes this issue by changing the access to `value.enumerated.item[]` for both `wm8994_put_drc_enum()` and `wm8994_put_retune_mobile_enum()` functions.

This fix is not a trivial change as it corrects a potential bug that could impact the functionality of the driver. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Therefore, considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause issues in the driver, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic issue in the netxen_nic_poll() function. The patch ensures that the poller returns the budget value when it wants to be called again, even if the driver limits TX completion. 

The patch also includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, tested, and reviewed the fix. 

Considering the patch addresses a logic issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a critical bug related to the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in MCG paravirtualization. The issue arises when a client re-register event triggers the cleanup of all MCGs. However, since the cleanup is performed in a work queue, there is a possibility that the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) could leave and re-join groups before the cleanup occurs. This leads to the cleanup pruning the newly-joined MCGs, leaving the ULP without the actual MCGs while believing it joined them.

To fix this issue, the patch sets the flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clears it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup occurs correctly and prevents the ULP from losing the joined MCGs.

The patch includes the necessary code changes in the mlx4_ib_mcg_port_cleanup function and introduces a new structure, clean_work, and a new task, mcg_clean_task, to handle the cleanup process.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and incorrect behavior. It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving the issue at hand. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a quirk to avoid setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE on certain machines, specifically Dell XPS 13 models. This is done because these machines suffer from non-functional backlight controls if BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE is set.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the i915 driver to apply the quirk. It adds a new quirk flag QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE and a corresponding function quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable() to set the flag.

3. The patch also updates the intel_quirks[] array in intel_display.c to include the Dell XPS13 models and the quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable() function.

4. Finally, the patch modifies the intel_panel_enable_backlight() function in intel_panel.c to check for the QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE flag before setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue with backlight controls on Dell XPS 13 models and provides a quirk to avoid the problem. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes skb allocation failure warnings. These warnings were triggering a page allocation warning, which is already handled. Removing these warnings will help avoid unnecessary noise in the logs.

2. One of the warnings was not ratelimited, which means it was not limited in frequency. This could cause the system to lock up under heavy traffic and low memory conditions. Removing this warning is crucial for maintaining system stability.

3. The patch removes a printk_ratelimited call in the cvm_oct_napi_poll function. This call was printing a warning message when skb allocation failed. Removing this warning message will prevent unnecessary log entries and improve system performance.

Overall, the patch addresses issues related to skb allocation failure warnings and improves system stability under heavy traffic and low memory conditions. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix a bug where local routes are mistakenly deleted when the fib_netdev_event function calls fib_disable_ip on the NETDEV_DOWN event. The issue arises because both fib_netdev_event and fib_inetaddr_event use the NETDEV_DOWN constant. The patch fixes this by returning the variable 'force' in the fib_disable_ip function.

2. Fixes:
   The patch references the commit 8a3d03166f19, which is related to tracking link-status of IPv4 nexthops.

3. Analysis:
   The patch modifies the fib_disable_ip function by adding a new parameter 'force' and using it to conditionally call fib_sync_down_dev. The 'force' parameter is used to determine whether the local routes should be deleted or not. The patch also updates the calls to fib_disable_ip in fib_inetaddr_event and fib_netdev_event to pass the 'force' parameter accordingly.

   The patch includes changes in the following files:
   - net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c
   - net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c

4. Impact:
   The patch addresses a specific issue where local routes are incorrectly deleted. It does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend marking this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

4. The patch includes the necessary error handling and returns `-ENXIO` if the allocation fails.

Based on the above analysis, the patch addresses potential concurrency issues when modifying the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree and ensures exclusive access during the allocation process. It also includes proper error handling. Therefore, it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a regression that occurred in Linux 3.18+ for the implementation of drm_vblank_on. The issue arises when the user specifies a value of zero for drm_vblank_offdelay, which should always re-enable vblank interrupts in the drm_vblank_on function. However, a kms driver could override this choice by setting vblank_disable_immediate to true.

The patch fixes this regression and ensures that the user's choice is respected. It modifies the condition in the drm_vblank_on function to re-enable vblank interrupts if there are still clients left or if the user has requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Mario Kleiner and Daniel Vetter. It also includes relevant Cc's and a stable tag.

Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the behavior of vblank interrupts, which can impact graphics performance and functionality. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

If `skb->encapsulation` is set, the patch adds the size of the inner network headers to the segment length calculation. Additionally, if the GSO type is TCP, it adds the size of the inner TCP header as well.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than fixing a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning generated by gcc 4.1.2, indicating a comparison that is always false due to the limited range of the data type.

2. The patch addresses the issue by introducing an intermediate variable of type int to store the return value of f81534_logic_to_phy_port().

3. The patch also modifies the error handling logic by forwarding the actual error code instead of converting it to -ENODEV. Additionally, it removes the unnecessary check for F81534_NUM_PORT, as the callee always returns a valid port number in case of success.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear indication of the problem being addressed.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Geert Uytterhoeven and Johan Hovold, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the UDF (Universal Disk Format) filesystem, which can lead to data corruption when converting file types. The race condition occurs when two O_APPEND writes are performed concurrently, and if the combined size of the writes exceeds the inode capacity, it can result in overwriting kernel buffers beyond the inode.

To fix this issue, the patch introduces a mutex lock on the inode before checking whether the write fits into the inode. Additionally, it replaces the use of `generic_file_aio_write()` with `__generic_file_aio_write()`, which combines the check and write operations into one critical section.

The patch also includes a fix in `udf_expand_file_adinicb()` function to ensure that the inode mutex is locked before expanding the file's allocation descriptor in the case of short AD (Allocation Descriptor).

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch ensures that if `ieee80211_vif_use_channel()` fails, the `sdata->radar_required` field is cleared to prevent stale values and enable new scan requests.

The patch also includes a reported-by tag and is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real and critical issue related to a corrupted file system. The patch introduces a new function called `ext4_iget_normal()` which is used for directory tree lookups. This function prohibits the use of directory entries that point at reserved, metadata inodes, similar to how Boot Loader inodes are treated. These reserved inodes are marked as bad inodes, preventing them from being opened, deleted, or modified.

The patch also includes modifications in the `ext4_iget()` function to handle the new `ext4_iget_normal()` function. Additionally, it updates the `ext4_lookup()` and `ext4_get_parent()` functions to use `ext4_iget_normal()` instead of `ext4_iget()`.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical issue related to data corruption and ensures the proper handling of reserved inodes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the UBI (Unsorted Block Images) driver. The patch corrects the use of "VID" vs. "EC" in the header self-check computation of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

7. The patch modifies the function `i915_gem_reset_engine` in the `i915_gem.c` file.

8. Within the function, a new variable `flags` of type `unsigned long` is introduced.

9. The function first checks if the engine has an `irq_seqno_barrier` and returns early if it does.

10. The function then checks if the incomplete context is the default context and returns early if it is.

11. The patch introduces locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent modifications to the timeline and the list of requests on the timeline.

12. The `timeline` variable is assigned the result of a call to `i915_gem_context_lookup_timeline` with the `incomplete_ctx` and `engine` as arguments.

13. The `spin_lock_irqsave` function is called to acquire the lock on `engine->timeline->lock` and save the interrupt state in `flags`.

14. The `spin_lock` function is called to acquire the lock on `timeline->lock`.

15. A loop is then used to iterate over the requests on the `engine->timeline->requests` list. If a request's context matches the `incomplete_ctx`, the `reset_request` function is called on that request.

16. Another loop is used to iterate over the requests on the `timeline->requests` list, and the `reset_request` function is called on each request.

17. The `spin_unlock` function is called to release the lock on `timeline->lock`.

18. The `spin_unlock_irqrestore` function is called to release the lock on `engine->timeline->lock` and restore the interrupt state from `flags`.

19. The function `i915_gem_reset` is defined but not modified by this patch.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific bug related to preventing modifications to the list of requests on the timeline while it is being walked. It introduces necessary locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity during the reset process. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a situation where the mac80211 state machine gets confused due to a failure in scheduling the CSA (Channel Switch Announcement) time event. This confusion can lead to an unstable connection.

The patch handles this situation by disconnecting the affected interface if the CSA time event fails to start. This approach ensures that the mac80211 state machine is not left in an inconsistent state.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that can impact the stability and reliability of wireless connections using the iwlwifi driver.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue where the ramp delay for buck4 was accidentally enabled when setting ramp delay for unsupported bucks (buck[56789] and buck10).

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author and reviewed by another developer.

4. The code change checks if the regulator is buck[1234] before enabling the ramp delay. If it is not, the ramp delay is not enabled.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue where the ramp delay was accidentally enabled for an unsupported buck, which could potentially cause unexpected behavior or instability. The patch is well-documented and reviewed, and the code change ensures that the ramp delay is only enabled for the supported bucks.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that restricted a virtual function (VF) from configuring any VLAN mode. The reason for reverting this restriction is to allow the same multicast address to be used with any VLAN, saving multicast filters.

However, the patch also removes code that checks for specific MAC operations (QLC_MAC_STAR_ADD and QLC_MAC_STAR_DEL) and returns an error if these operations are detected. Without this check, it is possible for a VF to configure MAC + any VLAN filters, which may have unintended consequences.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a feature change or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to PM runtime management for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. It explains that enabling the default PM Domain using PM_CLK can prevent the registration of the real Clock Domain from DT later.

2. The patch proposes not enabling the default PM Domain in the mentioned scenarios and suggests using the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain driver for PM runtime management of the module clocks.

3. The patch also mentions that most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms now use DT-based PM Domains for PM runtime management, simplifying the platform logic by replacing explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT.

4. Backwards compatibility with old DTs is ensured by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags.

6. The code changes in the patch seem to be well-structured and focused on addressing the specific issue without introducing any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to PM runtime management and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The commit being reverted is 23c405912b88.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the following criteria:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? - The patch is reverting a previous fix for a memory leak. If the original fix was indeed addressing a real and critical bug, then reverting it would reintroduce the bug. However, without further information about the original fix, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? - The patch itself does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? - The patch only removes a kfree() call for par_dev->state. Without additional context, it is unclear whether this removal is trivial or not.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, if the original fix for the memory leak was indeed addressing a real and critical bug, it is likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it would reintroduce the bug.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug that was exposed by a previous commit, which attempted to fix an oversight related to obj->map_and_fenceable computation.
2. The bug violates the change introduced in the previous patch, which sets map_and_fenceable to true only when the object is bound into the global GTT.
3. The proposed solution in the patch is to unbind from the global GTT if the object is currently fenceable but will not be after the tiling change.
4. The patch includes a Bugzilla reference, a testcase, and has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone thorough testing and review.
5. The change introduced by the patch is not a trivial fix, as it addresses a critical bug related to tiling changes and the computation of obj->map_and_fenceable.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the mvneta driver. It removes the direct call to mvneta_adjust_link() from the mvneta_ioctl() function and instead relies on the callback mechanism provided by of_phy_connect(). 

Calling mvneta_adjust_link() directly is incorrect because it is intended to be called as a callback from of_phy_connect(). By removing this direct call, the patch ensures that the callback mechanism is used correctly.

The change itself is not a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic and removing a direct function call. It does not involve any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Since the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the code correctness, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a workaround for a specific hardware issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the enabling of the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt in the ravb driver. The commit message states that the driver does not handle this interrupt, so it should not be enabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about the impact of not handling the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue and whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers to understand the impact and criticality of not handling this interrupt.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to releasing overlays in the OMAPFB driver. The patch ensures that overlays are properly removed from overlay managers, preventing crashes when omapfb is unbound and bound or when the omapfb module is removed and loaded while keeping omapdss around.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause crashes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the dmi_scan module related to handling the "End of Table" structure. The issue arises after adding initial SMBIOS v3 support, where the type 127 entry is not handled anymore, resulting in it not being created in the dmi sysfs. This is problematic because the size of the entire DMI table must correspond to the sum of all DMI entry sizes.

The patch moves the end-of-table check after it is handled by the dmi_table function, ensuring that the "End of Table" entry is properly created in the dmi sysfs.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Ivan Khoronzhuk and Matt Fleming. It also has a Reviewed-by tag from Ard Biesheuvel. The patch is targeted for the stable branch (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org).

Considering that the patch addresses a real bug that can potentially lead to incorrect DMI table sizes, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a small race condition between `copy_process()` and `cgroup_attach_task()`, where `child->se.parent` and `cfs_rq` may point to invalid (old) ones.
2. The worst-case scenario of this bug can lead to a "use-after-free" situation and cause a panic, as the old cgroup and related data can be freed before accessing them.
3. The bug has already caused a panic in RHEL6.4, indicating its severity.
4. The patch includes a fix that ensures the `child->se.parent` and `cfs_rq` point to valid ones by calling `__set_task_cpu()` after the copy process.
5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and other relevant individuals.
6. The patch has been submitted to the stable mailing list for consideration.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that can lead to a panic at kfree in mei_release(). The bug occurs when mei_cl_read_start() fails to send a flow control request and releases "cl->read_cb" without setting it to NULL. This leaves "cl->read_cb" pointing to random memory, which can cause issues when the client is operated later.

The patch fixes this bug by setting "cl->read_cb" to NULL before releasing it. This ensures that the pointer is not left pointing to invalid memory.

Considering that the bug can lead to a panic and the patch addresses the issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a panic, which meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the error passive level test in the pch_can driver. The patch modifies the condition for checking whether the receive error counter has reached the error passive level.

The original condition (((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) > 127) is incorrect because the receive error counter is limited to a maximum value of 127. The patch suggests using the RP bit (15) instead to determine if the error passive level has been reached.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a potential bug in the driver, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a regression issue in the mtd/gpmi driver. The regression causes the inability to mount the ubifs created by the old NAND ECC layout. The patch reverts to the legacy ECC layout to address this issue.

Since the regression affects the functionality of the driver and prevents the mounting of ubifs, it can be considered a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to fix a critical issue related to I2C transfer hangs on certain devices. The issue is resolved by reducing the internal frequency of the TWI IP. The patch does not impact the I2C bus frequency.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes hangs during I2C frame transmission, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a whitelist of PHY compatibilities to address confusion between PHYs and generic MDIO devices. It also issues a warning if a compatible value known on the whitelist is found, indicating that it should be removed.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential confusion and provides a warning for incompatible values, it can be considered a valid fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to information leakage in the L2CAP code of the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch initializes the `l2_bdaddr_type` member of `struct sockaddr_l2` and the padding byte for alignment, which prevents the leakage of two bytes of kernel stack memory via the `getsockname()` syscall.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information leakage, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue in the reiserfs filesystem. The patch addresses the problem of not freeing the commit workqueue when mount fails, which can lead to resource leaks.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can cause resource leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a regression caused by a previous patch that reverted code necessary for handling dirty pages. The patch ensures that the lower file is still open before writing out the dirty pages. It also includes a link to a bug report and has been tested by multiple individuals.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug related to data corruption. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a generic quirk for matching Insyde devices in the bytcr_rt5640 driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of MTU constraints in vxlan devices without an underlying device. Previously, their MTUs were limited to the conventional ethernet value of 1500, which prevented them from taking advantage of jumbo frames and larger MTU sizes.

The patch allows the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to be set to larger values, up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead. It introduces the function __vxlan_change_mtu, which calculates the maximum MTU based on the lowerdev's MTU and adjusts the new MTU accordingly. If the new MTU exceeds the maximum, it is either rejected (if strict mode is enabled) or adjusted to the maximum allowed value.

The patch also modifies the vxlan_change_mtu function to utilize __vxlan_change_mtu, passing the necessary parameters.

Overall, this patch addresses a limitation in vxlan devices and allows them to support larger MTU sizes, improving their flexibility and compatibility with jumbo frames. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a registration failure in the s5p-g2d driver. The failure causes a boot warning and prevents the G2D driver from registering the video device. This issue can be considered a real and critical bug as it affects the functionality of the driver.

The patch itself adds a missing assignment to the v4l2_dev field in the video_device structure. This fix ensures that the v4l2_dev field is properly set, as expected by the commit mentioned in the patch description.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to data corruption on termios updates for PL2303 devices. It explains that some PL2303 devices lose bytes when serial settings are changed, even if the new settings are the same as the previous ones. This issue can be triggered by repeatedly requesting a specific baud rate using the TCSETS2-interface.

The patch compares the encoded settings with the previously used ones before configuring the device, preventing the data corruption issue. It introduces a new member, `line_settings`, in the `pl2303_private` structure to store the previous settings.

The patch also includes a comment explaining the need for the filtering in this specific case and clarifies that the previous check (`tty_termios_hw_change`) is not sufficient to handle the baud rate differences.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the preparation of a port STP update in the net/dsa/slave.c file. The issue is that a driver may return -EOPNOTSUPP from the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev. This issue has been reported by Andrew Lunn and the patch has been reviewed and Acked by him.

The patch modifies the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function by introducing the variables `p` and `ds` to access the parent switch and slave private data. It also modifies the logic for handling SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE attribute. Instead of directly calling `dsa_slave_stp_update`, it checks if the switch driver supports port_stp_update and returns -EOPNOTSUPP if it doesn't. Otherwise, it calls the driver's port_stp_update function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW accessing the freed buffers, potentially causing a host crash. The patch addresses this by deregistering the MR in the firmware (FW) before freeing the fast_reg_page_list.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential crash issue and ensures proper memory management, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the powerpc/eeh subsystem. The patch replaces the use of `list_for_each_entry()` with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe traversal of the EEH devices list, as devices may be removed from their parent PE during iteration.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or instability, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the missing xcopy_pt_cmd->sense_buffer[] in the target_core_xcopy.c file. The patch adds the necessary sense_buffer and updates the target_xcopy_read_source() and target_xcopy_write_destination() functions to correctly handle CHECK_CONDITION exceptions.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my decision is (A) to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug reported by Stéphane Marchesin, which caused corruption on the display and reference counting issues. The bug was introduced in a previous commit that mistakenly zapped the pinned fences even though they were in use.

The patch restores the fences for pinned objects after resume and GPU resets, ensuring that the display corruption and reference counting issues are resolved. It introduces the function `i915_gem_restore_fences` in `i915_gem.c` and calls it in relevant places such as `i915_gem_reset` and `i915_gem_load`.

The patch also includes necessary headers and updates the `i915_suspend.c` file to call `i915_gem_restore_fences` during state restoration.

Overall, this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause display corruption and reference counting issues, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to a memory access violation in the pch_uart driver. The patch ensures that the DMA channel is allocated when necessary, preventing the memory access violation.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and potential system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing an explicit call to `plane->destroy` from the `crtc`'s destroy function in the `omap_crtc_destroy` function. The reason for this removal is that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework, so the explicit call is no longer necessary.

The patch also mentions that the removal of the call fixes a crash caused by double freeing the plane.

Given this information, it appears that the patch is addressing a real bug that could potentially cause a crash. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a comment explaining the scenario where an RPC client's dentries may not be held by anyone except the notification callback after the MOUNT event.
2. The patch sets the per-net PipeFS superblock before sending the MOUNT notification for the RPC client.
3. If the MOUNT notification fails, the patch jumps to the "err_depopulate" label and calls the RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification.
4. Finally, the patch sets the "pipefs_sb" field of the "sn" structure to NULL and calls the "__rpc_depopulate" function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific scenario related to RPC client dentries and the per-net PipeFS superblock. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" since it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c file.

2. The patch description explains that rep_data is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Tested-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

4. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the wacom_retrieve_report_data() function.

5. In the original code, rep_data[0] is used as an index to retrieve a value from the rep_data array. However, since rep_data is no longer an array, this indexing is incorrect.

6. The patch corrects this issue by passing rep_data instead of &rep_data[0] as an argument to wacom_get_report().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c file. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to dropped Rx data in the spi-topcliff-pch driver. The patch modifies the pch_spi_handler_sub function to correctly handle the transfer complete interrupt.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a bug in the rtl8821ae driver that causes an undefined behavior warning during compilation. The warning is related to a loop that iterates from 0 to 3, but the array it writes to, `bb_swing_idx_ofdm`, only has two members. This results in overwriting the last two iterations of the loop.

Although the bug itself may not have a significant impact on functionality, it is still a valid bug that should be fixed. The proposed patch changes the size of the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/i915/gen9: Add WaFbcTurnOffFbcWatermark." According to the bspec (presumably the Intel Graphics Programmer's Reference Manual), this patch aims to prevent screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch adds a new workaround named "WaFbcTurnOffFbcWatermark" to the gen9_init_clock_gating function in the intel_pm.c file. It writes a value to the DISP_ARB_CTL register to disable the FBC watermark.

However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the DMA debug API related to handling multiple mappings of the same buffer. The problem was that the debug_dma_mapping_error function was not correctly setting the map_err_type field when multiple mappings existed for a buffer.

The patch resolves this issue by updating the search algorithm in debug_dma_mapping_error to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address and is currently in the MAP_ERR_NOT_CHECKED state. This ensures that the map_err_type field is correctly set for all relevant mappings.

Additionally, the patch mentions a secondary side effect where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type if multiple buffers use the same address. However, this behavior is considered preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Shuah Khan and Joerg Roedel. It also has the necessary sign-offs from Alexander Duyck, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided solution, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

This can lead to a sequence break and lock-up.

The patch removes the setting of EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE after the IDMAC interrupt and suggests that it should be set after the DTO interrupt is generated. This change aims to ensure that the data transfer is completed before allowing the next request to proceed.

Considering the patch addresses a real issue that can potentially cause a lock-up, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the ARM architecture in the net module of the Linux kernel. The patch addresses an issue where the emit_udiv() function is called with rn == ARM_R0 (r_scratch), and loading rm first into ARM_R0 results in the jit_udiv() function being called with the same dividend and divisor. To fix this, the patch suggests loading rn first into ARM_R1 and then rm into ARM_R0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

The bug causes the SP to remain open indefinitely, preventing the opening of new SPs and the response to poll frames from the client. This can lead to a loss of functionality and potential issues with data transmission.

The patch addresses this issue by manually clearing the WLAN_STA_SP flag when a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU session. This ensures that even though the client may not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that can impact the functionality and performance of the mac80211 module.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread. The patch introduces changes to make the usb-stor-scan thread freezable without actually freezing, allowing other threads waiting for scanning to finish to no longer be blocked. It achieves this by requesting a fake signal when freezing and using interruptible sleep to wake the thread early when freezing happens.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to freezing and potential hangs, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Killer E2500 device ID in the alx driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to CPU load average increase caused by the SENSE_PORT command in the mlx4_core driver. The patch suggests using wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() instead of wait_for_completion_timeout() to put the thread in the interruptible state, which does not contribute to the CPU load average.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a real and critical bug that can impact system performance, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a critical issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Additionally, the patch has been suggested by multiple contributors, which adds credibility to its importance and effectiveness.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review and testing of the patch should be conducted to ensure its correctness and compatibility with the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a specific issue in the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the nau8825 codec. It fixes an incorrect configuration of the clk_ref_div in the Pre-Scalar of the FLL (Frequency-Locked Loop) register.

Looking at the code changes, it appears that the clk_ref_div value is being assigned directly to the NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK field. However, the correct behavior should be to shift the clk_ref_div value by NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT before assigning it to the field.

The patch correctly modifies the code to include the necessary shift operation:

```
regmap_update_bits(nau8825->regmap, NAU8825_REG_FLL4,
                   NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK,
                   fll_param->clk_ref_div << NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT);
```

This change ensures that the clk_ref_div value is correctly configured in the Pre-Scalar of the FLL register.

Based on the provided information, this patch seems to fix a specific bug related to incorrect configuration in the ASoC driver for the nau8825 codec. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a real issue that could potentially impact the functionality of the device.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) feature in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to improve the efficiency of checking for memory poisoning in the memory_is_poisoned_16() function.

The patch suggests that if the memory is aligned on 8 bytes, the shadow only takes 2 bytes, and therefore, there is no need to call memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15). However, the patch incorrectly uses the condition "if (likely(!last_byte))" to determine if the last byte is aligned, which is incorrect.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be an optimization and correctness improvement for the KASAN feature.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in a Linux -stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the assignment of the "max_sync" variable in the md/raid10 driver. The patch addresses a complaint from Clang about assigning a variable to itself and suggests using the "bad_sectors" variable instead.

The patch also mentions that the bug has been present since 3.1-rc1 and although it is considered minor, it could potentially cause corruption or other undesirable behavior.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and potentially critical issue that could lead to data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the primary plane in the Intel DRM driver. The bug occurs when the reconstruction of the BIOS framebuffer fails, resulting in a mismatch between the plane state and the actual framebuffer. This mismatch can cause issues with the watermark code and potentially lead to other problems.

The patch addresses this issue by disabling the primary plane and pretending that the BIOS never had it enabled. This is done by setting the primary plane's visibility to false, updating the plane mask, and calling the `intel_pre_disable_primary()` function to disable the plane.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to functional issues and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the credit return threshold adjustment on mtu change algorithm in the IB/hfi1 driver. The patch ensures that the credit return thresholds are adjusted correctly for all allocated and assigned kernel send contexts based on the MTU adjustment per VL.

The patch also includes changes to the pio send context map and the set_threshold function in the pio.c file to dynamically update the credit return threshold values for all remapped kernel send contexts when the number of operational vls changes.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug and improves the functionality of the IB/hfi1 driver, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an off-by-one error in the handling of continuation in /proc/net/route. The error causes the first entry to be skipped when doing a continuation read. The patch addresses this issue by fixing the off-by-one calculation when acquiring the position on continuation.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a bug related to the generation of /proc/net/route output.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow issue in the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE calculation. This issue arises when ASLR is disabled and PIE binaries fail to map shadow memory for AddressSanitizer (ASan) due to the overflow.

2. The patch fixes the overflow by dividing TASK_SIZE before multiplying, ensuring that ELF_ET_DYN_BASE is calculated correctly.

3. The reported issue affects the compatibility of ASan with PIE binaries, making it important to fix for proper functionality.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, including the original author and the maintainer of the ARM architecture.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and ensure the proper functioning of ASan with PIE binaries.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a deadlock issue between rmmod and set_mode functions in the IB/ipoib driver.
2. The deadlock occurs due to a lock acquisition order mismatch between sys/fs lock and rtnl_lock.
3. The problem arises when ipoib_set_mod frees its rtnl_lock and tries to acquire it again.
4. The call flow for set_mode acquires the sys/fs lock first and then tries to acquire rtnl_lock.
5. On the other hand, the call flow for rmmod acquires rtnl_lock first and then tries to acquire the sys/fs lock.
6. This lock acquisition order mismatch leads to a deadlock situation.
7. The patch modifies the set_mode function to check if ipoib_set_mode returned -EBUSY, indicating that the rtnl_lock is still held.
8. If rtnl_lock is still held, the patch avoids unlocking it and returns -EBUSY.
9. Otherwise, it unlocks rtnl_lock before returning.
10. The patch also includes the necessary Fixes tag and Signed-off-by tags.

Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock, which qualifies it for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "v4l2-compat-ioctl32: fix alignment for ARM64". It suggests that the patch aims to fix an alignment issue specific to ARM64 architecture.

2. The patch includes changes to the struct `v4l2_standard32`. It replaces the `id` field, which was an array of two `__u32` elements, with a single `compat_u64` element. This change ensures proper alignment on ARM64 kernels without breaking compatibility on AMD64.

3. The patch also modifies the `put_v4l2_standard32` function to use `put_user` instead of `copy_to_user` for the `id` field. This change aligns with the new `compat_u64` type used in the struct.

4. Additionally, the patch includes changes to the struct `v4l2_input32`. It replaces the `std` field, which was of type `v4l2_std_id`, with a `compat_u64` type. This change ensures proper alignment on ARM64 kernels.

5. The patch also removes the `__attribute__ ((packed))` attribute from the `v4l2_input32` struct. This change suggests that the struct should no longer be packed.

6. Finally, the patch includes changes to the struct `v4l2_event32`. It adds a new field `compat_s64 value64` to the union `u`. This change introduces compatibility for 64-bit values in the `v4l2_event32` struct.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix an alignment issue specific to ARM64 architecture in the v4l2-compat-ioctl32 module. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to address a specific issue related to the flush_tlb_range() function. The patch suggests adding the ->page_table_lock when the ->mmap_sem is not held, as other callers already hold either ->mmap_sem (exclusive) or ->page_table_lock.

The patch provides some explanation for the need of ->page_table_lock in certain scenarios, such as arch/powerpc/mm/tlb_hash32.c and uml. It also mentions that almost all other callers are already fine.

Given this information, it seems that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug related to the flush_tlb_range() function. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves adding a lock and provides justification for its necessity.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference crash on POWER7 systems when trying to allocate an HPT in the case where no HPTs were preallocated. This bug can cause a hang or data corruption, which qualifies it as a real and critical issue.

The patch modifies the `kvm_alloc_linear` function by introducing a separate variable `ret` to store the return value from the loop iterator. This ensures that the correct value is returned and avoids the NULL pointer dereference crash.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to semaphore values in the DRM Radeon driver. The patch changes the data type of the `cpu_addr` variable from `uint32_t*` to `uint64_t*`, indicating that the semaphore values have 64 bits instead of 32 bits.

This change is necessary to ensure proper synchronization when the upper 32 bits of the semaphore value are not zero. Without this fix, there could be a subtle bug that disables synchronization.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to synchronization issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Additionally, the patch includes appropriate sign-offs and has been reviewed by relevant individuals, which adds to its credibility.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real issue: The split_huge_pages function does not support the get method, so the read permission is confusing. Changing the permission to write-only makes it more appropriate.

2. The patch also improves readability: It adds a newline character ("\n") to the output of the set method, making it more readable.

3. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Kirill A. Shutemov, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real issue and improve the code's clarity without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a potential issue with bricking machines due to writing too much data to UEFI variables. The patch adds a module parameter and a config option to disable the use of efivars as a backend for pstore, which can potentially be a large data source.

Considering the potential impact on system stability and the fact that it addresses a real and critical issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It provides a way to mitigate the risk of bricking machines and allows users to disable the use of efivars as a pstore backend if needed.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch code and testing should be conducted to ensure its correctness and effectiveness in addressing the issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to address an issue in the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() function and the tcp_v6_md5_do_add() function, which handle the addition of TCP MD5 signatures for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively.

2. The patch modifies the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() function to only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first TCP MD5 signature peer. This change ensures that multiple TCP MD5 signature peers do not hold multiple references to md5sig_pool.

3. Similarly, the patch modifies the tcp_v6_md5_do_add() function to also only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first TCP MD5 signature peer.

4. The patch also includes changes to handle memory allocation failures and freeing of resources in case of errors.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to handling TCP MD5 signatures and ensures proper reference counting of md5sig_pool.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a use-after-free bug in the mac80211 module related to defragmentation. The bug occurs when the last fragment is received, and all but the first fragment are freed. However, the multicast check for statistics at the end of the function refers to the current skb (the last fragment), causing a use-after-free bug.

The patch modifies the check for multicast frames to also include the accounting, fixing the issue. It also includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags.

Considering the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which aligns with the criteria for acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to screen corruption with FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) on Skylake (skl) and Kaby Lake (kbl) platforms. The patch adds a workaround called "WaFbcNukeOnHostModify" by setting the ILK_DPFC_NUKE_ON_ANY_MODIFICATION flag in the ILK_DPFC_CHICKEN register.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug: Yes, it aims to prevent screen corruption with FBC on skl and kbl platforms.

2. The bug is critical: It is not explicitly mentioned whether the bug is critical or not. We need to refer to the provided references (HSD#2227109, HSDES#1404569388) to determine the severity of the bug.

3. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: The patch aims to prevent screen corruption, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on adding the necessary workaround.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue and does not contain trivial fixes. However, without further information about the severity of the bug, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make a final decision, we would need more context and information about the severity of the bug and its impact on the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation uses a static variable `hidg_desc` to store the HID descriptor, which can be overwritten if multiple instances of the `hid` function are used. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential issues.

2. The patch fixes the bug by creating a copy of the `hidg_desc` variable in the `hidg_setup` function. This ensures that each instance of the `hid` function has its own copy of the HID descriptor, preventing any overwriting issues.

3. The patch also updates the HID descriptor copy to correctly set the descriptor type and length for the HID_DT_REPORT case in the `hidg_setup` function.

4. In the `hidg_bind` function, the patch adds a comment clarifying that the `hidg_desc` struct can be used but its content should not be relied upon to remain unchanged after returning from the function. This is a helpful clarification for future developers.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that can lead to incorrect behavior and provides a proper fix for it. It does not contain any trivial changes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can lead to errors and failures during the initialization of the network device.

3. Signed-off-by: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>
   The patch is signed off by Mike Snitzer, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 3.10+,drivers/md/dm-thin.c
   The patch is marked for consideration in the stable kernel releases, specifically for versions 3.10 and above, and it is relevant to the "dm-thin" driver in the "drivers/md" directory.

5. Code changes:
   - Line 3201: The patch modifies the error handling in the "pool_ctr" function. Instead of jumping to "out_free_pt" label, it now jumps to "out_flags_changed" label.
   - Line 3204: The patch adds a callback function, "pool_is_congested," to the "callbacks" structure.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a bug related to reference count decrement in the error path of the "pool_ctr" function. It also includes relevant metadata threshold event generation and callback additions. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this bug is critical or if it causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

To make a final decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for setting the default hoplimit to zero in IPv6. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The commit message explains that the patch modifies the hoplimit checking condition and default value in `ip6_dst_hoplimit`, but it does not zero all hoplimit default values.

2. The patch sets `ip6_template_metrics[RTAX_HOPLIMIT - 1]` to zero, which forces it to be a constant value. This change is necessary due to a previous commit that forces `dst_default_metrics` to the const section.

3. The patch also modifies the `dst_metric_set` function call in `icmp6_dst_alloc` to set the hoplimit to zero.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real issue by correctly setting the default hoplimit to zero in IPv6. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential problem that could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to holding the tunnel socket when handling control frames in l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6. The patch ensures that a new reference is held on the socket, preventing a reference drop from the tunnel's socket.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a crash when running with ftrace enabled. This crash is caused by a stack overflow in the resume_kernel function.

2. The stack overflow leads to corruption of the thread_info structure and sets the _TIF_EMULATE_STACK_STORE flag.

3. The patch fixes the issue by ensuring that DISABLE_INTS is called before RUNLATCH_ON, which reconciles the irq state in the paca with the hardware and makes it safe to call local_irq_save/restore().

4. Additionally, the patch marks the runlatch routines as notrace to avoid unnecessary tracing overhead.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and is targeted for stable releases starting from v3.4+.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch and description, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug related to dynamic metrics allocation in the IPv6 code. The patch creates the metrics array in the `ipv6_cow_metrics()` function, which was previously assuming that only `DST_HOST` routes require dynamic metrics allocation from `inetpeer`. However, this assumption breaks when an ndisc discovered router has `RTAX_MTU` and `RTAX_HOPLIMIT` metrics.

The patch includes a test case that demonstrates the issue before and after applying the patch. The test case shows that the patch successfully adds the `mtu` and `hoplimit` metrics to the routes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug related to dynamic metrics allocation in the IPv6 code.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the Intel Valleyview SoC's SATA device sleep functionality.

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) frame transmission in multiple buffers.

2. The patch modifies the `cp_start_xmit` function in the `8139cp.c` file.

3. The patch adds the `ctrl` variable to store the control flags for the descriptor.

4. The patch updates the control flags based on the conditions. If the `mss` (Maximum Segment Size) is non-zero, it sets the `LargeSend` flag and includes the `mss` value in the control flags. If the `skb->ip_summed` is `CHECKSUM_PARTIAL`, it sets the appropriate checksum flags based on the IP protocol.

5. The patch assigns the updated control flags to the `opts1` field of the descriptor.

6. The patch ensures proper memory ordering with the use of memory barriers (`wmb()`).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to TSO frame transmission and ensures correct descriptor setup. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the "rq_wq" member from the "rbd_device" structure and replaces it with a new "rbd_wq" workqueue for all devices. This change aims to use a single workqueue for all devices instead of one queue per device.

2. The "rbd_request_fn" function is modified to use the new "rbd_wq" workqueue instead of the per-device "rq_wq" workqueue when queuing work.

3. The "rbd_dev_device_setup" function no longer allocates a per-device workqueue ("rq_wq") and instead adds the device to the "rbd_wq" workqueue. The error handling code is adjusted accordingly.

4. The "rbd_dev_device_release" function no longer destroys the per-device workqueue ("rq_wq") since it is no longer used.

5. The "__init rbd_init" function now allocates the new "rbd_wq" workqueue and assigns it to the "rbd_wq" variable. If the allocation fails, it returns an error.

6. The "__exit rbd_exit" function now destroys the "rbd_wq" workqueue.

Based on the analysis, this patch seems to be a reasonable change that simplifies the code by using a single workqueue for all devices instead of one per device. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the detection of RAPL domains in the powercap/intel_rapl.c driver. The current detection message is misleading and can be annoying for users, as it suggests a failure even though it is expected behavior for many CPUs not to support the complete set of RAPL domains.

The patch modifies the warning message to an informational message (pr_info) and only prints out the RAPL domains that are supported. This change provides more accurate and helpful information to users.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It directly addresses the issue at hand and improves the user experience.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to replace the use of VM_NO_THP and VM_BUG_ON with an actual VMA check in the mm/huge_memory.c file.

2. The patch addresses an issue where khugepaged (a kernel thread responsible for collapsing transparent huge pages) cannot distinguish private /dev/zero mappings from other special mappings like /dev/hpet, which has no vm_ops and populates PTEs in mmap.

3. The patch fixes false-positive VM_BUG_ON and prevents installing Transparent Huge Pages (THP) where they are not expected.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Reported-by, and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to transparent huge pages and improves the accuracy of VMA checks.

true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes a bug related to the detection of BREAK on the sunsab serial console. Previously, BREAK detection was only performed when there were also serial characters received simultaneously. However, to handle all BREAKs correctly, the patch duplicates the code fragment responsible for checking for BREAK and calling uart_handle_break(). This duplicated code is then pulled out of the loop over the received characters.

The patch is signed-off by two contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them. Additionally, the patch applies to the 3.16-rc6 version of the Linux kernel.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the correct detection of BREAK on the sunsab serial console, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to comply with the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses a potential issue in the suspend flow of the iwlwifi driver. If the suspend flow fails, the hardware is restarted to return to the D0 image. However, the patch ensures compliance with the fw_restart module parameter, allowing for debugging in case something goes wrong when starting the D3 image.

The patch modifies the __iwl_mvm_suspend function in the d3.c file of the iwlwifi driver. It adds a conditional check to decrement the mvm->restart_fw counter and only restart the hardware if the counter is greater than zero. This ensures compliance with the fw_restart flag and prevents unnecessary clearing of firmware state when an error occurs during the D3 image startup.

Therefore, based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc64 architecture. The warning indicates that the function `find_numa_latencies_for_group()` references the function `find_mlgroup()` without the appropriate `__init` annotation.

The patch addresses this issue by adding the `__init` annotation to both `find_numa_latencies_for_group()` and `find_best_numa_node_for_mlgroup()` functions. This ensures that these functions are only called during the initialization phase.

Given that the patch fixes a section mismatch warning and adds the necessary `__init` annotations, it can be considered a non-trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a potential crash in the __netdev_pick_tx() function in the bridge code. The bug is triggered when a packet is received on a NIC using skb_mark_napi_id(). The patch fixes the issue by clearing the sender_cpu field in the skb structure before forwarding it.

Considering that the bug can potentially cause a crash, and the patch addresses a specific issue related to skb handling in the bridge code, it seems like a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing a call to `cpsw_ale_stop` function in the `cpsw_ale_destroy` function in the `cpsw_ale.c` file.

Considering the information provided, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue that can cause a deadlock. Therefore, it can be considered a critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the VMMOUSE driver in the Linux kernel. It removes the unnecessary reservation of port 0x5658 by the VMMOUSE driver. The port is already reserved by the ACPI module during system startup, making it unavailable for other drivers to reserve.

The patch explains that this port is designed to be shared among multiple VMWare services, including VMMOUSE. Therefore, VMMOUSE should not attempt to reserve this port on its own.

The removal of the port reservation is done by removing the request_region() calls in the vmmouse_detect() and vmmouse_init() functions. The release_region() calls are also removed accordingly.

The patch includes a Signed-off-by line from the author and a Reviewed-by line from another developer. It also includes a Cc line for the stable kernel mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for stable releases.

Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a specific issue related to port reservation in the VMMOUSE driver and does not contain any trivial fixes. It appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues with port availability and driver conflicts.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that causes a hang in certain scenarios during session recovery in NFSv4.1. The patch ensures that session recovery is completed before retrying the lock, preventing the hang.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to connection monitoring during disassociation in the mac80211 subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds a call to `ieee80211_stop_poll(sdata)` in the `ieee80211_set_disassoc` function. This function is responsible for setting the disassociation state for a given sub-interface data structure (`sdata`).

2. The `ieee80211_stop_poll` function is called to stop the connection monitor poll during disassociation. This clears the polling flags and ensures that any deferred scan will be run.

3. The `ieee80211_sta_connection_lost` function, which is called when a station loses its connection, no longer calls `ieee80211_stop_poll(sdata)` as it is already called in `ieee80211_set_disassoc`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to connection monitoring during disassociation. It ensures that any deferred scan is run and prevents further scan requests from being blocked until the interface is brought down and up again. This can potentially resolve problems connecting to another access point.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can impact connectivity, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the Realtek ALC889 audio codec on VAIO Z machines. The patch addresses a regression that causes silent output from the speaker. 

The patch introduces a fix-up to choose the speaker pin as the primary output, ensuring that the correct DAC is assigned on this device. It also adds a new fixup function, `alc882_fixup_no_primary_hp`, which prevents the HP output from being taken as the primary output on VAIO Z machines.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a specific regression on a specific hardware configuration, it seems to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. The issue it fixes can be considered a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the audio output.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the tick broadcast mechanism in the Linux kernel. The patch checks if the system is in periodic mode and if the broadcast device is hrtimer-based. If both conditions are met, it returns -EBUSY to indicate that there is no proper handling for this scenario.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on the information provided, it is not clear if this patch addresses any of the mentioned critical issues. It seems to be more of a specific scenario handling improvement rather than fixing a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

The patch forces the function `kernel_init_freeable()` to be marked as `noinline` to reduce code bloat. Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix an issue with the determination of the last logical address (last_la) used for the initial attempt at claiming a logical address in the CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) subsystem.

2. Bug impact: The incorrect condition in the code could result in the wrong last_la being used, potentially leading to incorrect logical address assignment.

3. Patch analysis:
   - The patch fixes the issue by correctly converting last_la to a mask when ANDing with type2mask.
   - The condition `!(last_la & type2mask[type])` is replaced with `!((1 << last_la) & type2mask[type])`, which correctly checks if the last_la is not present in the type2mask[type] bitmask.
   - If the condition is true, the last_la is set to the first logical address in the la_list.

4. Patch impact:
   - The patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect logical address assignment in the CEC subsystem.
   - It does not introduce any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could result in incorrect logical address assignment in the CEC subsystem.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing a redundant error check on the return code of `copy_to_user`. The check is already made a few lines earlier, and this redundant check is considered logically dead code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a possible information leak and improves the handling of credentials when switching to a new memory map (mm). Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description explains that the previous behavior of delaying the switch to new credentials until after mapping the executable was odd. This suggests that the current behavior is incorrect or suboptimal.

2. The patch also mentions that turning off profiling events and tracing before mapping the new executable state is necessary to prevent a possible information leak. This indicates a potential security issue that needs to be addressed.

3. The patch includes acknowledgments from several individuals, including Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code changes in the patch involve calling the `install_exec_creds` function after the `setup_new_exec` function, ensuring that the new credentials are switched before mapping the new executable state.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to credentials and security. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix an unchecked dereference of the `arch_pwrdm` variable in the `arch/arm/mach-omap2/powerdomain.c` file. This issue was reported by Dan Carpenter and has been acknowledged by Nishanth Menon.

The patch checks if `arch_pwrdm` is not null and if `arch_pwrdm->pwrdm_wait_transition` is not null before calling `arch_pwrdm->pwrdm_wait_transition(pwrdm)`. This change ensures that the dereference is safe and avoids potential issues.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of strncpy to strscpy in the orangefs_inode_getattr function in the orangefs-utils.c file.

2. The patch addresses a potential issue where a rogue client-core could send a symlink target that is not NUL terminated, which could result in corrupt data.

3. The patch uses strscpy instead of strncpy to copy the link target, which has a size limit defined by ORANGEFS_NAME_MAX.

4. If the strscpy function returns -E2BIG, indicating that the link target exceeds the size limit, the patch sets the return value to -EIO and jumps to the "out" label.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue that could lead to data corruption and ensures that the link target is properly copied within the defined size limit.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled for the ext4 file system. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Since the patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue it addresses, we need to analyze the code changes to determine its impact. The patch adds a check to enable journal checksumming if metadata checksumming is enabled. This change ensures consistency between metadata and journal checksumming.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. It appears to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a panic due to an inability to handle a kernel paging request. The bug is caused by freeing a Tx frag that was never mapped before. The patch modifies the loop in the `qlcnic_release_tx_buffers` function to start from index 1 instead of 0, ensuring that only mapped Tx frags are freed.

Given that the bug causes a panic and the patch addresses the issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a build error in the ARM architecture for the imx6q_sabrelite board when using a modular phylib. The error is caused by the undeclared identifier 'ksz9021rn_phy_fixup' in the 'imx6q_sabrelite_init' function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression, addresses a real issue, and has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HIH6130/1 sensor and certain I2C bus drivers that do not allow zero-length data transfers required to start a measurement.

2. The patch introduces a workaround by writing a zero dummy byte, which is ignored by the sensor. This workaround has been verified to work with the OMAP I2C bus driver on a BeagleBone board.

3. The patch includes a simplified initialization of the `write_length` variable.

4. The patch modifies the `hih6130_update_measurements` function to handle the case where zero-length packets are not allowed by the I2C bus driver. It writes the dummy byte and uses the `write_length` variable to specify the length of the measurement request.

5. The patch also updates the `hih6130_probe` function to set the `write_length` variable to 1 if the I2C bus driver does not support the `I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_QUICK` functionality.

Based on the above analysis, the patch addresses a real issue with the HIH6130/1 sensor and provides a viable workaround. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the probe function in the Bluetooth driver. The current implementation returns the value returned by hci_register_dev(), which is the HCI index. However, this can cause issues on systems where the btwilink device has an ID larger than 0.

The proposed fix changes the return value of the probe function to 0 on success. This ensures consistent behavior across systems and avoids potential problems.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue that could lead to problems on certain systems, but it does not fall into the category of a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

5. The patch updates the "davinci_emac_of_match" array to include the new compatible string and associate it with the "dm816_emac_data" structure.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds necessary support for the emac controller on the dm816x platform. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and addresses a specific hardware compatibility issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "s390/kdump: Clear subchannel ID to signal non-CCW/SCSI IPL". 

The patch description explains that there are use cases where an intermediate boot kernel uses kexec to boot the final production kernel. In this scenario, the original boot information should be provided to the production kernel. Therefore, clearing the boot information during kexec should not be done.

Looking at the code changes, the lines that clear the subchannel ID and number are being removed. These lines were previously used to signal the new kernel that no CCW or SCSI IPL has been done during kexec and kdump.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is reverting a change that is necessary for specific use cases involving kexec and kdump. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the impact of this change on the stability and functionality of the system.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the original commit being reverted and the specific use cases where this change is causing issues. Without this additional information, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be addressing a specific erratum related to the P2020/P2010 processors. The erratum, known as eTSEC 20, causes excess delays when transmitting large frames with TOE (TCP/IP hardware accelerations) enabled. The patch enables a workaround for this issue.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the excess delays in transmitting large frames with TOE enabled can impact network performance and cause delays.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, the excess delays can affect the transmission of large frames, which can lead to performance issues and potential data corruption.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? Based on the provided information, it does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug that can impact network performance and potentially cause data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a race condition between URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer, potentially leading to an oops in certain scenarios.

The patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue() function to remove TDs (Transfer Descriptors) from the TD lists and canceled TD lists before giving back the URB. It also includes additional changes in various functions to ensure proper removal of TDs from the lists.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause an oops and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture in the KVM module. The patch addresses a potential problem with accessing guest code during MMIO load completion, which could lead to reading the branch instruction from host user memory instead. 

The patch calculates the resume PC in advance and saves it in the vcpu->arch.io_pc field. It then restores the saved resume PC on MMIO completion. This ensures that the correct branch instruction is read from the guest code.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix provided, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a potential data corruption issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a real issue related to interrupt timeout handling in the net/mvmdio driver. It ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, which guarantees that wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie. This fix prevents premature timeouts and improves the reliability of the driver.

The patch also includes a Tested-by tag from Nicolas Schichan, indicating that the fix has been tested successfully.

There are no trivial changes in this patch, such as spelling or whitespace fixes, which aligns with the requirement of not including trivial fixes in -stable releases.

Therefore, this patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for handling power-gating flags properly in the AMDGPU driver for VCE (Video Codec Engine). The patch checks if the power-gating support for VCE is enabled before attempting to start or stop the VCE block.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a security issue. However, it does seem to address an issue related to power-gating support for VCE. Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation of the patch by the appropriate Linux kernel maintainers or experts to determine its suitability for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "sunvnet: Initialize network_header and transport_header in vnet_rx_one()". It suggests initializing the network_header and transport_header fields in the skb structure created in the vnet_rx_one() function.

2. The patch adds the line "skb_reset_network_header(skb);" to reset the network_header field of the skb.

3. The patch checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag set. If it does, and the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, it proceeds to initialize the iphdr structure and compute the IP checksum.

4. The patch also checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag set and if the ip_summed field of the skb is CHECKSUM_NONE. If these conditions are met, it initializes the transport_header field of the skb and calls the vnet_fullcsum() function to compute the full checksum.

5. Finally, the patch checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM_OK flag set and sets the ip_summed and csum_level fields of the skb accordingly.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to checksum computation in the sunvnet driver. It ensures that the network_header and transport_header fields are properly initialized and that the checksums are computed correctly for IPv4 packets.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload). The patch introduces a new function `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` to detect TSO DMA buffers that cross into regions within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of any 4GB boundaries (4G, 8G, etc). If the device is of ASIC revision 5762 and the MSS is non-zero, the function checks if the buffer crosses the boundary and triggers the workaround path if it does.

Considering the patch addresses a specific data corruption issue on a specific device family and introduces a new function to handle the detection, it seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply moves the `omap_hsmmc_context_save(host)` function call to a different location within the `omap_hsmmc_probe` function.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch verifies that the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" have not changed between the two copy_from_user() calls. This verification is necessary to prevent a potential buffer overflow.

2. The patch also handles a scenario where "cros_ec_cmd_xfer()" can set "s_cmd->insize" to a lower value. It ensures that the new smaller value is used to avoid copying too much data to the user.

3. The patch includes proper attribution to the reporter, fix commit, and sign-offs from relevant individuals.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone thorough testing and scrutiny.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue where a driver was printing an incorrect message about not being able to assign VMDq due to a lack of MSI-X vectors. The issue was caused by a missing line that initializes a variable, which was a merge error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix related to a merge error and does not address any significant problem.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to an information leak in AUDIT_GET requests. The patch initializes the "mask" member of the "status_set" structure to zero, which prevents the leakage of 4 bytes of kernel stack.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information leakage. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in block/blk-ioc.c.

2. The reverse double lock dancing in ioc_release_fn() is replaced with a trylock on the queue_lock. If the trylock succeeds, ioc_exit_icq() is called, and the queue_lock is unlocked. If the trylock fails, the ioc lock is released, and the function waits for a short period before attempting to acquire the ioc lock again.

3. The patch removes the need for tracking the last_q variable and the associated code for switching to a new request_queue.

4. The patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary lock acquisitions and releases.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch simplifies the code and does not introduce any new issues. It does not fix a critical bug or address any real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug related to event processing delay and potential data halt and disconnection on the AP interface when it coexists with a STA. The patch requeues work after the scan is complete for all VIF types, ensuring that event processing is not delayed or ignored.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and connectivity issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug in the btrfs_page_exists_in_range function, where the incorrect type is used for page indices derived from file offsets. This can lead to unexpected failures in the final check, causing the function to return false even when there is at least one page in the range.

2. The function is used to prevent races in hole punching and lock_extent_direct operations, where it ensures that there are no pages in the truncated range or before locking and starting direct I/O.

3. The bug can occur when the file is large, the affected range crosses the 16TiB boundary, and the internal state of file pages and pending operations match. It also requires that no ordered data has been started in the range.

4. While the worst consequence of the bug seems to be stale data read, it is still a real issue that can impact the correctness and reliability of the system.

Considering these factors, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to unexpected failures and potential data integrity issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific use case in the btrfs filesystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix an issue in the KVM virtual interrupt controller (vgic) code for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Christoffer Dall and Marc Zyngier, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the kvm_vgic_map_is_active() function in the vgic.c file. It replaces the existing call to dist_active_irq() with a new function vgic_irq_is_active(), passing the virtual IRQ as an argument.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the KVM virtual interrupt controller code. It fixes an incorrect check for the active state of an interrupt and ensures that the specific IRQ in question is correctly checked on the distributor.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a memory leak issue in the HID multitouch driver. The function `mt_free_input_name()` was not being called during the `.remove()` operation, resulting in allocated memory not being freed. This can lead to memory leaks over time.

The patch fixes this issue by restoring the original name before freeing it, ensuring that the pointer being freed is not already accessed. This prevents potential memory corruption or access to freed memory.

The patch also includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, this patch fixes a real issue (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue where new chunks are not allocated when there are missing devices in a degraded Btrfs filesystem. This issue occurs when allocating new chunks with a higher RAID level, as there may not be enough writable devices available. The patch proposes to ignore the number of missing devices when allocating new chunks.

2. Impact:
   This patch addresses a specific issue related to chunk allocation in a degraded Btrfs filesystem. It does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical bug. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch modify the calculation of the number of devices used for chunk allocation. The lines that add the count of missing devices are removed, and the number of writable devices is used directly.

Based on the analysis, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not fix a critical bug and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address two issues:

1. Allowing the media manager to be initialized without a storage backend for device drivers like null_blk.
2. Fixing incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, specifically the get/set bad block interface.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze each change:

1. The first change allows the media manager to be initialized without a storage backend for device drivers like null_blk. This change does not fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, this change does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. (NAK)

2. The second change fixes incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, specifically the get/set bad block interface. This change does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to capability configuration in null_blk. However, without further context or information about the severity of this issue, it is difficult to determine if it qualifies as a critical bug fix. If this issue is causing data corruption or a security vulnerability, then it would meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Otherwise, if it is a non-critical issue, it may not be suitable for inclusion in a stable release. Without additional information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. (Undecided)

In summary, based on the provided information, the first change does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release (NAK), and the decision for the second change depends on the severity of the issue it addresses (Undecided).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to optimize the irq restore process for the s390 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h` file.
   - It adds a new macro `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` which represents the enabled state for external and I/O interrupts.
   - This change seems reasonable and does not appear to introduce any issues.

2. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h` file.
   - It modifies the `arch_local_irq_restore` function to check if the `flags` parameter indicates a transition from disabled to enabled interrupts.
   - If the transition is valid, it calls `arch_local_irq_enable` to enable interrupts.
   - This change seems reasonable and does not appear to introduce any issues.

3. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h` file.
   - It modifies the `arch_irqs_disabled_flags` function to check if the `flags` parameter indicates disabled interrupts.
   - This change seems reasonable and does not appear to introduce any issues.

4. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/mm/init.c` file.
   - It replaces the call to `arch_local_irq_restore` with a call to `__arch_local_irq_stosm` with the argument `0x04`.
   - This change seems reasonable and does not appear to introduce any issues.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is optimizing the irq restore process for the s390 architecture without introducing any issues. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the provided information.

The patch addresses an issue related to interrupt flags on the Rx LL2 in the qed driver. It explains that before iterating over the LL2 Rx ring, the ring's spinlock is taken via spin_lock_irqsave(). However, the actual processing of the packet, including handling by the protocol driver, is done without the lock. As a result, the patch fixes a problem where the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This could lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

Based on this information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause incorrect interrupt status. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering the patch's Fixes tag, which references a specific commit, and the presence of Signed-off-by tags from relevant contributors, it indicates that the patch has undergone review and testing.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a regression introduced by a previous commit that removed the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) in the IPX protocol implementation. The regression caused a deadlock scenario in which a blocking recvmsg syscall would prevent a concurrent sendmsg syscall on the same socket.

The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to release the socket lock before calling skb_recv_datagram, which resolves the deadlock issue. The socket lock is only held while working with the socket data.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone proper scrutiny.

Overall, this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a deadlock scenario, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a potential issue related to task migration and swap target selection in the NUMA scheduler. It avoids selecting oneself as a swap target, which can cause problems when trying to acquire the same lock twice for swap migration.

Although this patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it addresses a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or system instability. Therefore, I would consider this patch as a potential candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

However, to make a final decision, I would need to review the patch in more detail, including the code changes and any associated discussions or feedback from the community.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a bug related to the contamination of the percpu pointer with the DEAD flag. The patch proposes an update to the __ref_is_percpu() function to test both the ATOMIC and DEAD flags before returning the percpu pointer.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real issue where recent Linux clients send GETLAYOUT requests with minlength less than the blocksize. According to RFC 5661 section 18.43.3, servers are not allowed to impose such restrictions on layouts.

The patch removes the check that rejects I/O requests smaller than the filesystem block size or not aligned to it. This check is not compliant with the RFC and has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some clients.

Since the patch fixes a real issue that can cause hangs and aligns the behavior with the RFC, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug where partitions added by user space to the loop device were not being cleaned up after detaching the loop device.

2. The current implementation issues a BLKRRPART command to clean up partitions if LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN is set, which means that the partitions were auto-scanned on attach.

3. The patch replaces the BLKRRPART command with code that unconditionally cleans up partitions on detach.

4. Additionally, the patch exports the delete_partition() function, which was modified by Jens Axboe.

5. In the loop_clr_fd() function, the patch removes the BLKRRPART command and adds code to remove all partitions explicitly. This is necessary because BLKRRPART won't remove user-added partitions when max_part=0.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to cleaning up partitions when detaching the loop device. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses an issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to reading remote attributes in the XFS filesystem. The bug causes a verification error when CRCs are enabled, resulting in a failure to read maximally sized remote attributes.

The patch addresses two issues causing the bug. Firstly, it corrects the calculation of the mapped length, taking into account the CRC headers. Secondly, it adjusts the calculation of the byte count of valid data within a buffer to consider the possibility of longer buffers due to headers.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and that it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification related to adjusting thermal protection requirements in the DRM Radeon driver. The patch removes the dependency on clock gating for thermal protection on certain hardware models and instead relies solely on the presence of a thermal sensor.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to a NULL dereference, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses an issue that could cause data corruption or a crash, which falls under the criteria for acceptance.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a build error caused by misleading indentation in the code. The error is triggered by a warning from gcc-6, indicating that the code is indented as if it were guarded by an "if" clause, but it is not.

The patch adds missing braces to the code block that follows the "if (slave != mlx4_master_func_num(dev))" statement. This change ensures that the code is correctly indented and guarded by the "if" clause.

Since the patch addresses a build error and does not involve trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the IRQF_EARLY_RESUME flag is not required for nested IRQs anymore, as a previous commit already addressed the issue.
2. The patch also mentions that the previous fix missed a stray flag, which caused a crash on resume on the BeagleBoard-X15 platform.
3. The crash log indicates an "Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort" error, which suggests a critical issue.
4. The patch fixes the issue by removing the IRQF_EARLY_RESUME flag from the IRQ setup code.
5. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the original fix, confirming that this patch is addressing a real bug.
6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant maintainers and developers.

Considering the critical nature of the crash and the fact that the patch addresses a real bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the handling of snap_context in the rbd_queue_workfn() function. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The commit message explains that the patch fixes a problem introduced by commit 4e752f0ab0e8, which moved ceph_get_snap_context() out of rbd_img_request_create() and into rbd_queue_workfn(). This change caused an extra put on snapc, leading to a reference leak.

2. The patch correctly sets snapc to NULL after assigning it to img_request->rq, indicating that img_request consumes a reference to snapc. This prevents the extra put on snapc.

3. The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug that could potentially lead to a reference leak. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the ehci-hcd driver related to isochronous data handling. The bug can lead to memory leaks and failures to complete isochronous URBs.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for improving the output resolution of power readings in the fam15h_power driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description explains that on high CPU load, the accumulating values in the running_avg_cap register are very low, leading to poor output resolution. This indicates a real issue affecting the accuracy of power readings.

2. The patch modifies the calculation of curr_pwr_watts, which is the current power consumption in watts. It adjusts the calculation to keep all the bits and improve the output resolution.

3. The changes in the patch do not involve trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They directly address the issue by modifying the calculation logic.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that affects the accuracy of power readings. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses the issue directly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue related to demux ids in rdma_cm instead of ib_cm. It proposes using the P_Key value in the packet headers to determine the netdev.

2. The patch mentions that the mlx5 and ipath drivers currently cannot send correct P_Key values in GMP headers. Instead, they always send using a single P_Key set during the GSI QP initialization.

3. The proposed solution is to modify the rdma_cm code to look at the P_Key value that is part of the packet payload as a workaround until the drivers are fixed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to incorrect P_Key values in certain drivers. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code to handle the P_Key value differently. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a bug related to dereferencing an error pointer in the rapidio driver. It addresses the issue by modifying the code to properly unwind and handle the error condition.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced in commit 6df5a128f0fd. The regression caused a potential overflow in the send queue due to a wrongly set static variable, sig_count. The patch proposes to keep sig_count per connection instead of as a static variable.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to out-of-bounds memory accesses in the nouveau_fbcon_init() function. The bug report and the Fixes tag also indicate that this patch addresses a real issue.

However, upon analyzing the patch itself, it seems to be a trivial fix. The change made in the patch is to add a null check before accessing the fbdev structure. This change does not fix any critical bug, build error, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is more of a defensive programming measure to prevent potential issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the returned symbol rate calculation in the tda10071 driver for DVB frontends. The patch multiplies the symbol rate value by 1000, which seems to be a necessary correction.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug in the symbol rate calculation, which can impact the accuracy of data transmission and reception.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? No, the bug does not seem to cause any of these issues directly.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch disables the forced PORTS_IMPL for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3.
2. It explains that some early controllers incorrectly reported zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register, and the ahci driver fabricated PORTS_IMPL based on the number of ports in those cases.
3. With the new nvme controllers, there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should be honored.
4. The patch disables the workaround for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to incorrect reporting of zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register. It is not a trivial fix, as it involves disabling a workaround for certain AHCI versions. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific bug related to handling non-VGA class PCI devices with ATRM on newer PX systems. The bug report associated with the patch indicates that it is a real issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check for non-VGA class PCI devices in the `radeon_atrm_get_bios` function.
2. It attempts to fetch the ATRM handle for these non-VGA class devices using ACPI.
3. If the ATRM handle is found, the patch sets the `found` flag to true and breaks out of the loop.
4. If the `found` flag is still false after the loop, the function returns false.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real bug related to handling non-VGA class PCI devices with ATRM. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is aimed at disabling semaphores by default on Sandy Bridge (SNB) architecture due to reported GPU hangs when large amounts of text scroll in an xterm. The patch is specific to SNB and does not affect other architectures like Ivy Bridge (IVB).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue (GPU hangs) and can be classified as a critical bug. Therefore, it meets the requirement of fixing a real and critical bug. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Given these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that could potentially lead to a system crash. The patch addresses a double-free bug that occurs when a new beacon is generated and the previous ath_buf is reused. If getting a new beacon fails, the skb is freed but the bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, leading to a double-free on the next beacon transmission attempt.

Considering that this bug can cause a system crash, it qualifies as a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption in the spi-ti-qspi driver. The bug occurs when spi_finalize_current_message() is called before terminating the transfer at the hardware side, which can lead to overlapping transactions and data corruption.

The patch addresses this issue by moving the command to terminate the transfer to before calling spi_finalize_current_message().

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
