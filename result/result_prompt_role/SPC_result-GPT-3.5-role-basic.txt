The patch removes the "blocked" flag in the mlx4_en_tx_ring structure and replaces it with a call to netif_tx_queue_stopped to check the state of the queue. This change avoids a race condition where the completion function could check the "blocked" flag before it is set, leading to the TX queue not being opened.

The patch also removes the code that sets the "blocked" flag and wakes up the TX queue in the mlx4_en_process_tx_cq function. Instead, it checks if the TX queue is stopped and if at least one packet was completed, and then wakes up the TX queue.

In the mlx4_en_xmit function, the patch removes the code that sets the "blocked" flag and stops the TX queue. Instead, it directly stops the TX queue using netif_tx_stop_queue.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code and removes the redundant "blocked" flag, improving the reliability of the TX queue stop/wake flow.

Explanation: 

The patch removes the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the clk-44xx.c, clk-54xx.c, and clk-7xx.c files in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 clock driver. This is necessary because when the gpmc.c file calls clk_get(..., "fck"), it gets a dummy clock with a rate of zero, which can result in divisions by zero and misconfigured timings. By removing the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock, gpmc.c can fail gracefully instead of causing issues with devices on the bus.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Tero Kristo <t-kristo@ti.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a TI maintainer.

The patch is reverting a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to not work reliably. It may work for some people with certain combinations of USB host controllers, but for others, it puts the device to sleep and it will not wake up for any event. This can result in important events being missed, such as HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request.

The patch also mentions that there were previous patches to the xHCI USB controller that fixed this issue for some people but not for all, indicating that there may be a problem in the USB subsystem or the USB host controllers, or it could be a hardware issue.

Given the unreliability and potential for missed events, it is recommended to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This patch fixes two regressions in the nouveau driver caused by changes in the move_notify function. The first regression is due to the move_notify call being moved after the move operation, causing new_mem to sometimes point to a stale node. The second regression is caused by the call to move_notify from cleanup_memtype_use, which passes TTM ghost objects into the driver.

The patch reverts the change in move_notify and replaces it with a cleanup in the move failure path. It also adds a check in nouveau_bo_move_ntfy to ensure that only the driver's BO destructor is used.

The patch also adds a call to move_notify in ttm_bo_handle_move_mem if the driver has a move_notify function. If the move operation fails, the patch swaps the values of mem and bo->mem, calls move_notify, and then swaps them back.

The patch is reverting a previous commit that fixed a warning message in acpi_battery_get_state(). The reason for reverting is that capping 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity' is considered wrong. The patch argues that good battery firmwares allow 'capacity_now' to increase above 'full_charge_capacity' and update the latter when the battery is fully charged. By capping 'capacity_now', accurate capacity reporting is lost until charging is complete whenever 'full_charge_capacity' needs to be increased.

Based on this reasoning, it is recommended to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This patch fixes a double-free bug in the ath9k driver when generating a beacon. The bug occurs when the next beacon is sent and the ath_buf from the previous run is reused. If getting a new beacon from mac80211 fails, the bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, yet the skb is freed, leading to a double-free on the next beacon tx attempt and resulting in a system crash.

The patch correctly sets bf->bf_mpdu to NULL after freeing the skb, preventing the double-free bug from occurring.

The patch also includes the Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org tag, indicating that it should be considered for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on this analysis, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This patch fixes a data corruption issue in the spi-ti-qspi driver. The patch correctly moves the writing of an invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG before calling spi_finalize_current_message(). This ensures that the chip select is de-asserted before scheduling the next transfer, preventing data corruption. The patch also includes the necessary stable tag, indicating that it should be applied to -stable releases.
