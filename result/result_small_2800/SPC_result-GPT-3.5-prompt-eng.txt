1. The patch aims to use PCI Express Capability access functions to simplify the ath9k driver.

2. The patch removes the usage of the `pci_pcie_cap` function and replaces it with the `pcie_capability_clear_word` and `pcie_capability_read_word` functions.

3. The patch also removes the usage of `pci_read_config_byte` and `pci_write_config_byte` functions and replaces them with `pcie_capability_clear_word` and `pcie_capability_read_word` functions.

4. The patch checks if the device is a PCI Express device using the `is_pciexpress` flag. If it is not, the function returns without making any changes.

5. If Bluetooth coexistence is enabled, the patch clears the ASPM (Active State Power Management) settings for both the current device and its parent device using the `pcie_capability_clear_word` function.

6. If Bluetooth coexistence is not enabled, the patch reads the ASPM settings from the parent device using the `pcie_capability_read_word` function.

7. If the ASPM settings indicate that L0s or L1 power states are enabled, the `aspm_enabled` flag is set to true.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch simplifies the code by using PCI Express Capability access functions and ensures consistent ASPM settings for the ath9k driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the nature of the patch and its potential benefits, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the function `vlv_infoframe_enabled` in the `intel_hdmi.c` file of the `i915` driver. The purpose of this function is to check if the infoframe is enabled for a given encoder.

The patch introduces a new variable `intel_dig_port` of type `struct intel_digital_port` and initializes it with the value of `enc_to_dig_port(encoder)`. This variable represents the digital port associated with the encoder.

Next, the patch adds a new variable `port` and assigns it the value of `intel_dig_port->port`. This variable represents the port associated with the digital port.

The patch then modifies the return statement of the function. It checks if the `port` matches the port value obtained from the register `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK` and if so, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `val` and `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary check to ensure that the infoframe is enabled only for the correct port. This check improves the accuracy and reliability of the function.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

This change is made to ensure uniformity and compatibility with device tree (DT) usage.

The patch modifies the `__ae_match` function to compare the `fwnode_handle` instead of the `device_node`. Similarly, the `find_ae` function is updated to accept a `fwnode_handle` parameter instead of `device_node`. The `hnae_get_handle` function is also modified to use `fwnode_handle` instead of `device_node`.

In addition, the `hns_nic_priv` structure is updated to include a `fwnode_handle` pointer instead of a `device_node` pointer.

Overall, this patch seems to be a necessary change to ensure compatibility and uniformity in the `hnae` driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing an unnecessary check in the ip6t_SYNPROXY module of the netfilter subsystem. The patch suggests that ip6_route_output() will never return a NULL pointer, so the check for NULL can be removed.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change removes unnecessary code and does not introduce any new risks or issues.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch replaces the calculation of `ced->shift` and `ced->mult` with a call to `clockevents_config(ced, p->rate)`. This change simplifies the code and uses the `clockevents_config()` helper function.

2. The patch removes the calculation of `ced->max_delta_ns` and `ced->min_delta_ns` and replaces it with a call to `clockevent_delta2ns(0xffffffff, ced)`. This change also simplifies the code.

3. The patch replaces the call to `clockevents_register_device(ced)` with `clockevents_config_and_register(ced, 1, 0x300, 0xffffffff)`. This change not only registers the clock event device but also configures it with specific parameters.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch improves the code by using the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. It simplifies the code and addresses a long-standing TODO item.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is modifying the drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16209_trigger.c and drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16240_trigger.c files. The patch replaces the existing event handler functions adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll() and adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll() with the iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function.

1. The patch adds a new function called `calibration_delay_done()`. This function is intended to be used by architectures to stop accepting registrations for new timer-based delay functions.

2. The function is marked as weak, which means it can be overridden by architecture-specific implementations if needed.

3. The patch also includes a dummy implementation of the `calibration_delay_done()` function, which does nothing. This allows architectures to use this function without requiring an immediate implementation.

4. The `calibration_delay_done()` function is called at the end of the `calibrate_delay()` function, indicating that the calibration process is complete.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and an Acked-by from Russell King, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant parties.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable addition to the Linux kernel. It provides a mechanism for architectures to signal the completion of delay calibration and stop accepting new timer registrations. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is recommended because the driver-core now supports synchronous self-deletion of attributes, and the asynchronous removal mechanism is scheduled for removal. Using `device_remove_file_self()` makes the "delete" behavior synchronous, which is desired.

2. The patch removes the `sdev_store_delete_callback()` function, which was previously used as a callback for `device_schedule_callback()`. This function is no longer needed with the new approach.

3. The `sdev_store_delete()` function is modified to use `device_remove_file_self()` instead of `device_schedule_callback()`. If `device_remove_file_self()` is successful, it proceeds to call `scsi_remove_device()` to remove the SCSI device.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary callback functions and replaces the asynchronous removal mechanism with a synchronous one. This change aligns with the direction of the driver-core and improves the behavior of the "delete" operation.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch has been reviewed by Pavel Shilovsky and signed-off by Jeff Layton, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

4. The changes made by the patch are related to displaying mount options and do not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable and non-disruptive change that improves the display of mount options. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a message print when firmware fails to be requested in the case of platform data being used. This is a useful addition as it provides better error handling and debugging information.

2. The patch distinguishes between the error messages of the device tree and platform data cases. This differentiation helps in identifying the source of the error more accurately, which can be helpful during troubleshooting.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the `sdma_probe` function in the `imx-sdma.c` file, ensuring that the impact is limited to the specific functionality being addressed.

Overall, the patch improves error reporting and enhances the clarity of error messages. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current code allows a recovery to be queued during boot, which can lead to a kernel panic when trying to stop an already stopped hardware.

2. The fix ensures that a recovery is only queued if the wl->state is on (WLCORE_STATE_ON). This verification prevents the recovery from being queued during boot when the hardware is already stopped.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

4. The code changes are minimal and focused, making it less likely to introduce new issues.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific problem and has been reviewed by the authors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure in the `dce_v10_0.c` file of the AMDGPU driver.

2. The `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` function checks if the display is hung using the `dce_v10_0_is_display_hung` function. If the display is hung, it sets the `hang` flag of the `AMD_IP_BLOCK_TYPE_DCE` IP block status to true; otherwise, it sets it to false.

3. The `dce_v10_0_soft_reset` function is modified to check if the `hang` flag of the `AMD_IP_BLOCK_TYPE_DCE` IP block status is false. If it is false, the function returns 0 without performing a soft reset. This change ensures that a soft reset is only performed when the display is hung.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a new function that improves the handling of soft resets in the AMDGPU driver by checking if the display is hung before performing the reset. This can help prevent unnecessary soft resets and improve system stability.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a constification patch, which aims to make the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers const. This patch is intended to improve code quality and prevent accidental modification of these variables.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug, it can be considered a code improvement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the wacom_raw_event function in the hid-wacom.c file. The purpose of the patch is to move the check for the Graphire report header to a more appropriate location. The current check is only valid for Wacom Graphire devices, as their reports always start with 0x03. However, the Intuos4 WL high-speed reports begin with 0x04, so the check would incorrectly filter out valid reports.

The patch adds an additional check specifically for the USB_DEVICE_ID_WACOM_GRAPHIRE_BLUETOOTH product. If the data[0] value is 0x03, it calls the wacom_gr_parse_report function to parse the report. Otherwise, it logs an error message and returns 0.

This change ensures that the check for the Graphire report header is only applied to the appropriate device, preventing valid reports from being filtered out for other devices.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Ping Cheng <pingc@wacom.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a relevant maintainer.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided Acked-by tag, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "staging: lustre: fix socklnd issues found by Klocwork Insight tool." This suggests that the patch aims to fix issues identified by the Klocwork Insight tool in the staging/lustre/lnet/klnds/socklnd/socklnd.c file.

2. The patch includes a fix for a null pointer issue. It mentions that a null pointer 'best_iface' that comes from line 802 may be dereferenced at line 832.

3. The patch adds a check for the null pointer 'best_iface' at line 804 using the LASSERT macro. This check ensures that 'best_iface' is not null before it is used.

4. The patch also adds another check for 'best_iface' at line 840 using the LASSERT macro.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to a null pointer dereference in the socklnd.c file. The added checks using the LASSERT macro help ensure that 'best_iface' is not null before it is used. This fix seems reasonable and necessary to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called `tpic2810_set` which is used to set the output level of the GPIO pin.
2. The `tpic2810_direction_output` function is modified to call `tpic2810_set` with the provided `value` parameter. This ensures that the proper output level is set for the GPIO pin.
3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior of the driver. It only improves the implementation by setting the output level correctly.
4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the `gpio-tpic2810` driver and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies three files: `ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`. In each file, there are two occurrences of the same pattern:

```
nla_put_failure:
    ...
    if (unlikely(...)) {
        ...
        return -EMSGSIZE;
    }
    ipset_nest_end(skb, ...);
    return 0;
}
```

The patch removes the unnecessary call to `ipset_nest_end()` before the `return 0` statement in each occurrence. This change avoids calling `ipset_nest_end()` needlessly in the error path, improving code efficiency.

The patch also includes the `Suggested-by` and `Signed-off-by` tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that eliminates unnecessary function calls in the error path. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro in three different places in the code. This change prevents the kernel from crashing unnecessarily when certain unexpected events or implementation errors occur.

2. The WARN() macro generates a warning message but allows the code execution to continue. This is a safer approach compared to the BUG() macro, which triggers a kernel panic and halts the system.

3. The warning messages provide useful information about the unexpected conditions encountered, such as an unexpected attribute index or an unexpected event. This information can be helpful for debugging and identifying potential issues in the code.

4. The patch also includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch improves the stability of the acpi_power_meter driver by handling unexpected conditions gracefully instead of crashing the kernel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to make virtual_lun0 a nullio device. This change suggests that virtual_lun0 should not be used for reading or writing data.

2. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Andy Grover and Nicholas Bellinger, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The patch modifies the core_dev_setup_virtual_lun0() function in the target_core_device.c file.

4. The line `char buf[] = "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1";` initializes the buf array with the value "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1". This change sets the configuration parameters for the virtual_lun0 device.

5. The line `hba->transport->set_configfs_dev_params(dev, buf, sizeof(buf));` sets the configuration parameters for the device using the buf array.

6. The patch does not introduce any potential issues or bugs. It simply modifies the configuration of the virtual_lun0 device.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and safe modification that improves the behavior of the virtual_lun0 device. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix to remove a redundant assignment in the da9052_gpio_probe function. The redundant assignment is removing the previous assignment of gpio->da9052 and then setting it again to the same value. 

Since this patch is a simple code cleanup and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered a low-risk change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix to address warnings related to symbol declarations in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The patch staticizes the symbols 'ab8500_alternate_functions' and 'ab8500_gpio_irq_cluster' to silence the warnings.

Considering that the symbols are only used within the pinctrl-ab8500.c file and there are no indications of any potential negative impact, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for setting a plane's rotation property from userspace in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the Mali-DP driver. 

The patch adds a set_property hook to the plane's functions, specifically the drm_atomic_helper_plane_set_property() function. This hook allows the rotation property to be set using the DRM_IOCTL_MODE_OBJ_SETPROPERTY ioctl.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it adds functionality without modifying existing code, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes two return values in the greybus audio_apbridgea driver.
2. The patch replaces the use of -ENOSYS with -EOPNOTSUPP for two stub operations.
3. The use of -ENOSYS is reserved for missing syscalls, so replacing it with -EOPNOTSUPP is more appropriate.
4. The patch has been signed-off by Johan Hovold and reviewed by Viresh Kumar.
5. The patch has also been signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is a well-known Linux kernel developer.

3. Testing: The patch should ideally have been tested on the affected chipsets to verify its functionality and compatibility. If there is evidence of thorough testing, it increases the confidence in the patch's stability.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to assess the relevance, code quality, and testing of the patch. Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). Further analysis and review by the appropriate maintainers and experts in the Linux kernel community would be necessary to make an informed decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite." It suggests updating file times only if page_mkwrite is not set and calls file_update_time manually.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed off by multiple contributors, including Yang Sheng, James Simmons, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the file "drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/llite/llite_mmap.c" by adding a call to file_update_time before the ll_page_mkwrite0 function.

4. Analysis: The patch aims to invoke file_update_time in the ll_page_mkwrite function of the Lustre filesystem staging driver. This change ensures that file times are updated correctly when page_mkwrite is not set. The patch appears to be a bug fix or improvement for the Lustre filesystem.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any regressions or conflicts with other parts of the kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes are related to making the `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs` arrays constant. The patch also updates the declaration of the arrays, as well as the `find_freq_tables()` and its callsites.

Considering that the arrays are only read and not modified, making them constant is a reasonable change. This can help improve code clarity and potentially optimize the compiler's handling of these arrays.

Additionally, the patch modifies the function signatures of `pxa_cpufreq_change_voltage()` and `find_freq_tables()` to use `const` pointers for the `pxa_freqs` parameter. This change ensures that the functions do not modify the `pxa_freqs` data, which is a good practice for improving code safety and maintainability.

Overall, the changes in this patch seem reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros from the code. These macros are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

2. The patch expands the macros in place, replacing them with the actual values they represent.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author, Ian Abbott, and reviewed by H Hartley Sweeten.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman, who is a well-known maintainer of the Linux kernel.

6. The patch also includes changes in the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/s626.h` file, which is a header file related to the code being modified.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch is a straightforward improvement that removes unnecessary macros and expands them in place. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the enqueue_task function calls in multiple places. The patch is signed-off by several reputable contributors.

ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK is being added to the enqueue_task calls when the task is already queued. This flag is used to indicate that the task should be enqueued without updating the runqueue clock. The rationale behind this change is that the DEQUEUE_SAVE operation already updates the runqueue clock, so there is no need to update it again during the enqueue operation.

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It seems to be a reasonable and well-justified change that improves the efficiency of the enqueue operation.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver. This is done to accommodate different clock names on multiple platforms, allowing the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name.

2. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi and Roger Quadros.

3. The changes made in the patch involve modifying clock names used in the driver's code. The original clock names "usb_phy_cm_clk32k" and "usb_otg_ss_refclk960m" are replaced with the generic names "wkupclk" and "refclk" respectively.

4. The patch also includes error handling and warning messages in case the generic clock names cannot be found. It falls back to the old clock names and provides information to fix the device tree source (DTS) accordingly.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or major changes. It only improves the code by using generic clock names and provides better compatibility across platforms.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe modification that improves the driver's flexibility and maintainability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new callback function called `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio_chip` structure in the `gpio-pca953x.c` driver. This callback is used to retrieve the direction of a GPIO pin.

2. The implementation of `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` reads the register value corresponding to the GPIO pin's direction using the `pca953x_read_single()` function. It then checks the bit corresponding to the GPIO pin in the register value and returns the direction (input or output) accordingly.

3. The patch also updates the `gpio_chip` structure initialization in the `pca953x_setup_gpio()` function to assign the new `gc->get_direction` callback to `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()`.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by two maintainers, Andy Shevchenko and Linus Walleij, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid addition to the `gpio-pca953x.c` driver, providing the long-awaited `->get_direction()` callback. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses build errors on device drivers with tristate Kconfig options when using custom initcall levels. This indicates that the patch is fixing a specific issue and improving the stability of the kernel.

2. The patch adds missing initcall_sync variants, which suggests that it enhances the synchronization of initialization calls. This can help ensure proper initialization order and prevent potential race conditions.

3. The patch updates the comment in init.h to describe valid use cases for custom initcall levels. This improves the documentation and provides clarity on when custom initcall levels are appropriate.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Tony Lindgren, Arnd Bergmann, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. This indicates that it has undergone review and approval from experienced kernel developers.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue, improves synchronization, and provides better documentation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements, which are used to emit a warning message if the specified condition is true. WARN_ON statements are commonly used in the Linux kernel to catch potential issues or unexpected behavior.

2. The first WARN_ON statement checks if the current device is not a Haswell CPU. If this condition is true, it means that the LynxPoint PCH (Platform Controller Hub) is not paired with a compatible CPU. Emitting a warning in this case is appropriate as it helps identify potential hardware compatibility issues.

3. The second WARN_ON statement checks if the current device is not an Ultrabook Low Power (ULT) CPU. If this condition is true, it means that the LynxPoint LP PCH is not paired with a compatible ULT CPU. Emitting a warning in this case is also appropriate as it helps identify potential hardware compatibility issues.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only adds warning messages to improve the detection of incompatible hardware configurations.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement for detecting incompatible hardware configurations and does not introduce any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the conditional logic in the visornic_init() function in the visornic_main.c file. The original code checks if the visorbus_register_visor_driver() function returns a success code, and if so, it returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to the cleanup_debugfs label.

The patch changes the logic to check if the visorbus_register_visor_driver() function returns an error code. If it does, it jumps to the cleanup_debugfs label. Otherwise, it continues execution and returns 0.

This change ensures that if the visorbus_register_visor_driver() function fails, the cleanup_debugfs label is reached, and the necessary cleanup operations are performed before returning 0.

Overall, this patch improves the error handling in the visornic_init() function, making it more robust. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests replacing the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err` in the `cpsw_probe_dt` function of the `cpsw.c` file. The reason for this change is not explicitly mentioned in the patch, but it is likely to align with the kernel's coding style and conventions.

The use of `dev_err` is preferred over `pr_err` when printing error messages related to a specific device. `dev_err` includes the device pointer as an argument, which helps in identifying the specific device that encountered the error. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

By using `dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Missing mdio platform device\n")`, the error message will now include the device pointer `&pdev->dev`, providing more context about the error.

Since this change improves the error reporting by including the device pointer, it is considered a good practice and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a checkpatch issue related to alignment matching open parenthesis. This indicates that the patch improves code readability and adheres to coding style guidelines.

2. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ian Abbott and Greg Kroah-Hartman, which suggests that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The changes in the patch are limited to the `ni_labpc.c` file in the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers` directory, which indicates that it is specific to the staging driver for National Instruments Lab-PC devices.

4. The patch modifies two functions: `labpc_ai_scan_period` and `labpc_eeprom_write`. In both cases, the alignment of the function parameters is adjusted to match the open parenthesis, improving code consistency.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward fix for a checkpatch issue and does not introduce any significant changes or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve code consistency by suggesting breaking lines before operators instead of after them. This change is applied to two sections of the code.

In the first section, the patch modifies the line where the `chanspec` variable is assigned. The original code breaks the line after the ternary operator, while the patch suggests breaking it before the operator. Both versions are functionally equivalent, but breaking the line before the operator is more consistent with the coding style used in the rest of the file.

In the second section, the patch modifies the line where the `s->range_table` variable is assigned. The original code breaks the line after the ternary operator, while the patch suggests breaking it before the operator. Again, both versions are functionally equivalent, but breaking the line before the operator is more consistent with the coding style used in the rest of the file.

Overall, the patch improves code consistency without introducing any functional changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `s_vGetFreeContext` to `vnt_get_free_context`. This is a straightforward renaming that improves code readability and consistency.

2. The function `vnt_get_free_context` is already defined in the patch, and it has the same implementation as the original `s_vGetFreeContext` function. This ensures that the functionality remains unchanged.

3. The patch updates all the references to the old function name `s_vGetFreeContext` to the new function name `vnt_get_free_context`. This ensures that the codebase is consistent and avoids any potential confusion.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing functionality. It only focuses on renaming the function.

Overall, the patch is a simple and straightforward change that improves code readability and consistency without introducing any risks or issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a crash and an error path cleanup in the staging driver slicoss. The patch checks if the kzalloc function fails to allocate memory and returns -ENOMEM in that case.

Considering that this patch addresses a crash and improves error handling, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a channel mismatch issue in the ak4642 codec driver. The original configuration had a minimum of 1 channel for both playback and capture, but the patch changes it to a minimum of 2 channels for both.

Considering that the ak4642 codec does not support mono recording and the ak4643 codec does, this patch aligns the configuration with the capabilities of the ak4642 codec. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

My decision is (A) ACK - the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the driver to use the new ethtool API functions, specifically the {get|set}_link_ksettings functions. This is because the previous API functions {get|set}_settings are deprecated. This is a good practice to ensure the driver is using the latest and recommended API.

2. The patch modifies the virtnet_validate_ethtool_cmd function to use the new ethtool_link_ksettings structure instead of the deprecated ethtool_cmd structure. This ensures compatibility with the new API.

3. The virtnet_set_link_ksettings function is updated to use the base.speed and base.duplex fields from the ethtool_link_ksettings structure instead of the deprecated fields from the ethtool_cmd structure. This ensures that the driver correctly sets the speed and duplex values.

4. The virtnet_get_link_ksettings function is updated to use the base.speed and base.duplex fields from the ethtool_link_ksettings structure instead of the deprecated fields from the ethtool_cmd structure. This ensures that the driver correctly retrieves the speed and duplex values.

5. The ethtool_ops structure is updated to use the new get_link_ksettings and set_link_ksettings functions instead of the deprecated get_settings and set_settings functions. This ensures that the driver correctly handles the ethtool operations.

Overall, the patch updates the driver to use the new ethtool API functions and ensures compatibility with the latest standards. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch replaces the use of smp_mb() with smp_store_mb/release() in the functions walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() and walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() in the arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c file.

The purpose of the patch is to ensure that a following spte read is not reordered ahead of the write to vcpu->mode in walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin(). This is achieved by using smp_store_mb() instead of smp_mb(). Similarly, in walk_shadow_page_lockless_end(), smp_store_release() is used to ensure that the write to vcpu->mode is not reordered ahead of any subsequent reads to sptes.

By using smp_store_mb/release() instead of smp_mb(), the patch provides stronger memory ordering guarantees, which can help prevent potential race conditions and ensure correct behavior.

Therefore, considering the improvement in memory ordering and the absence of any apparent issues or regressions, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds documentation for the '--call-graph' command line option in the perf report tool. This is a valuable addition as it clarifies the usage of the option.

2. The patch mentions an undocumented optional print_limit argument for the '--call-graph' option. By documenting this argument, it improves the usability of the tool.

3. The patch suggests using strtoul() to parse the print_limit argument since its type is u32. This ensures proper parsing and type conversion, enhancing the reliability of the code.

4. The patch includes appropriate Cc's to relevant individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed by them.

5. The patch provides a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list, allowing for further reference and review.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality from the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. The comment in the patch explains that the SYSRESET bits in the HDMI PLL do not actually reset the PLL itself but only affect the power used for the PLL. Since there is no reason to use the SYSRESET bits and they are not used in other PLLs, the patch suggests removing the HDMI PLL reset to simplify the code and make it similar to other PLLs.

The patch removes the `hdmi_pll_reset` function, which was responsible for controlling the SYSRESET bits and waiting for the reset to complete. The function is no longer called in the `hdmi_pll_enable` function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the HDMI PLL reset functionality is unnecessary and removing it simplifies the code. As long as the patch has been tested and does not introduce any regressions or issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a filesystem operation.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. The `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function is a variant of `lookup_one_len()` that performs the lookup without acquiring the parent directory's inode lock. This change is made to improve performance and reduce contention on the inode lock.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp`) than the original dentry (`dentry`). In this case, the comment explains that someone has renamed the dentry since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. The comment suggests that since the dentry has been looked up and connected, it will remain connected even after being renamed. Therefore, the function can simply release the `tmp` dentry and proceed to the `out_reconnected` label, indicating that the reconnection is successful.

Overall, the patch appears to be a performance improvement with a well-explained handling of a specific case. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

3. The patch also removes redundant code for finding the power management capability of the PCI device, as the pci core has already saved this value.
4. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors.
5. The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or behavior, but rather remove redundant code.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity and removes unnecessary operations, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command. This option allows explicit enabling of CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. This addition enhances the functionality of the "perf record" tool.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "builtin-record.c" file to handle the new option. It adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the list of available options and sets the "record.opts.sample_cpu" flag accordingly.

3. The "perf.h" file is modified to include the "sample_cpu" flag in the "record_opts" structure.

4. The "evsel.c" file is updated to check if the "sample_cpu" flag is set or if the target has a CPU, and if so, it sets the CPU sample bit for the event selector.

Overall, this patch introduces a new option to explicitly enable CPU sample type in the "perf record" command, which can be useful for tools like c2c record. It also includes the necessary changes in the code to handle this new option correctly. Therefore, it seems appropriate to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the `dm_thin_find_block()` function in the `dm-thin-metadata.c` file. The issue is that the `->fail_io` flag is checked outside the `metadata` device's `root_lock`, which can lead to a race condition with the setting of this flag.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for `pmd->fail_io` inside the `root_lock` section. If `pmd->fail_io` is true, the function returns `-EINVAL` and releases the `root_lock` before doing so.

This patch ensures that the `->fail_io` flag is properly synchronized with the `root_lock`, preventing any race conditions. Therefore, it improves the stability and reliability of the code.

Hence, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning related to NOHZ local_softirq_pending. This indicates that the patch addresses a known issue and aims to resolve it.

2. The patch replaces the usage of netif_rx() with netif_rx_ni(). The netif_rx_ni() function is specifically designed to be used from process/softirq context, which is the appropriate context for the given code. This change ensures that the correct function is used, improving code correctness.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the dp83640.c file, specifically in the rx_timestamp_work() function. This suggests that the patch is focused on fixing a specific issue in a specific area, minimizing the risk of unintended side effects.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple addition of MODULE_ALIAS for the aat2870-regulator platform. The MODULE_ALIAS macro is used to provide an alias for a module, allowing it to be loaded using an alias name instead of the full module name.

In this case, the patch adds the MODULE_ALIAS("platform:aat2870-regulator") line, which means that the module can be loaded using the alias "platform:aat2870-regulator". This can be useful in scenarios where the module needs to be loaded automatically based on the alias name.

Considering the nature of this patch, it does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing code. It is a small addition that improves the module's usability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds debug error messages to report command timeout in the `lio_process_ordered_list()` function. This can be helpful for debugging and identifying any issues related to command timeouts.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the `if_cfg_callback()` function. This provides additional information about the failure status, which can aid in troubleshooting and understanding the cause of the failure.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes are specific to the `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c` and `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/response_manager.c` files, which suggests that they are targeted and relevant to the specific functionality of the Cavium LiquidIO network driver.

Overall, the patch seems to improve error reporting and debugging capabilities in the Cavium LiquidIO network driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the usage of the of_match_ptr() function in the tegra-usb phy driver.
2. The comment in the patch states that the data structure protected by of_match_ptr() is always compiled in, indicating that the protection is unnecessary.
3. The of_match_table field in the platform_driver structure is modified to directly assign tegra_usb_phy_id_table instead of using of_match_ptr().
4. The patch is signed-off by Sachin Kamat and Felipe Balbi, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
5. The patch also includes Cc to Stephen Warren and the relevant mailing list, indicating that it has been shared with the appropriate stakeholders for review.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch removes redundant code and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to tidy up the ni_stc.h file in the staging/comedi directory.

false || Based on the provided patch, it is clear that the patch aims to constify the `of_device_id` arrays in three different drivers (`mxc_w1.c`, `omap_hdq.c`, and `w1-gpio.c`). The purpose of this change is to ensure that the `of_device_id` arrays are always used as const, which is a good practice.

Considering that `of_device_id` arrays are used as const in other parts of the kernel (e.g., `driver.of_match_table` and open firmware functions), it is reasonable to apply this change consistently across all drivers.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `whitelist` array in the `intel_uncore.c` file of the i915 driver. Specifically, it changes the `gen_bitmask` value for the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` entry from `GEN_RANGE(4, 8)` to `GEN_RANGE(4, 9)`. This change allows the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP for the supported gens.

2. The patch has been reviewed by Rodrigo Vivi and signed-off by Damien Lespiau and Daniel Vetter, who are all Intel employees. Their expertise in the i915 driver suggests that the patch has been thoroughly reviewed and tested.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It appears to be a targeted fix that allows the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP for the supported gens, which can improve the functionality and stability of the i915 driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function in the `drm/nouveau/abi16` module. This locked variant is necessary for providing limited interoperability in USIF.

2. The existing `nouveau_abi16_get()` function is made static and renamed to `nouveau_abi16()`.

3. The new `nouveau_abi16_get()` function takes a `drm_file` structure as an argument and acquires the client mutex lock before accessing the ABI16 data.

4. If the `nouveau_abi16()` function returns a non-NULL value, the `cli->abi16` pointer is returned. Otherwise, the client mutex is released, and NULL is returned.

5. The `nouveau_abi16_put()` function is not modified in this patch.

Overall, this patch introduces a necessary locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function, ensuring proper synchronization when accessing ABI16 data. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the behavior to prevent overwriting csma settings when setting the channel afterwards. This indicates that there was a bug or unintended behavior in the previous code, and the patch aims to correct it.

2. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Stefan Schmidt, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review and has been approved by another developer.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, Alexander Aring and Marcel Holtmann, indicating that they take responsibility for the code changes.

4. The code changes in the patch are straightforward and focused. The existing code sets the channel by writing to a register, but the patch replaces it with a more appropriate function call, atusb_write_subreg(), which handles the channel setting correctly.

5. The patch also includes a comment indicating that the CCA mode should be made configurable, which suggests that the authors are aware of potential improvements for future development.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a missing helper function called `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to the `crypto` subsystem. This function returns the block size of an ahash (asymmetric hash) algorithm.

2. The function is properly documented with a description of its purpose and return value.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to the `include/crypto/hash.h` header file.

4. The patch is signed-off by Herbert Xu, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

Overall, this patch seems to be a straightforward addition of a missing helper function, which enhances the functionality of the `crypto` subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve performance by using the __fls() function instead of fls() when the argument is known to be non-null. This change is expected to be faster since __fls() does not perform an additional increment like fls() does.

2. The patch includes a comment explaining that fls(x) is equal to __fls(x) + 1, which clarifies the relationship between the two functions.

3. The patch modifies the calculation of the variable "mp" by replacing fls(pref_mismatch) with __fls(pref_mismatch) and subtracting 1. This change ensures that the correct value is assigned to "mp" based on the updated understanding of the fls() and __fls() functions.

4. The patch does not introduce any new dependencies or potential issues.

Considering the performance improvement and the correctness of the changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the issue it addresses. The patch adds the missing `mutex_destroy()` calls when the driver is removed, ensuring proper cleanup of resources. 

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. When the interface is down, a mailbox command to get context statistics fails. This patch restricts the driver from issuing the get statistics command when the interface is down.

2. The patch includes a clear explanation of the problem and the solution implemented.

3. The patch is signed-off by the original author, Shahed Shaikh, and also by David S. Miller, who is a well-known maintainer of the Linux kernel networking subsystem.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the qlcnic_main.c file, specifically in the __qlcnic_down() function.

5. The added line `adapter->ahw->linkup = 0;` sets the linkup flag to 0 when the interface is down, indicating that the link status is cleared.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the check for backlog size from l2cap_core.c to l2cap_sock.c. This change suggests that the check for backlog size is more appropriate in l2cap_sock.c, which handles socket-specific code.

2. The patch removes the socket-specific code from l2cap_core.c. This change indicates that the socket-specific code is no longer needed in l2cap_core.c and should be handled in l2cap_sock.c instead.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the respective contributors.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch improves the organization and separation of concerns within the codebase. It moves the backlog size check to the appropriate file and removes unnecessary socket-specific code from l2cap_core.c. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward optimization. The patch removes an unnecessary memset operation on memory allocated with vzalloc. Since vzalloc already initializes the allocated memory to zero, the memset operation is redundant and can be safely removed.

Given that this patch is a simple optimization and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a signature mismatch in the function `regulator_get_error_flags()` when `CONFIG_REGULATOR` is not defined. This ensures that both declarations match, preventing compiler errors.

2. The patch adds an additional parameter `unsigned int *flags` to the function `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change allows the caller to retrieve the error flags associated with the regulator.

3. The function implementation itself returns `-EINVAL`, indicating that the error flags are not available. This behavior is consistent with the previous implementation.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the signature mismatch and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch defers building the osd request until just before submitting it in all callers except ceph_writepages_start(). This change can help improve performance and reduce unnecessary overhead.

2. In the start_read() function, the patch moves the ceph_osdc_build_request() call after allocating the page vector. This ensures that the request is built with the correct information.

3. In the ceph_sync_write() function, the patch also moves the ceph_osdc_build_request() call after calculating the number of pages. This ensures that the request is built with the correct alignment and length.

4. In the ceph_osdc_readpages() function, the patch moves the ceph_osdc_build_request() call after determining the final extent. This ensures that the request is built with the correct offset and length.

5. In the ceph_osdc_writepages() function, the patch moves the ceph_osdc_build_request() call after determining the alignment and length of the write. This ensures that the request is built with the correct information.

Overall, the patch seems to improve the order and timing of building the osd request in various functions, which can lead to better performance and correctness. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake processors to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Here is the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake processor by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the intel_pstate_cpu_ids array.
2. The patch uses the same parameters as the INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_GOLDMONT family, indicating that the Gemini Lake processor can be treated similarly to the Goldmont family.
3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Intel, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend that this patch be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for a new processor family, which can improve compatibility and performance for systems using Gemini Lake processors.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new advertising setting called "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" to the Bluetooth subsystem. This setting allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting.

2. The patch modifies the "enable_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" to consider the new "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" setting when determining the connectable state. If the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" bit is set, the controller is set to connectable mode. Otherwise, the previous behavior of checking the global connectable setting is used.

3. The "set_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" is also modified to handle the new "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" setting. If the "cp->val" (value) is 0x02, the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" bit is set. Otherwise, it is cleared. This ensures that the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" setting is properly updated when changing the advertising state.

4. The patch includes appropriate error handling and response sending logic.

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch aims to improve the performance of the `search_memslots` function in the KVM subsystem by adding a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism.
   - It states that in typical guest boot workloads, only 2-3 memslots are extensively used, and the same memslot lookup operation is performed repeatedly.

2. Changes made by the patch:
   - A new field `lru_slot` of type `atomic_t` is added to the `struct kvm_memslots` to store the index of the most recently used memslot.
   - The `search_memslots` function is modified to utilize the LRU cache:
     - It first checks if the requested guest frame number (gfn) falls within the range of the most recently used memslot. If so, it returns the memslot directly.
     - If not, it iterates over all memslots to find the appropriate one and updates the `lru_slot` with the index of the found memslot.

3. Benefits of the patch:
   - The patch claims to improve the average lookup time for the given workload from 46 to 28 cycles, which is approximately a 40% improvement.
   - By caching the most recently used memslot, the patch reduces the need for iterating over all memslots in most cases, resulting in faster lookup operations.

4. Considerations:
   - The patch appears to be well-implemented and addresses a specific performance optimization.
   - It does not introduce any new external dependencies or potential regressions.
   - The changes are localized to the `search_memslots` function and the `struct kvm_memslots`, minimizing the impact on other parts of the codebase.

ACK: Accept the patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch adds a second parent option for the dbg_base_clk in the socfpga clock driver.
   - It allows bypassing the debug base clock from the main PLL to the OSC1 clock.
   - The bypass register is the staysoc1(0x10) register in the clock manager.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch modifies the `clk_periclk_get_parent` function to read the `CLKMGR_DBCTRL` register and return the appropriate parent for the debug base clock.
   - The `clk_periclk_get_parent` function is added to the `periclk_ops` structure as the `get_parent` callback.
   - The `init.parent_names` and `init.num_parents` fields are modified to support multiple parent options for the debug base clock.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch adds functionality to support a second parent option for the debug base clock, allowing bypassing from the main PLL to the OSC1 clock.
   - The code changes appear to be correct and do not introduce any obvious issues.
   - The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch is a valid enhancement to the socfpga clock driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is making a change in the rtl8192_pci_probe() function in the rtl_core.c file of the rtl8192e driver. It adds an error handling mechanism for the register_netdev() function call.

Previously, the register_netdev() function was called without checking its return value. The patch modifies this by adding an if statement to check the return value of register_netdev(). If the return value is non-zero (indicating an error), the code jumps to the err_free_irq label, which presumably handles the error and frees any allocated resources.

This change improves the robustness of the driver by properly handling errors during the registration of the network device. By returning -ENODEV in case of an error, it ensures that the driver behaves correctly when encountering registration failures.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable and necessary improvement to the driver code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces two helper functions, `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser`, for accessing the ITS BASERn register. These functions provide a convenient way to read and write the register value.

2. The `its_read_baser` function takes a pointer to the `its_node` structure and a pointer to the `its_baser` structure as arguments. It calculates the index of the `its_baser` structure within the `its_node` tables array and uses it to read the corresponding register value from the ITS base address.

3. The `its_write_baser` function takes the same arguments as `its_read_baser` along with the value to be written. It calculates the index of the `its_baser` structure and uses it to write the value to the corresponding register. It also updates the `val` field of the `its_baser` structure by calling `its_read_baser` after the write operation.

4. The patch modifies the `its_alloc_tables` function to use the new helper functions. Instead of directly accessing the register using `readq_relaxed` and `writeq_relaxed`, it now uses `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser` to read and write the register values.

5. The `its_alloc_tables` function iterates over the `its_node` tables array and performs various operations on each `its_baser` structure. It reads the current register value using `its_read_baser` and performs calculations based on the value. It then writes the updated value using `its_write_baser` and reads it back using `its_read_baser` to verify the write operation.

6. The patch also removes the assignment of `val` to the `val` field of the `its_baser` structure, as it is now updated by `its_write_baser`.

Overall, the patch introduces helper functions for accessing the ITS BASERn register, which improves code readability and maintainability. It also updates the existing code to use these helper functions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the mx51_clocks_init() function is being converted to a Device Tree (DT) call. This change is being made because the i.MX51 platform is becoming DT only. 

The patch removes the mx51_clocks_init() function and replaces it with a new mx51_clocks_init() function that takes a device node as an argument. The original mx51_clocks_init() function is then renamed to mx51_clocks_init_dt().

The mx51_clocks_init() function initializes clocks for the i.MX51 platform, while the mx51_clocks_init_dt() function is a wrapper that calls the mx51_clocks_init() function with default arguments.

The patch also adds a CLK_OF_DECLARE() macro to register the mx51_clocks_init() function as the clock provider for the "fsl,imx51-ccm" compatible device node.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It updates the code to support the DT-only i.MX51 platform and improves the overall maintainability of the codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing the use of __devinitdata in the staging driver rtl8187se. The reason for this change is that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option, and therefore __devinitdata is no longer needed.

2. The added registers include CODA_CMD_ENC_SEQ_JPG_PARA, CODA_CMD_ENC_SEQ_JPG_RST_INTERVAL, CODA_CMD_ENC_SEQ_JPG_THUMB_EN, CODA_CMD_ENC_SEQ_JPG_THUMB_SIZE, and CODA_CMD_ENC_SEQ_JPG_THUMB_OFFSET.

3. These registers are used for configuring JPEG encoding parameters, reset intervals, thumbnail enablement, size, and offset.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It adds necessary register definitions for JPEG encoding support in the CODA7541 media platform driver, which can enhance the functionality and compatibility of the driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the function signature of `lnet_ping()` by changing the type of the `ids` parameter from `lnet_process_id_t *` to `lnet_process_id_t __user *`. This change properly marks the `ids` parameter as a userspace pointer, which is important for security and correctness.

2. The patch also updates the function call to `lnet_ping()` in the `LNetCtl()` function to pass `data->ioc_pbuf1` directly instead of casting it to `lnet_process_id_t *`. This change ensures that the userspace pointer is passed correctly to `lnet_ping()`.

3. The change in the function signature and the function call is necessary to address sparse warnings about different address spaces, which improves code quality.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be a necessary and correct fix for marking the userspace pointer correctly and addressing sparse warnings. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver for Qualcomm Atheros wireless devices. The patch adds two new event handlers, `wmi_evt_linkup` and `wmi_evt_linkdown`, which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively.

The `wmi_evt_linkup` function is called when a linkup event is received from the firmware. It sets the network device's carrier state to "on" using the `netif_carrier_on` function. This indicates that the data path is ready.

The `wmi_evt_linkdown` function is called when a linkdown event is received from the firmware. It sets the network device's carrier state to "off" using the `netif_carrier_off` function. This indicates that the data path is no longer available.

Considering the functionality provided by this patch, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. The patch adds necessary handling for linkup/linkdown events, which can be crucial for maintaining network connectivity and ensuring proper behavior of the wil6210 driver.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: When power is removed from the device, all SDIO settings return to default. This can cause problems, so the patch aims to fix this issue by reconfiguring after power is reapplied.

2. The patch is signed-off by James Minor and reviewed by Steve deRosier, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

3. The patch adds a new function `ath6kl_sdio_config` which is responsible for configuring the SDIO settings after power is reapplied.

4. The `ath6kl_sdio_power_on` function, which is responsible for powering on the device, now calls the `ath6kl_sdio_config` function after a delay of 10 milliseconds.

5. If the `ath6kl_sdio_config` function fails to configure the SDIO, an error message is printed, and the function returns an error code.

6. The `is_disabled` flag is set to false after successful configuration, indicating that the device is no longer disabled.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a solution by adding a new function and modifying an existing function. It also includes error handling in case the configuration fails. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the condition `path > 0 || tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is being removed and replaced with `path > 0`. The patch also includes a reported-by tag and is signed-off by multiple contributors.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the changes made and their impact on the codebase.

In the original code, the condition `path > 0 || tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is used to check if either `path` is greater than 0 or `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false and sets the `csmi_status` accordingly.

However, the patch removes the `tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` condition, which suggests that it is an impossible condition. This implies that the original code might have contained a logical error or an oversight.

Considering this, it is likely that the patch is correct in removing the `tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` condition. It simplifies the code and removes an unnecessary check.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch modifies the function `host1x_bo_lookup()` in the `gr2d.c` file of the `drivers/gpu/host1x/drm` directory. The purpose of the patch is to fix the return value of the function.

Currently, the function returns 0 when the `gem` object is not found. However, it should return NULL instead. The patch corrects this by changing the return statement from `return 0;` to `return NULL;`.

This change ensures that the function returns the appropriate value when the `gem` object is not found. Returning NULL is more consistent with the expected behavior and improves code readability.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward replacement of the `hid_output_raw_report` function with `hid_hw_output_report` in the `wiimote_hid_send` function of the `hid-wiimote-core.c` file. The patch aims to use the new API where available.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch seems to be a simple and safe change that replaces an outdated function with a newer one. Additionally, it has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, which adds credibility to its acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to set the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer. This is done because the bus frequency is fixed to what is set in the device tree (DT).

2. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and the related code that sets the clock divider based on this frequency.

3. The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is modified to take the frequency as an argument and calculate the clock divider accordingly.

4. The "meson_i2c_xfer" function no longer calls "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" since the clock divider is now set in the probe function.

5. The "meson_i2c_probe" function reads the clock frequency from the device tree and assigns it to the "freq" variable. If the clock frequency is not specified in the device tree, it defaults to "DEFAULT_FREQ".

6. Finally, the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is called in the probe function to set the clock divider based on the frequency obtained from the device tree.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency of the i2c-meson driver by setting the clock divider only once during the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer. This change reduces unnecessary calculations and improves performance. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch changes the log level of error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer object size validation failures from `dev_err` to `dev_dbg`. This means that these messages will no longer be printed as error messages but as debug messages instead.

2. The reason for this change is to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages by validating userspace parameters. By changing the log level to debug, these messages will only be printed if debug logging is enabled, reducing the potential log flooding.

3. The patch has been reviewed by Tomi Valkeinen, who is a maintainer of the drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/omap_fb.c file.

Overall, this patch seems reasonable as it improves the logging behavior and prevents potential log flooding. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

3. The change is a simple modification that does not introduce any new functionality or alter existing behavior. It only modifies the storage class of the variable.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid and beneficial change that improves code quality and maintainability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, considering the removal of unnecessary code and the sign-off by the contributors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` is being moved from the header file `smil.h` to the file `smilsub.c`. This change is made because `ErrXDCode` is only used in `smilsub.c`. Additionally, the patch removes the unnecessary extern declaration of `ErrXDCode` from `smil.h` and `smilmain.c`.

Considering the nature of this patch, it seems to be a clean and straightforward modification that improves code organization and removes unnecessary declarations. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "KVM: VMX: Improve error reporting during invalid guest state emulation." It aims to enhance error reporting to userspace when instruction emulation fails.

In the code changes, the patch adds error reporting logic when the `err` variable is not equal to `EMULATE_DONE`. It sets the `exit_reason` field of the `vcpu->run` structure to `KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR` and the `suberror` field to `KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION`. Additionally, it sets the `ndata` field to 0. This ensures that the error is properly reported to userspace.

The patch also includes a check for pending signals before returning from the function, which is unrelated to the error reporting improvement.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM VMX subsystem. It provides a clear and concise solution without introducing any potential regressions or side effects. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` in the `net/ipv6/raw.c` file. The change involves switching from passing `msg->iov_iter.iov` to passing `msg` itself as an argument.

The patch updates the line `err = memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, from, 0, length);` to `err = memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, msg->msg_iter.iov, 0, length);`. This change ensures that the correct data is copied from the `msg` structure to the `iph` buffer.

Additionally, the patch modifies the line `err = rawv6_send_hdrinc(sk, (struct iovec *)msg->msg_iter.iov, len, &fl6, &dst, msg->msg_flags);` to `err = rawv6_send_hdrinc(sk, msg, len, &fl6, &dst, msg->msg_flags);`. This change passes the `msg` structure directly to the `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` function instead of casting it to `struct iovec`.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a potential issue with copying data from the `msg` structure to the `iph` buffer. It also simplifies the code by directly passing the `msg` structure to the `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` function.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch updates the `chip->lux_scale` value after successfully setting the ALS scale.

4. In the `isl29028_write_raw()` function, the patch removes the duplicate error logging for `isl29028_set_als_scale()`. This is now handled within `isl29028_set_als_scale()` itself.

5. In the `isl29028_chip_init_and_power_on()` function, the patch removes the separate error logging for `isl29028_set_als_scale()`. Instead, it directly returns the error code from `isl29028_set_als_scale()`.

Overall, the patch improves code organization, reduces code duplication, and adds proper error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple typo fix in the zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c files of the zd1211rw driver. The patch corrects the spelling of "reseting" to "resetting" in two different locations.

4. The patch first calls the port driver's .set_termios method before setting or clearing the ASYNC_CTS_FLOW and ASYNC_CHECK_CD flags. This ensures that the termios settings are properly configured based on the available hardware support.

5. The patch also reloads the cflag from termios after calling uart_change_speed(). This is necessary because the port driver may have overridden the flags, and this step ensures that the correct cflag is used for further processing.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the `qos_request` field from `saa7134_fh` structure to `saa7134_dev` structure in `saa7134-video.c` file. This change makes sense because `qos_request` is a global field and not specific to a file handle.

2. In the `saa7134_streamon` function, the `pm_qos_add_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the `qos_request` field is accessed correctly.

3. Similarly, in the `saa7134_streamoff` function, the `pm_qos_remove_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the correct `qos_request` field is removed.

4. In `saa7134.h`, the `qos_request` field is removed from the `saa7134_fh` structure since it is now part of the `saa7134_dev` structure.

Overall, the patch improves the code by correctly accessing and managing the `qos_request` field. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the `nand_bbt.c` file of the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem. It introduces changes to handle ECC errors differently when scanning for simple bad block markers.

The patch adds checks to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers. It does this by checking the return value of `mtd->read_oob()` function calls. If the return value is `-EUCLEAN` or `-EBADMSG`, indicating an ECC error, the patch returns 0, effectively ignoring the error. This change is made in three places within the code.

The rationale behind this change is that when scanning for simple bad block markers, reacting to ECC errors is not useful because the assumption is that the relevant markers are still non-0xFF for true bad blocks.

Overall, the patch seems reasonable and addresses a specific scenario where ignoring ECC errors is appropriate. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is specific to the MIPS architecture, specifically the Sibyte platform.

2. The patch moves the bus watcher initialization from the deprecated __initcall to device_initcall.

3. The __initcall macro is used to mark functions that are only called during the kernel initialization phase and are not needed afterwards. However, it is deprecated and discouraged from use.

4. The device_initcall macro is used to register a function to be called during device initialization. This is the recommended way to initialize device-specific functionality.

5. The change does not modify any existing functionality but improves the code by using the recommended initialization method.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean and necessary improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch enables setting the minimum inline header mode for Virtual Functions (VFs) in the mlx5 driver.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to modify the minimum inline header mode for a specific VF.
   - The function takes the mlx5_core_dev structure, VF vport number, and the desired minimum inline value as input.
   - It constructs the necessary input parameters for the `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` function and calls it to modify the VF's minimum inline header mode.
   - The `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` function is not included in this patch, so we assume it already exists in the codebase.

3. Functionality:
   - The patch adds the ability to modify the minimum inline header mode for VFs in the mlx5 driver.
   - This feature allows fine-grained control over the amount of data that can be included in the inline header of a VF's packet.
   - By setting the minimum inline value, the driver can optimize the packet processing and reduce the number of additional memory accesses.

4. Code Quality:
   - The code changes appear to be well-written and follow the coding style of the mlx5 driver.
   - The patch includes the necessary header file modifications and function prototypes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a useful feature to the mlx5 driver, allowing the modification of the minimum inline header mode for VFs, which can improve performance and efficiency.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "Btrfs: fix freeze vs auto defrag," indicating that it addresses an issue related to freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature.

2. The patch modifies the function `__btrfs_run_defrag_inode` in the `fs/btrfs/file.c` file.

3. The patch adds two lines of code before and after the `btrfs_defrag_file` function call. These lines start and end a write operation on the superblock (`sb`) of the file system.

4. The purpose of starting and ending the write operation on the superblock is to prevent the auto defragmentation from running when the file system is frozen.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch correctly addresses the issue of freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to simplify the ternary operators in the mwifiex_config_scan() function in the mwifiex/scan.c file. It replaces the ternary operators with the GNU extension "x ?: y" syntax, which simplifies the code.

The patch has been reviewed by Julian Calaby and signed-off by Andreas Fenkart and Kalle Valo, indicating that it has undergone a review process and received approval from the relevant individuals.

The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of the code. They only simplify the existing code, making it more concise and readable.

Therefore, considering the review and the nature of the changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to clean up manual bias level transitions in the ASoC adau17x1 CODEC driver. This improves code readability and reduces code length, which is generally desirable.

2. The patch sets the suspend_bias_off flag to true in the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures. This change replaces the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the suspend function. By using the suspend_bias_off flag, the code becomes shorter and cleaner.

3. The patch removes the suspend function adau17x1_suspend from the adau17x1 CODEC driver. Instead, it directly sets the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the resume function. This change simplifies the code and eliminates the need for a separate suspend function.

4. The patch also removes the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in the resume function. This is because the suspend_bias_off flag is set to true, which automatically sets the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY when resuming.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves code organization and readability.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean-up and code improvement, without any potential negative impact. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes are adjusting the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. The purpose of these changes is to improve the encoded output using the default settings.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The changes seem to be beneficial as they aim to enhance the default behavior of the driver, potentially improving the overall performance and user experience.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` and `.bus` fields for the `b53_spi_driver` structure in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver for the Linux kernel. The reason for this removal is that the `module_spi_driver()` function is used, which automatically sets these fields.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of these fields is justified since they are redundant and can be automatically set by the `module_spi_driver()` function. Removing redundant code can help improve code readability and maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix to use the correct format specifier for the size_t type in the debug and warning messages. The patch replaces the "%d" specifier with "%zd" in two places.

Since this patch only fixes a formatting issue and does not introduce any functional changes or potential regressions, it can be considered a safe and straightforward fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the file `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/subdev/fb/ramnva3.c`, which is part of the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the Nouveau graphics driver.

2. The changes in lines 7-9 update the values of three register variables (`ram->fuc.r_0x100760`, `ram->fuc.r_0x1007a0`, and `ram->fuc.r_0x1007e0`) using the `ramfuc_stride` function. This function calculates the register value based on a given stride and the partition mask of the `ram` object.

3. Similarly, the change in line 12 updates the value of `ram->fuc.r_0x1110e0` using the `ramfuc_stride` function.

4. The changes in lines 10 and 13 update the values of `ram->fuc.r_0x100760` and `ram->fuc.r_0x1110e0` respectively, using the `ramfuc_reg` function. These changes are unrelated to the main purpose of the patch.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug. It appears to be a code optimization or cleanup.

Based on the analysis, the patch seems to be a safe and reasonable improvement to the code. It does not introduce any regressions or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event`. This change is made because the name `pga_event` was misleading. Renaming the function improves code clarity and maintainability.

2. The `pga_event` function is used as an event handler for the OUT_DRV widgets. The patch updates the function name in the code to reflect its purpose accurately.

3. The patch removes the `mute` variable from the `struct twl6040_output`. However, since this change is not related to the function name update, it is not relevant to the decision of accepting the patch.

4. The patch updates the widget definitions in the `twl6040_dapm_widgets` array to use the renamed `out_drv_event` function instead of the old `pga_event` function. This ensures consistency and correctness in the code.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity by renaming the function and updating the widget definitions accordingly. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues. Therefore, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds support for reading the micbias voltage from the device property for the max98090 codec.
2. It introduces a new optional property "maxim,micbias" in the device tree bindings for the max98090 codec.
3. The property defines valid voltage values for the micbias voltage.
4. In the max98090_probe() function, the patch reads the "maxim,micbias" property using device_property_read_u32() and assigns it to the micbias variable.
5. If the property is not found, it sets the micbias to the default value of M98090_MBVSEL_2V8 (2.8v) and prints a dev_info message.
6. If the property is found but the value is out of the valid range, it sets the micbias to the default value of M98090_MBVSEL_2V8 (2.8v) and prints a dev_err message.
7. Finally, it updates the micbias voltage using snd_soc_update_bits() with the micbias value.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for reading the micbias voltage from the device property, which enhances the functionality and flexibility of the max98090 codec driver. Additionally, it handles cases where the property is not found or has an invalid value, ensuring proper behavior and error reporting.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there was a regression introduced by the commit d0b1252d for refactoring simple_hdmi*(). The pin NID was not assigned correctly. 

The patch fixes this issue by correctly assigning the pin NID in the patch_hdmi.c file. The line `spec->cvts[0].cvt_nid = pin_nid;` is replaced with `spec->pins[0].pin_nid = pin_nid;`.

Given that this patch addresses a regression and fixes a specific issue reported by Annie Liu, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any new issues or conflicts with other parts of the codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers: "dcssblk" and "xpram". The "owner" field is typically used to keep track of the module that owns the driver.

In this case, the patch is removing the assignment of "owner" to "THIS_MODULE" in both drivers. This suggests that the drivers do not need to explicitly set the "owner" field, as it will be populated by the driver core.

Given this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the unnecessary "owner" assignment does not affect the functionality of the drivers and aligns with the standard practice of relying on the driver core to populate the "owner" field.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture for the leon_callin() function. The warning indicates a mismatch between the __cpuinit and __init annotations for the leon_configure_cache_smp() function.

The patch modifies the declaration of leon_configure_cache_smp() to use the __cpuinit annotation instead of __init. This change ensures that the function is only called during CPU initialization and not during normal system operation.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a section mismatch warning and the correctness of the change, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue and improves the code's maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `ion_chunk_heap_create` function in the `ion_chunk_heap.c` file under the `drivers/staging/android/ion` directory. The change is to replace the `pr_info` call with `pr_debug` for printing the heap creation details.

The reason for this change is to ensure that success messages are logged at the appropriate debug level instead of the info level. This aligns with best practices for logging in the Linux kernel.

By using `pr_debug` instead of `pr_info`, the success message will only be printed when the kernel is compiled with the `DEBUG` configuration option enabled. This helps reduce unnecessary log noise in production systems.

Overall, this change is a simple and straightforward improvement to the codebase, ensuring that log messages are appropriately categorized. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of definitions for the contiguous bit in the arm64 architecture's page table entries (PTE) and page middle directory (PMD). 

The patch defines the bit positions for the contiguous bit in both PTE and PMD structures. It also defines the numerical offset of the PTE within a range of contiguous PTEs.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are resource-managed functions provided by the kernel. This conversion helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

The devm_kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the adt7411_data structure. This function automatically frees the memory when the device is unregistered, eliminating the need for manual memory deallocation.

The error handling in the probe function has been improved. Instead of using a goto statement to jump to the exit_free label, the function now returns the error code directly. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

Similarly, in the remove function, the data structure is no longer freed explicitly using kfree. The memory will be automatically freed when the device is unregistered.

Overall, this patch improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of resource leaks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks for the `moboard_uart0` function in `mach-mx31moboard.c`. These callbacks were responsible for initializing and cleaning up the UART0 device. The removal suggests that the initialization and cleanup are no longer necessary.

2. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is modified to remove the return type `int` and instead use `void`. This change indicates that the function no longer returns an error code.

3. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is modified to directly check the return value of `gpio_request()` and perform the necessary operations accordingly. This change simplifies the code by removing the need for an explicit return statement.

4. The `moboard_uart0_exit()` function is removed entirely, indicating that the cleanup of the UART0 device is no longer required.

5. The `uart0_pdata` structure is modified to remove the `init` and `exit` function pointers, as they are no longer used.

6. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is called during the initialization of the `mx31moboard` device.

7. The `serial_imx_probe()` function no longer checks for the presence of `init` and `exit` function pointers in the `pdata` structure. This change suggests that the initialization and cleanup of the UART device are no longer necessary.

8. The `serial_imx_probe()` function directly calls `uart_add_one_port()` without checking for errors. This change simplifies the code by removing the need for an explicit error handling block.

9. The `serial_imx_remove()` function no longer checks for the presence of `exit` function pointer in the `pdata` structure. This change suggests that the cleanup of the UART device is no longer necessary.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch removes unnecessary initialization and cleanup code for the UART0 device. The changes simplify the code and do not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the VIDIOC_TRY_FMT function in the coda.c file of the media subsystem. The issue is that the sizeimage field is incorrectly calculated as height * bytesperline, instead of width * height * 3 / 2.

2. The patch correctly updates the sizeimage field to be calculated as width * height * 3 / 2, which is the correct formula for YUV420 format.

3. The patch also updates the vidioc_s_fmt function to set the sizeimage field based on the value provided in the v4l2_format structure, rather than calculating it based on the format type.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and a tested-by tag.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a correct fix. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC. This change allows for better parameter handling and documentation.

2. The patch introduces a new module parameter named "tx_buffers" to set the number of transmit USB buffers. This provides flexibility for users to configure the driver according to their requirements.

3. The patch adds a check to ensure that the user does not set the "tx_buffers" parameter beyond the defined limits of the driver. This prevents any potential issues caused by invalid buffer configurations.

4. The patch modifies the "device_set_options" function to use the new "tx_buffers" parameter value when setting the number of transmit buffers. If the user-provided value is within the defined limits, it is used; otherwise, the default value is used.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests using the devm_* APIs in the ad5504 driver of the iio subsystem. The devm_* APIs are device-managed APIs that simplify the code and handle resource management automatically. This improves the code's robustness and reduces the chances of resource leaks.

The patch replaces the allocation of the iio device using iio_device_alloc with devm_iio_device_alloc. This ensures that the iio device is automatically freed when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

Similarly, the patch replaces the usage of regulator_get and regulator_put with devm_regulator_get. This ensures that the regulator is automatically released when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

The patch also replaces the usage of request_threaded_irq and free_irq with devm_request_threaded_irq. This ensures that the interrupt is automatically freed when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the devm_* APIs, which simplifies resource management and reduces the chances of resource leaks. Therefore, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations. This change improves code organization and makes it consistent with other subsystems like `fsl_msi`.

2. The patch iterates over all controllers and populates them with the MSI operations. This ensures that the MSI operations are correctly set up for each controller.

3. The patch also updates the `setup_msi_irqs` and `teardown_msi_irqs` function pointers in the `pci_controller_ops` structure for each controller. This ensures that the correct MSI setup and teardown functions are used for each controller.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves code organization and ensures correct MSI operations for the u3 MPIC subsystem.

2. The base VF id is already stored in the HW struct, so there is no need to read it again.
3. The code is modified to use the stored base VF id instead of reading it from the register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a valid optimization that avoids unnecessary register reads. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary. This optimization is beneficial when there are no starved devices, as there is no need to iterate over them.

2. The patch splits the scsi_run_queue function into two separate functions: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue. This improves code clarity and makes the functions more focused on their specific tasks.

3. The scsi_starved_list_run function handles the iteration over starved devices and moves them to a temporary list for processing.

4. The scsi_run_queue function now checks if the scsi_target has a single LUN and calls scsi_single_lun_run accordingly. It also checks if the starved_list is not empty and calls scsi_starved_list_run to process the starved devices.

5. Finally, the patch calls blk_run_queue to start a new request if possible.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency of scsi_run_queue by avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and splitting the function into more focused parts. It also handles starved devices separately, improving the overall performance of the SCSI subsystem.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Since this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally accepted in stable releases as they improve code maintainability and readability without introducing any risk of regressions.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` field from the `sl811h_driver` structure in the `sl811-hcd.c` file. The patch claims that there is no need to set the `.owner` field explicitly as the core will handle it automatically.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. The purpose of the `.owner` field: The `.owner` field is used to keep track of the module that "owns" the driver structure. It is typically set using the `THIS_MODULE` macro to ensure proper reference counting and module handling.

2. The impact of removing the `.owner` field: If the `.owner` field is removed, it means that the ownership tracking of the driver structure will not be handled automatically by the core. This could potentially lead to issues with reference counting and module handling.

3. The rationale provided in the patch: The patch claims that there is no need to set the `.owner` field explicitly as the core will handle it automatically. However, it does not provide any specific details or justification for this claim.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend a NAK (not accepting) for this patch. Removing the `.owner` field without proper justification could introduce potential issues with module handling and reference counting. It is important to ensure that the ownership tracking of the driver structure is handled correctly to maintain the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple change in the ARM amba driver for the netx platform. The patch removes the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field of the fb_device structure and only assigns NETX_IRQ_LCD as the interrupt value.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function called `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0 immediately.

3. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device associated with the given `ifindex`.

4. If a valid network device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the master index of the device.

5. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index.

6. Additionally, the patch includes a duplicate definition of the `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` function with an empty implementation. This duplicate definition should be removed.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It adds a useful helper function for looking up the l3mdev master index, which can be beneficial for certain network-related operations. However, the duplicate definition of `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` should be removed before merging the patch.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only adds a workaround to handle the spurious irq issue.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the mentioned issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is introducing a change to the qla2xxx SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the *_id functions (qla2x00_gpn_id, qla2x00_gnn_id, and qla2x00_gfpn_id) to stop iteration after the first failure.

The patch includes break statements after the failure conditions in each of the *_id functions. This change ensures that the iteration stops immediately after encountering the first failure, rather than continuing to process subsequent entries in the list.

Considering the nature of the change and the provided code snippet, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Stopping iteration after the first failure can help improve efficiency and prevent unnecessary processing in the *_id functions.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the entire patch, including its impact on other parts of the codebase and potential side effects, should be conducted before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch: The patch adds missing inline wrappers for nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64. These wrappers are required for netlink applications in the nl802154 subsystem to access fields in little-endian byte order.

2. Justification: The 802.15.4 MAC byte order is little endian, and to maintain consistency, the address configuration fields need to be in the same byte order as they come from the MAC layer. Therefore, these inline wrappers are necessary to provide access to these fields for nl802154 userspace applications.

3. Code changes: The patch adds two new inline functions, nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64, to the netlink.h header file. These functions return the payload of __le32 and __le64 attributes, respectively.

4. Impact: The patch does not introduce any significant changes or potential issues. It only adds missing inline wrappers, which are required for proper functionality in the nl802154 subsystem.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch removes the 'thisboard' macro, which relies on a local variable with a specific name and yields a pointer derived from that variable.
2. Instead of using the macro, the patch introduces a local variable 'thisboard' and assigns it the value obtained from the 'comedi_board()' helper function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch improves code readability and eliminates reliance on a specific variable name, making the code more maintainable. Additionally, it uses the recommended 'comedi_board()' helper function to obtain the pointer, ensuring consistency with other parts of the codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new property called "phy-reset-duration" for device tree probe. This property allows boards to specify a longer reset duration for the phy if needed. This is a useful addition as different boards may require different reset durations.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the "phy-reset-duration" property is only used if the "phy-reset-gpios" property is available. This ensures that the reset duration is only applied when the phy reset GPIO is specified.

3. The patch sets a default reset duration of 1 millisecond if the "phy-reset-duration" property is not present or if the value is greater than 1000 (which is considered invalid). This ensures that a reasonable default value is used in such cases.

4. The patch modifies the "fec_reset_phy" function to read the "phy-reset-duration" property and use it as the reset duration. The function also includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not longer than 1 second.

Overall, this patch adds a useful feature to the Linux kernel by allowing boards to specify a custom reset duration for the phy. It includes proper checks and defaults to ensure safe and reasonable behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch aims to convert the comedi_subdevice access from pointer math to array access in the pcmad driver. This change replaces the line `s = dev->subdevices + 0;` with `s = &dev->subdevices[0];`.

The use of pointer math can be error-prone and harder to understand, especially when dealing with arrays. By using array access, the code becomes more readable and less prone to mistakes.

Additionally, this change does not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of the driver. It only improves the code's clarity and maintainability.

Therefore, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple constification of the `nct7802_regmap_config` struct in the `hwmon/nct7802.c` file. The patch changes the declaration of `nct7802_regmap_config` from a non-const struct to a const struct.

Since the `regmap_config` struct is not modified by the driver and `regmap_init()` accepts a pointer to const, constifying the struct seems reasonable and safe. This change does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, but it improves code clarity and helps prevent accidental modifications to the struct.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

   - drivers/net/hyperv/netvsc.c:
     - Line 440: The patch modifies the initialization of the MTU value in the nvsp_message structure. It adds ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length) to the net_device->ndev->mtu value.
   
   - drivers/net/hyperv/netvsc_drv.c:
     - Line 699: The patch modifies the netvsc_change_mtu function. It updates the limit value for MTU based on the nvsp_version. For NVSPv2, it subtracts ETH_HLEN from NETVSC_MTU.
     - Line 702: It adds a check to ensure that the MTU is not less than ETH_DATA_LEN (1500) for Hyper-V hosts.

   - drivers/net/hyperv/rndis_filter.c:
     - Line 998-1007: The patch adds code to retrieve the MTU value from the host using the RNDIS_OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_FRAME_SIZE query. If successful, it updates the net_device->ndev->mtu value.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and code changes, it appears that this patch addresses the scenario where the host reduces the MTU due to encapsulation. It updates the MTU value in the appropriate structures and ensures that the MTU is within the supported range. The changes seem reasonable and relevant to handle this specific scenario.

5. Conclusion:
   Considering the analysis, it is recommended to accept this Linux kernel patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses the issue of handling the MTU reduced by the host in the Hyper-V network driver.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information and may require further review or testing before final acceptance.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `sirfsoc_uart_set_termios` function in `sirfsoc_uart.c`. It removes the variable `ioclk_rate` and the associated lookup table for baud rate calculation. Instead, it introduces a check for the `uartclk` value being equal to 150000000 (150MHz) before performing the fast calculation for baud rate. If `uartclk` is not equal to 150000000, it falls back to the `sirfsoc_calc_sample_div` function for rate calculation.

2. The patch also modifies the `sirfsoc_uart_probe` function in `sirfsoc_uart.c`. It adds code to retrieve the `clk` for the device and store it in the `sirfport` structure. It then enables the clock and sets the `uartclk` value to the rate of the clock.

3. The `sirfsoc_uart_remove` function in `sirfsoc_uart.c` is also modified by the patch. It disables and releases the clock obtained in the `sirfsoc_uart_probe` function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) for the following reasons:

- The patch improves the accuracy of baud rate calculation by considering the actual clock frequency (`uartclk`) instead of assuming it to be 150MHz.
- It introduces proper clock handling by retrieving, enabling, and disabling the clock in the probe and remove functions.
- The changes are specific to the `sirfsoc_uart` driver and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

However, it is important to note that this recommendation is based solely on the provided patch and its analysis. It is always advisable to consider the broader context, including testing and feedback from other developers, before making a final decision.

4. The patch updates the condition `num_drc_entries <= max_drc_entries` to use `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries) <= max_drc_entries` in the `prune_bucket` function, ensuring atomicity.

5. The patch updates the `nfsd_reply_cache_count` function to return the value of `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)` instead of acquiring and releasing a spinlock.

6. The patch updates the `nfsd_cache_search` function to use `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)` instead of `num_drc_entries` for comparison and assignment.

7. The patch updates the increment operation `++num_drc_entries` to use `atomic_inc(&num_drc_entries)`, ensuring atomicity.

8. The patch updates the `nfsd_reply_cache_stats_show` function to use `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)` instead of `num_drc_entries` for printing the number of entries.

Overall, the patch replaces spinlocks with atomic operations, improving concurrency and eliminating potential race conditions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch exports the symbol `confirm_error_lock` using `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`. This allows other parts of the kernel to access and use this symbol.

2. The reason for exporting `confirm_error_lock` is to enable the use of `eeh_serialize_lock()` and `eeh_serialize_unlock()` functions in the PCI surprise hot remove path. These functions freeze the affected PE (PCIe Endpoint) to avoid races due to multiple error reports.

3. The patch is signed-off by two developers, Gavin Shan and Michael Ellerman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change is made in the `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c` file, which suggests that it is specific to the PowerPC architecture.

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to ensure that gpio_chip .get() calls can return negative error codes and propagate them to drivers. This is an important requirement for proper error handling.

2. The patch modifies the rb532_gpio_get() function in the rb532/gpio.c file. It changes the return statement from "return rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);" to "return !!rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);". This change clamps the return value to either 0 or 1 using the "!!" design pattern.

3. The change ensures that the return value of rb532_get_bit() is converted to a boolean value (0 or 1) before being returned. This clamping is necessary to comply with the requirement of returning only 0 or 1 as specified in the patch description.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Linus Walleij and Ralf Baechle, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Considering the importance of proper error handling and the simplicity of the change, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds error handling for the clk_prepare_enable() function in the twl6040_power() function of the twl6040 driver in the mfd subsystem.

2. The patch checks the return value of clk_prepare_enable() and if it fails (returns a non-zero value), it sets the power_count variable to 0 and jumps to the "out" label, effectively propagating the error.

3. This error handling ensures that if clk_prepare_enable() fails, the power_count variable is reset to 0, preventing any subsequent operations from assuming that the clock is enabled when it is not.

4. By adding this error handling, the patch improves the robustness and reliability of the twl6040 driver by properly handling clock enable failures.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to auto-mute or auto-mic functionality when a jack is retasked as a different direction. It ensures that when a jack is retasked as an input or output, it is not counted as the target for automatic jack switching.

The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` function to skip the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed. It checks if the pin is retasked as an input and continues to the next pin if it is. This prevents the pin from being detected as present.

Similarly, the patch modifies the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function to skip the detection of pins retasked as outputs. It checks if the pin is retasked as an output and continues to the next entry if it is. This ensures that only the appropriate pins are considered for auto-switching.

Overall, the patch improves the accuracy of auto-mute and auto-mic functionality by excluding retasked pins from the detection process. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is adding a missing cmpxchg64() function if CONFIG_RMW_INSNS=y. This suggests that the patch is addressing a bug or an issue related to the cmpxchg64() function.

2. The error message indicates that the cmpxchg64() function is not declared, which implies that it is missing in the code.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the arch/m68k/include/asm/cmpxchg.h file, which is the relevant location for the cmpxchg64() function.

Considering these points, it appears that the patch is fixing a missing function declaration and correctly mapping it to the existing implementation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HID (Human Interface Device) driver for RMI (Resistive Multi-Touch) touchpads. It modifies the code to calculate the location of query 8 dynamically instead of hardcoding the offset.

The current implementation assumes that query 6 is always present, and if gestures are supported, it reads query 8 to determine if query 10 exists. However, if a touchpad does not report relative data, query 6 will not be present, and the address of query 8 will be one less.

The patch adjusts the code to calculate the location of query 8 based on the presence of query registers. It uses the "query_offset" variable to dynamically calculate the address of query 8, taking into account the presence of query 6 and gestures.

This change ensures that the code handles touchpads correctly, regardless of whether they support gestures or not. It improves the reliability and compatibility of the HID driver for RMI touchpads.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose and the improvement it brings, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch moves the 64-bit feature fixup earlier in the code, specifically to the early_setup() function. This change ensures that the feature fixups are applied before turning on the MMU, which can have an impact on MMU management and interrupts. This aligns the behavior of 64-bit with what is already done for 32-bit.

2. The patch includes the necessary function call to apply_feature_fixups() in the early_setup() function. This ensures that all dynamic patching is applied at the appropriate time.

3. The patch removes the redundant call to apply_feature_fixups() in the setup_system() function. Since the feature fixups have already been applied in the early_setup() function, there is no need to apply them again in the setup_system() function.

Overall, the patch improves the order of operations and ensures that the feature fixups are applied at the correct time. It also removes redundant code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the zl10353_read_snr() function in the zl10353.c file, which is a driver for a DVB frontend device.

2. The purpose of the patch is to change the way SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is reported. Instead of using raw hardware register values, the patch suggests reporting SNR in a 0.1 dB scale.

3. The patch achieves this by modifying the calculation of the SNR value. It multiplies the raw SNR value (_snr) by 10 and divides it by 8, effectively converting it to a 0.1 dB scale.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or major changes. It only modifies the way SNR is reported, which is a reasonable improvement.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and reasonable improvement to the zl10353 driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds more register documentation for the IRQC driver, including the definitions for various registers.

Since this patch is purely a documentation update and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a low-risk change. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a "line over 80" issue in the comedi driver for the adv_pci1710 device. The change involves removing a comment and reformatting the code.

Since this patch only addresses a coding style issue and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for maintaining code readability or fixing build warnings/errors.

Therefore, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set.

This fix ensures that the code compiles correctly in both cases, with and without CONFIG_OF.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Therefore, this patch is a valid fix for a build error and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store` function in the `toshiba-apci.c` file. The change is in the if condition that checks the value of the `mode` variable. 

Before the patch, the condition was:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 && (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

After the patch, the condition becomes:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1  || (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

The change replaces the logical AND (`&&`) operator with a logical OR (`||`) operator. This means that the condition will now return true if either the `sscanf` function fails to read an integer from the `buf` string or if the `mode` variable is not equal to 2 or 1.

The original condition was incorrect because it would always evaluate to true. If `mode` is not equal to 2, it would be equal to 1, and vice versa. Therefore, the condition would never be false.

The patch fixes this issue by using the logical OR operator, which allows the condition to be true if either of the sub-conditions is true. This change ensures that the condition is correctly checking if `mode` is not equal to 2 or 1.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential bug in the code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward change to staticize local symbols in the `dcp.c` file of the crypto subsystem. The patch makes the `global_dev` variable static and also staticizes the `dcp_dma_unmap`, `dcp_dma_map`, and `dcp_watchdog` functions.

Considering that these symbols are only referenced within the `dcp.c` file, making them static is a good practice to limit their visibility and avoid potential symbol clashes with other parts of the kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the local variable 'status' from the function lancer_cmd_get_file_len() in the be_ethtool.c file. The function uses lancer_cmd_read_object() to get the current size of registers for ethtool registers dump. The returned status value is stored in the 'status' variable but is not checked. However, the check itself is not necessary as the 'data_read' output variable is initialized to 0. Therefore, the 'status' variable can be safely removed.

The patch has been signed-off by Ivan Vecera and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

2. The `spi_sync_transfer()` function is a standard helper function for SPI transfers in the Linux kernel. It ensures proper synchronization and error handling during SPI communication.

3. The patch removes the unnecessary `spi_message` and `spi_message_add_tail` code, which simplifies the implementation.

4. The `spi_sync_transfer()` function is used with the appropriate parameters (`st->us` and `&xfer`) to perform the SPI transfer.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves the code by using a standard helper function.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that simplifies the code without introducing any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to turn off the voltage for thermistors by asking the MSIC (Multi-Source Interrupt Controller) to turn it off instead of complaining about it being on. This is expected to save power.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `mid_initialize_adc` function in the `intel_mid_thermal.c` file. It replaces the warning message about the ADCTHERM already being set with code that clears the MSIC_ADCTHERM_MASK bit and writes the updated data to the INTEL_MSIC_ADC1CNTL3 register.

3. Rationale: The patch addresses a power-saving improvement by directly turning off the voltage for thermistors. It eliminates the need for a warning message and instead takes action to disable the voltage. This change is expected to be beneficial and does not introduce any obvious negative side effects.

4. Sign-offs and Acknowledgments: The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Mika Westerberg, Kirill A. Shutemov, Alan Cox, Durgadoss R, H. Peter Anvin, Matthew Garrett, and Andrew Morton. The presence of these sign-offs and acknowledgments indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup error codes in hv.c." This suggests that it aims to improve error handling in the vmbus driver.

2. The patch includes changes to the `hv_post_message` function in `hv.c`. This function is responsible for posting a message to the Hyper-V host.

3. In the original code, if the payload size exceeds the maximum allowed size (`HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT`), the function returns -1. This is not a descriptive error code and does not provide any information about the error.

4. The patch replaces the return value of -1 with the `EMSGSIZE` error code. `EMSGSIZE` indicates that the message size is too large. This change provides a more meaningful error code, making it easier to understand and handle the error.

5. Additionally, the patch also handles the case where memory allocation fails (`kmalloc` returns NULL). In the original code, it returns -1, which again does not provide any specific information about the error. The patch changes the return value to `ENOMEM`, which indicates a memory allocation failure.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves error handling by using appropriate error codes.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to error handling in the vmbus driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

5. The patch modifies the sierra_device structure to include the newly added chars_in_buffer function, ensuring that it is properly called when needed.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-written and addresses a specific issue in the sierra driver. It has been reviewed and approved by both the author and a respected kernel maintainer. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple change to the "rx51_aux_dev" structure in the "rx51.c" file of the ASoC (Audio for System on Chip) subsystem. The patch changes the visibility of the "rx51_aux_dev" structure from global to static.

In general, making variables static is a good practice as it limits their visibility to the current file, reducing the risk of unintended access or modification from other parts of the codebase. This can help improve code maintainability and reduce potential bugs.

Considering the nature of this patch and the fact that it does not introduce any functional changes, it seems safe to accept it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the efficiency of calculating averages in the cpuidle menu governor by using shifts instead of do_div when the divisor is a power of two. This optimization is expected to be beneficial in most cases.

2. The patch introduces a new macro, INTERVAL_SHIFT, which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the intervals. It is set to 3, which means INTERVALS is defined as (1UL << 3), resulting in 8 intervals.

3. In the get_typical_interval() function, the patch checks if the divisor is equal to INTERVALS. If true, it performs a right shift of avg and stddev by INTERVAL_SHIFT instead of using do_div. This optimization takes advantage of the fact that INTERVALS is a power of two.

4. If the divisor is not equal to INTERVALS, the patch falls back to using do_div for calculating avg and stddev.

5. The patch also updates the comments to reflect the changes made.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable optimization that can improve the performance of the cpuidle menu governor. It introduces a small code change and maintains backward compatibility. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch fixes a bug in the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the arch/x86/kernel/uprobes.c file.
2. Currently, the function changes the task's state even if the ->pre_xol() hook fails. However, the only ->pre_xol() hook cannot fail, so this behavior doesn't matter.
3. The patch addresses this issue by checking if the ->pre_xol() hook exists and calling it. If it returns an error, the function returns the error instead of changing the task's state.
4. This change ensures that if the ->pre_xol() hook fails in the future, the task's state will not be changed, allowing for a proper restart.
5. The patch has been reviewed by Jim Keniston and Oleg Nesterov, and it has been signed-off by Oleg Nesterov.

Considering the bug fix and the review process, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch also removes the usage of 'ai_continuous' in the code and replaces it with the appropriate condition based on 'stop_src'.

Reasoning:
1. The removal of 'ai_continuous' from the private data structure simplifies the code and reduces unnecessary duplication.
2. The suggested approach of determining 'ai_continuous' from 'stop_src' is more efficient and avoids potential inconsistencies.
3. The changes made by the patch do not introduce any new functionality or behavior. They only improve the existing code by removing redundant variables.

Therefore, the patch appears to be a clean and beneficial improvement to the codebase, and it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the `_regulator_do_set_voltage` function, ensuring that the impact is limited to this specific area.

Overall, the patch improves code readability and maintainability without introducing any new risks or issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch enables support for the standard "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property in the opal rtc driver.
2. The patch adds support for the "wakeup-source" property, which indicates that the RTC can be used as a wakeup source.
3. The patch checks if the device has the "wakeup-source" property or the "has-tpo" property (legacy) in its device tree node.
4. If either property is present, the device is marked as wakeup capable, and the appropriate operations for reading and setting the alarm are set.

Overall, this patch adds support for the new standard property while maintaining compatibility with the legacy property. It ensures that the opal rtc driver can be used as a wakeup source. Therefore, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a function `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon` directory. This function allows forcing a performance level via sysfs.

2. The function takes two parameters: `rdev` (a pointer to the `radeon_device` structure) and `level` (an enum representing the forced performance level).

3. Inside the function, it retrieves the current power state and performance level of the device.

4. Depending on the `level` parameter, the function sends messages to the SMC (System Management Controller) to set the forced and enabled performance levels accordingly.

5. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_HIGH`, it sets the enabled levels to 0 and the forced levels to 1.

6. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_LOW`, it sets the forced levels to 0 and the enabled levels to the maximum performance level count minus 1.

7. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_AUTO`, it sets both the forced and enabled levels to 0.

8. After setting the levels, it updates the `forced_level` field in the `radeon_device` structure.

9. The patch also adds a declaration of the `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` function in the `radeon_asic.c` and `radeon_asic.h` files.

false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch removes the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function. It is mentioned that the driver never uses `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, so there is no need to set the data using `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`. 

Removing unnecessary code can improve code readability and maintainability. Since the patch does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues, it can be considered safe to include in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the spin lock in the ramoops driver. Currently, the spin_lock_init() function is called before the kmalloc() function, which allocates memory for cxt->pstore.buf. If the memory allocation fails, there is no need to initialize the spin lock.

The patch moves the spin_lock_init() function call after the error checking for the memory allocation. This ensures that the spin lock is only initialized if the memory allocation is successful.

By making this change, the patch improves the code's robustness and avoids unnecessary spin lock initialization in case of a memory allocation failure.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the log messages in the exynos_cpufreq_scale function to use the dev_err/info functions instead of pr_err/info. This change ensures that accurate log messages with the device name are displayed.

2. The patch adds a new member, "dev," to the exynos_dvfs_info structure. This member is used to store a reference to the device associated with the exynos_info structure.

3. In the exynos_cpufreq_scale function, the dev_err function is used to display an error message when setting the CPU voltage fails. This change ensures that the error message includes the device name.

4. In the exynos_cpufreq_probe function, the "dev" member of the exynos_info structure is assigned the value of "&pdev->dev." This change allows the dev_err function to be used with the correct device reference.

5. The patch also updates the error messages in the exynos_cpufreq_probe function to use the dev_err function instead of pr_err. This change ensures that the error messages include the device name.

Overall, the patch improves the accuracy of log messages by including the device name and ensures that error messages are associated with the correct device. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing a resource management issue related to clock handling.

2. The use of `devm_clk_get()` indicates that the clock resource is managed using the managed resource framework (`devm_*` functions). This framework automatically handles resource cleanup, which reduces the risk of resource leaks and simplifies error handling.

3. The patch is specific to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the Renesas R-Car platform. It modifies the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function to use `devm_clk_get()` instead of `clk_get()` when obtaining the clock for the SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface) device.

4. The patch also removes the call to `clk_put()` in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the clock resource is now managed by the managed resource framework, and manual cleanup is no longer necessary.

Overall, the patch improves resource management by using the managed resource framework for clock handling. It is a targeted and safe change that should not introduce any regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This indicates that these functions are not used outside of this file, which improves code organization and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.

2. The patch also addresses the warning messages related to missing prototypes for the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free`. By marking these functions as static, the warning messages are eliminated, ensuring cleaner code.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch improves code organization and resolves warning messages, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the beginning of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the function is only executed when the interrupt mode is MSI-X enabled. If the interrupt mode is not MSI-X enabled, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code. This check helps prevent potential issues when the function is called in non-MSI-X modes.

2. The patch also optimizes the ring count validation by skipping the validation if the ring counts are not going to change. This optimization avoids unnecessary validation checks when the ring counts remain the same.

3. In the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function, the patch modifies the condition for validating the RX and TX ring counts. Previously, the condition checked if the `channel->rx_count` and `channel->tx_count` were non-zero. With the patch, the condition now checks if the `adapter->drv_sds_rings` and `adapter->drv_tx_rings` are not equal to the `channel->rx_count` and `channel->tx_count`, respectively. This change ensures that the ring counts are only validated when they are different from the current values stored in the adapter structure.

4. The patch removes the RSS/TSS support check in the `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function. Previously, the function checked if the adapter was in MSI mode or INT-x mode and returned an error if it was not. With the patch, this check is removed, allowing the function to proceed with the ring count validation regardless of the interrupt mode. This change is reasonable as the interrupt mode check is already performed at the beginning of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of ring count validations and removes redundant checks. It also ensures that the function is only executed in the appropriate interrupt mode. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code cleanup that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages in the rtc-nuc900 driver. These messages are deemed unnecessary because they duplicate the generic OOM message from the MM (Memory Management) subsystem.

Given that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered a non-essential change. Therefore, it is more appropriate for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. 

Hence, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch has been signed-off by the author (Florian Fainelli) and the maintainer (David S. Miller), indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code changes in the patch are straightforward and seem to correctly address the issue. The patch replaces the usage of a local copy of the port_vlan_ctl bitmask value with the one maintained by b53_device.

5. The patch is modifying two files: bcm_sf2.c and bcm_sf2.h. The changes in bcm_sf2.c are related to the fix, while the changes in bcm_sf2.h seem to be unrelated and might have been included by mistake. However, since the changes in bcm_sf2.h do not introduce any functional changes or issues, they can be considered harmless.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix SGL Initialization and posting Pages for Dual Chute". It suggests fixing the initialization of SGL (Scatter-Gather List) and related page posting for the chute.

2. The patch includes three signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

3. The code changes start at line 3450 in the `be_main.c` file.

4. The first code change introduces a loop to iterate through the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers. It checks if each ULP is supported by the firmware configuration and breaks the loop when a supported ULP is found.

5. The variable `page_offset` is calculated based on the size of the `iscsi_sge` structure, the number of SGEs per I/O, and the ULP's ICD (Initial Context Descriptor) start value.

6. The next code change starts at line 3946 and modifies the `beiscsi_init_sgl_handle` function. It introduces a loop similar to the previous one to find the supported ULP.

7. The variable `ulp_icd_start` is assigned the ICD start value of the ULP.

8. The loop iterates through the elements of `mem_descr_sg` and sets the `sgl_index` of `psgl_handle` based on the ULP's ICD start value and the `arr_index`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes the initialization of SGL and ensures that the correct ULP's ICD start value is used for setting the `sgl_index`. The changes appear to be necessary for proper functioning of the be2iscsi driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to enhance the jack connection decision logic for the nau8825 codec in the ASoC subsystem.

2. The patch introduces additional conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic.

3. The existing code only handles active low jack insertion logic, so the patch adds support for active high jack insertion logic as well.

4. The patch modifies the function `nau8825_is_jack_inserted()` to read the jack detection control register and determine the polarity of the jack insertion logic.

5. The patch then compares the polarity with the status of the GPIO2JD1 bit to determine the jack connection status.

6. By considering both active high and active low jack insertion logic, the patch ensures compatibility with different hardware configurations.

7. The patch also includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the existing code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix for the mc13892 regulator driver in the Linux kernel. The patch updates the regulator_ops structure for the mc13892_sw_regulator_ops to use the regulator_map_voltage_ascend function instead of the regulator_list_voltage_table function.

The regulator_map_voltage_ascend function is used to map voltage levels in an ascending order, which is suitable for the mc13892_sw1 and mc13892_sw regulators as mentioned in the patch description.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue in the regulator driver, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, it appears that the patch adds a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. The flag is used to only allow runtime PM for devices that explicitly indicate support for it. 

The patch modifies the sdhci_pci_fixes structure by adding a new boolean field called "allow_runtime_pm". This field is set to true for specific sdhci_pci_fixes instances, indicating that runtime PM is allowed for those devices. 

In the sdhci_pci_probe function, the patch checks if the chip's fixes field is not NULL, and if so, it sets the chip's quirks and allow_runtime_pm fields based on the fixes. This ensures that the allow_runtime_pm flag is correctly propagated to the chip.

In the sdhci_pci_probe function, the patch also calls sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow only if the chip's allow_runtime_pm field is true. This function allows runtime PM for the device.

In the sdhci_pci_remove function, the patch calls sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid only if the chip's allow_runtime_pm field is true. This function forbids runtime PM for the device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding support for runtime PM for specific devices in the sdhci-pci driver. As long as the changes are tested and verified to work correctly, it should be safe to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch adds support for handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring (VCS2) in addition to the first BSD ring (VCS1).
4. It checks if the master control interrupt flag for VCS1 or VCS2 is set in the master_ctl variable.
5. If the VCS1 or VCS2 interrupt flag is set, it reads the interrupt status from the corresponding register (GEN8_GT_IIR) and processes the interrupt accordingly.
6. The patch notifies the appropriate ring (VCS or VCS2) if the GT_RENDER_USER_INTERRUPT flag is set in the interrupt status.
7. Finally, it clears the interrupt status by writing back the read value to the register.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug related to handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver, and it has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch and evaluate its impact.

The patch addresses an issue where the return variable of the `request_code_segment()` function is used uninitialized if the `boot_case` argument is false. The patch fixes this by assigning the return value of `write_blk_fifo()` to the `status` variable.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the patch correctly initializes the `status` variable when `boot_case` is false. This ensures that the return value of `write_blk_fifo()` is properly captured and returned by the `request_code_segment()` function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential bug by properly initializing the return variable, improving the reliability and correctness of the code.

2. The patch also updates the "micd-timeout" property to "micd-timeout-ms" in the arizona_extcon_device_get_pdata() function in the extcon-arizona.c driver. This change aligns the property name with the updated documentation.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only improves naming consistency and documentation.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a straightforward and beneficial change that does not introduce any risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time." It suggests delaying the initial jack detection by a specified debounce time.

2. The patch is signed-off by xiangxiao <xiaoxiang@xiaomi.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@linaro.org>.

3. In the code changes, at line 342, the initial jack status update is modified. Instead of immediately detecting the jack status using `snd_soc_jack_gpio_detect(&gpios[i])`, the patch introduces a delayed work scheduling using `schedule_delayed_work(&gpios[i].work, msecs_to_jiffies(gpios[i].debounce_time))`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch introduces a delay in the initial jack detection, allowing the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. This can help improve the reliability and accuracy of jack detection in ASoC (Audio System on Chip) devices.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes the definition of pgprot_writecombine() for MIPS architecture. It addresses an issue where the generic code tries to provide a default implementation by defining pgprot_writecombine as pgprot_noncached, but the MIPS implementation is an inline function rather than a #define. This results in the MIPS implementation not being used.

To resolve this, the patch adds a #define statement for pgprot_writecombine to prevent the generic code from redefining it. This ensures that the MIPS implementation is used correctly.

The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors and has a reference to the patchwork for further review. Therefore, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the MIPS architecture and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch hardcodes the clock event rating for the CMT to 125. This change is made to ensure that all boards use or should use the same clock event rating for the CMT.

2. The clock event device structure is updated to set the rating to 125.

3. The `sh_cmt_register_clockevent` function is modified to remove the `rating` parameter and set the rating directly to 125.

4. The `sh_cmt_register` function is updated to pass a boolean flag `clockevent` instead of `clockevent_rating`. This flag is used to determine whether to register the clock event or not.

5. The `sh_cmt_setup_channel` function is modified to pass the boolean flag `cfg->clockevent_rating != 0` to the `sh_cmt_register` function.

Overall, this patch simplifies the code by removing the need for a separate clock event rating parameter and hardcodes the rating to 125. This change ensures consistency across all boards using the CMT. Therefore, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `snd_array_new` in the file `sound/pci/hda/hda_codec.c`. The purpose of this function is to allocate memory for an array and initialize it.

The patch replaces the explicit `memset` call with a reallocation using `krealloc` with the `GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO` flags. This change ensures that the newly allocated memory is zero-initialized, eliminating the need for the explicit `memset` call.

By using `__GFP_ZERO`, the patch improves code readability and reduces the chances of potential bugs related to uninitialized memory.

Overall, this patch improves the code by simplifying it and making it more efficient. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Impact: The patch seems to have a low impact as it only changes the name of the platform driver. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues.

2. Compatibility: It is important to ensure that the new platform_name is compatible with the existing codebase and does not break any existing functionality. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this change is compatible or not.

3. Testing: It is crucial to test the patch thoroughly to ensure that it does not introduce any regressions or issues. Without information on the testing performed, it is challenging to assess the patch's reliability.

Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, if the patch has been thoroughly tested and deemed compatible with the existing codebase, it could be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would lean towards an ACK for this patch.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch adds a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` after enabling the "CLK_SYS" pin in the `wm8958_mic_detect` function.
2. The patch also adds a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` after disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin in the same function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

1. The added call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` ensures that the DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) framework is synchronized after enabling or disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin. This synchronization is necessary to update the audio power state correctly.
2. Although the comment in the patch suggests that this change will only be useful if the system enables and disables detection at runtime, it is still beneficial to have the DAPM synchronization in place even if detection is set up at system startup. This ensures consistent behavior and avoids potential issues if detection is modified during runtime.

Therefore, considering the added synchronization benefits and the lack of any apparent negative impact, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a sparse warning in the cx25821 driver code. Sparse is a static code analysis tool for the Linux kernel, and fixing warnings from it is generally a good practice.

2. The warning is related to an incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces). This indicates a potential issue with the type of the argument being passed to a function.

3. The patch modifies the code at line 334 in the cx25821-video-upstream.c file. It replaces the memcpy function call with a copy_from_user function call.

4. The change introduces a check using copy_from_user to ensure that the user-provided data is valid and can be safely copied to the kernel buffer. This is a security enhancement to prevent potential buffer overflows or other memory-related issues.

5. If the copy_from_user function returns an error (EFAULT), the function cx25821_write_frame will return -EFAULT, indicating a failure.

6. The patch does not modify any other parts of the code, ensuring that it only addresses the specific issue mentioned in the warning.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the sparse warning and introduces a security enhancement. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding a missing call to `i2c_set_clientdata()` in the `mma8450_probe()` function. This call is necessary to set the client data for the I2C client, which is later used in the `mma8450_remove()` function.

The patch also includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` lines from the authors.

Considering the nature of the patch, which fixes a missing function call, and the fact that it has been reviewed and signed-off by the authors, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq()` in the `ltr501.c` file. The function was originally defined with an `unsigned int` return type, but it can potentially return a negative error code. To improve this implementation detail, the patch suggests changing the return type to `int`.

The change seems reasonable and aligns with the expected behavior of the function. By using a signed return type, it accurately reflects that the function can return negative error codes. This change improves code clarity and avoids potential confusion for developers using this function.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Peter Meerwald-Stadler, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer. This adds credibility to the patch.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || This patch is a renaming change in the staging driver for the Realtek RTL8192E wireless chipset. The function `rtl8192_process_phyinfo` is being renamed to `_rtl92e_process_phyinfo`.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple renaming of two repository routines in the powerpc/ps3 code. The patch replaces the existing names "modify_repository_node_value" and "remove_repository_node" with "write_repository_node" and "delete_repository_node" respectively.

Given that this patch only involves renaming functions and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be considered a non-functional change. Non-functional changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for maintaining consistency or improving code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) not to be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the `nes_reg_user_mr()` function.
2. The `ib_umem_release()` function is responsible for releasing the resources associated with an `ib_umem` object.
3. The patch ensures that if `ib_copy_from_udata()` fails, the `ib_umem_release()` function is called before returning an error.
4. This is consistent with the error-handling code in `nes_reg_user_mr()`, where `ib_umem_release()` is called in case of an error.
5. The patch also adds a call to `ib_umem_release()` before returning an error in the default case of the `switch` statement.
6. This ensures that the `ib_umem` object is properly released in all error scenarios.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential resource leak by adding the necessary calls to `ib_umem_release()`. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is specific to the Blackfin architecture, as indicated by the file path "arch/blackfin/include/asm/dma.h". This means it will only affect systems using the Blackfin architecture, minimizing the risk of unintended consequences on other architectures.

2. The patch removes two lines of code that set the "curr_x_count" and "curr_y_count" registers to zero. These registers are related to the current count of DMA transfers in progress. However, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for removing these lines.

3. The patch adds the "dma_ch[channel].regs->cfg |= DMAEN;" line, which enables the DMA channel by setting the DMAEN flag in the "cfg" register. This change seems to be the main purpose of the patch.

4. The patch also includes an unrelated function "set_dma_callback" that is not modified in this patch. It is unclear why this function is included in the patch, as it does not seem to be related to the changes made.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement for the Blackfin architecture, as it enables the DMA channel. However, it would be helpful to have more information or justification for removing the lines that set the "curr_x_count" and "curr_y_count" registers to zero.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of a PCI ID for the Broxton SOC in the intel_th driver. This patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it adds support for a specific hardware platform.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "usb_put_dev". The usb_put_dev() function already checks if its argument is NULL and returns immediately, so the additional check is redundant. This change simplifies the code and improves readability.

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by both Markus Elfring and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone proper review and testing.

Therefore, it is recommended to include this patch in the Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix for a checkpatch.pl error related to a space before a closing parenthesis. The patch removes the space before the closing parenthesis in the defined macros.

Considering that this patch only addresses a coding style issue and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are fixing a significant issue or improving code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove unnecessary calls to `usb_get_dev` and `usb_put_dev` in the `.probe` and `.disconnect` functions of the `cdc-phonet` USB network driver. 

The rationale behind this patch is that the `usb_device` is the parent device of the `usb_interface` in the driver model, and its reference count is always held during the `.probe` and `.disconnect` operations of the `usb_interface` instance. Therefore, there is no need to explicitly increment and decrement the reference count using `usb_get_dev` and `usb_put_dev`.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The removal of unnecessary function calls can help improve code clarity and potentially reduce overhead in the driver's initialization and cleanup process.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Therefore, my decision is (A) to accept this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the tda998x_irq_thread() function in the tda998x_drv.c file. The purpose of the patch is to report whether the interrupt was actually handled or not, instead of always reporting that it was handled. This change allows for recovery from stuck-IRQ problems, preventing the kernel from locking up.

The patch introduces a new boolean variable called "handled" and initializes it to false. It is used to track whether the interrupt was handled or not. If certain conditions are met, such as finding nothing to do or a HPD change, the "handled" variable is set to true.

The return statement of the function is modified to return IRQ_RETVAL(handled), which returns IRQ_NONE if the interrupt was not handled, and IRQ_HANDLED if it was handled.

Overall, this patch improves the behavior of the tda998x_irq_thread() function by accurately reporting whether the interrupt was handled or not. It also enables recovery from stuck-IRQ problems. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Without further information, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it meets the above criteria.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose: The patch allows X.509 certificates to be blacklisted based on their TBSCertificate hash. This is useful for checking the signature on X.509 certificates and aligns with the approach used by UEFI in its blacklist.

2. Functionality: The patch adds a new field "blacklisted" to the x509_certificate structure and introduces logic to check if a certificate is blacklisted during the signature verification process. If a certificate is blacklisted, an error message is printed, and the "blacklisted" flag is set to true.

3. Code Quality: The patch appears to be well-written and does not introduce any obvious issues or bugs.

4. Impact: The patch enhances the security of the Linux kernel by allowing the blacklisting of specific X.509 certificates. This can be useful in scenarios where certain certificates need to be invalidated due to security concerns.

Considering the purpose, functionality, code quality, and impact of the patch, it seems appropriate to include it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the mac80211 deauth sequence changes. It explains that deleting the AP station directly before setting the device unassociated can cause confusion and unexpected behavior.

2. The proposed fix is to mark the AP station as unused instead of deleting it when mac80211 requests deletion. This allows the unassociated RXON to drop it from the station database in the device.

3. The patch includes changes in the iwl-agn-sta.c, iwl-agn.h, and iwl-mac80211.c files.

4. The code changes in iwl-agn-sta.c introduce a new function called iwl_deactivate_station(). This function deactivates the station by marking it as unused and clears the associated tid_data. It also updates the station count.

5. The code changes in iwl-mac80211.c modify the iwlagn_mac_sta_remove() function. For stations of type NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION, the patch deactivates the station instead of removing it directly. For other station types, the existing behavior of removing the station is maintained.

6. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a reasonable solution. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

6. The patch modifies the arch/mips/include/asm/mips-cm.h file, which is the appropriate location for the changes related to the MIPS architecture.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-documented, reviewed, and relevant to the MIPS architecture. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

2. The change modifies the function `dwc_dump_chan_regs` in the `dw_dmac.c` file. It marks the function as `inline`, which suggests that it is a small and frequently used function that can benefit from being inlined for performance reasons.

3. The change does not introduce any new functionality or alter the existing behavior of the function. It only adds the `inline` keyword to the function declaration.

4. The change is relatively small and isolated, reducing the risk of introducing new bugs or regressions.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial improvement to the `dw_dmac` driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch modifies the function `qla2x00_ga_nxt` in the `qla_gs.c` file of the `qla2xxx` SCSI driver.

2. The patch adds a new line of code that assigns the `fc4_type` of the `fc_port_t` structure based on the value of `fc4_types[2]` in the `ct_rsp->rsp.ga_nxt` structure.

3. If the third bit of `fc4_types[2]` is set (BIT_0), the `fc4_type` is assigned `FC4_TYPE_FCP_SCSI`, otherwise it is assigned `FC4_TYPE_OTHER`.

4. The patch also checks the `port_type` in `ct_rsp->rsp.ga_nxt` and sets the `domain` of `fcport->d_id.b` to `0xf0` if the `port_type` is not `NS_N_PORT_TYPE` or `NS_NL_PORT_TYPE`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds necessary logic to assign the `fc4_type` based on the value of `fc4_types[2]`, which ensures correct handling of the FC-4 type in the `qla2xxx` SCSI driver. Additionally, the patch includes a check for `port_type` and sets the `domain` accordingly, which seems to be a valid and necessary modification.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the file `net/ipv6/ip6_output.c` and replaces the `if (skb_copy_bits(skb, ptr, skb_transport_header(frag), len)) BUG();` statement with `BUG_ON(skb_copy_bits(skb, ptr, skb_transport_header(frag), len));`.

The change replaces the explicit `if` statement with the `BUG_ON` macro, which is a more concise and idiomatic way of expressing the same logic. The `BUG_ON` macro is used to check for conditions that should never occur and triggers a kernel panic if the condition is true.

This change improves code readability and maintainability by using a well-known and widely used macro. It also ensures that any failure in `skb_copy_bits` will result in a kernel panic, making it easier to identify and debug the issue.

Given these reasons, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "[media] firewire: Deletion of an unnecessary check before the function call 'dvb_unregister_device'". It suggests removing an unnecessary check before calling the function "dvb_unregister_device".

The patch author, Markus Elfring, explains that the dvb_unregister_device() function already checks if its argument is NULL and returns immediately. Therefore, the additional check before the function call is redundant.

The patch has been reviewed by Stefan Richter and signed-off by Mauro Carvalho Chehab, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

The code change itself is straightforward. It removes the if statement that checks if fdtv->cadev is not NULL before calling dvb_unregister_device(fdtv->cadev). Instead, it directly calls dvb_unregister_device(fdtv->cadev).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid optimization that removes unnecessary code. It does not introduce any new functionality or risk of regression. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for the TWL6030 devices, which have an interrupt line connected to the application processor. These devices support various features that must wake up the application processor.
2. The patch introduces the `twl6030_irq_set_wake` function, which allows TWL6030 client drivers to use `irq_wake()` for waking up the application processor on their IRQ events.
3. The `twl6030_init_irq` function is modified to set the `irq_set_wake` callback to `twl6030_irq_set_wake`, enabling the wake functionality for TWL6030 interrupts.
4. The `irq_set_chip_data` function is called to set the IRQ number as the chip data for each IRQ, allowing the `twl6030_irq_set_wake` function to retrieve the correct IRQ number.
5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior, but rather adds support for wake functionality for TWL6030 devices.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-implemented and provides a useful feature for TWL6030 devices. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT on the read syscall path. This check is being reverted because it breaks the standard way of reading the counter, which is to open the counter, wait for the monitored process to die, and then read the counter.

2. The patch has been reported by Stephane Eranian and signed-off by Jiri Olsa. It has also been acknowledged by Stephane Eranian and Peter Zijlstra.

3. The patch includes relevant Cc's to individuals who are involved in kernel development and performance monitoring.

4. The patch provides a link to the original discussion on the LKML mailing list.

5. The patch is signed-off by Ingo Molnar, who is a well-known kernel developer.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by relevant individuals and addresses a specific issue with the read syscall path. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `hfi1_query_qp` is being removed from the `qp.c` file in the `staging/rdma/hfi1` directory. The function is no longer being used and is being replaced by the `rvt_query_qp` function defined in `rdmavt`.

The removal of `hfi1_query_qp` seems to be a clean-up change, as it is no longer necessary and can be replaced by an existing function. The patch also includes a `Reviewed-by` tag from Dennis Dalessandro and `Signed-off-by` tags from Harish Chegondi and Doug Ledford.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it is reset.

2. The problem occurs when the kernel reboots, and the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called.

3. In the current code, the buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler, even if the buffer is reset.

4. The patch modifies the code to check if the buffer is empty before updating the buffer tail. If the buffer is empty, the tail is not updated.

5. Additionally, the patch includes a check to wake up the UART write if there are fewer pending characters than a defined threshold (WAKEUP_CHARS).

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer after it is reset, and the modifications seem appropriate to handle this scenario correctly.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem in the ARM i.MX5x platform.

2. It introduces four new clock gates: epit1_ipg_gate, epit1_hf_gate, epit2_ipg_gate, and epit2_hf_gate.

3. The patch registers the new clock gates using the imx_clk_gate2 function.

4. It also registers the new clock gates with clk_register_clkdev, associating them with the imx-epit devices.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding necessary support for EPIT to the clock subsystem in the ARM i.MX5x platform. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a bug in the Bluetooth module's update_scan_rsp_data() function. The function is supposed to operate on the scan_rsp_data_len and scan_rsp_data variables, but it mistakenly operates on the adv_data_len and adv_data variables instead.

The patch corrects this by updating the correct variables: hdev->scan_rsp_data_len and hdev->scan_rsp_data. It also updates the comparison condition to check if hdev->scan_rsp_data_len is equal to len and if the memory contents of cp.data and hdev->scan_rsp_data are the same.

The patch then copies the contents of cp.data to hdev->scan_rsp_data and updates hdev->scan_rsp_data_len with the correct length.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue by correctly updating the scan response data variables and ensures that the correct comparison is made. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the use of `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` in the `bond_debug_register` and `bond_debug_reregister` functions in `bond_debugfs.c`. This change ensures that warning messages are logged using the appropriate network device logging mechanism.

2. The change from `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` is consistent with the existing codebase, as other parts of the bonding driver already use `netdev_warn` for logging warnings related to network devices.

3. The patch includes a comment stating that one occurrence of `pr_warn` is left intact because it is unrelated to `net_device`. This indicates that the patch has been carefully reviewed and only modifies the relevant code.

4. The patch includes proper authorship and sign-off information, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary change to improve the logging mechanism in the bonding driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is constifying the `exynos_drm_crtc_ops` structures in the `exynos5433_drm_decon.c` file. The purpose of this change is to declare these structures as const since they are only passed as an argument to the `exynos_drm_crtc_create` function, which expects a `const struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops *` argument.

The patch modifies the `decon_crtc_ops` structure declaration to be const:

```
-static struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops decon_crtc_ops = {
+static const struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops decon_crtc_ops = {
 	.enable			= decon_enable,
 	.disable		= decon_disable,
 	.enable_vblank		= decon_enable_vblank,
 	...
};
```

This change ensures that the `decon_crtc_ops` structure is treated as read-only and cannot be modified accidentally.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it is a constification, which is generally a safe and non-intrusive modification, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a precedence issue in the original code where the "+" operator has higher precedence than the "?:" operator. This caused the original statement to be equivalent to `entry->mask_pos = PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, which was not the intended behavior.

2. The patch correctly updates the code to handle the intended behavior. It checks if the `control` variable has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set. If it does, it sets `entry->mask_pos` to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`. Otherwise, it sets `entry->mask_pos` to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

3. The patch also includes proper attribution with the "Signed-off-by" tags from the authors who made the changes.

4. The change is a fix for a bug introduced in commit 78b5a310ce, as acknowledged by Bjorn Helgaas in the patch description.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and provides a correct fix for the issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

4. The DRV_MODULE_RELDATE is updated from "August 18, 2011" to "November 2, 2011", indicating a more recent release date.
5. The patch also includes a change in the RESET_KIND_INIT constant, which might be relevant for the driver's functionality.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid update to the tg3 driver, including version increment and updated release date. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code modification that replaces the use of `platform_driver_register()` with `builtin_platform_driver()`. This change aims to simplify the code.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it has been Acked-by Hongzhou Yang, a Mediatek developer, it suggests that the patch has undergone review and testing within the Mediatek community.

Given these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that further review and testing by the Linux kernel maintainers is still necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the code in the drm/msm driver, specifically in the msm_atomic_commit() function.

2. The patch introduces the use of drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() function to set the fence for the plane_state. This function is designed not to overwrite plane_state->fence if the user has already set an explicit fence.

3. The patch includes the necessary Cc, Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

4. The patch also includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website, providing additional context and discussion about the patch.

5. The code changes in the patch appear to be correct and do not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to be a valid improvement to the drm/msm driver, and it has received the necessary review and approval. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to replace the usage of the `should_stop` variable with the `kthread_should_stop()` API in the `virthba.c` file of the Unisys driver in the Linux kernel. 

The `kthread_should_stop()` API is used to check if a kernel thread should stop execution. It is a recommended practice to use this API instead of directly accessing the `should_stop` variable.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it improves code readability and follows the recommended usage of the `kthread_should_stop()` API.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT (Device Tree) data for OMAP2+ devices. This is done to avoid the need to add most of the clock aliases under drivers/clk/ti/clk-xyz.c files.

2. The patch modifies the _add_clkdev() function in omap_device.c.

3. The patch first attempts to get the clock using clk_get_sys() with the provided clk_name. If it fails and the DT has been populated, it proceeds with the DT-based approach.

4. In the DT-based approach, it searches for the node with the given clk_name and retrieves the clock using of_clk_get_from_provider().

5. If the clock retrieval is successful, it registers the clock with clk_register_clkdev() using the provided clk_alias and the device name.

6. If the clock retrieval fails or the DT has not been populated, it falls back to the original approach of using clk_add_alias().

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch improves the creation of clock aliases for OMAP2+ devices by utilizing DT data, which reduces the need for manual additions in the clk-xyz.c files. This approach is more flexible and aligns with the use of DT in the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes the return value of the efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivarfs file system driver. Currently, the function returns a ssize_t type, which is a signed integer, but the variable "bytes" is of type size_t, which is an unsigned integer. This can potentially introduce sign issues.

To fix this, the patch initializes "bytes" as a ssize_t type and assigns it the value of "count" before any error checks or modifications. This ensures that the return value is consistent and avoids any sign issues.

The patch also updates the error handling code to assign the appropriate error values to "bytes" instead of modifying "count". This ensures that the return value accurately reflects the error condition encountered during the execution of the function.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential sign issue and improves the consistency and accuracy of the return value. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for issues related to newer versions of gcc when dealing with variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch replaces array indexing with pointer arithmetic to address the problem.

Considering that the patch addresses specific bugs reported on the freedesktop.org bug tracker, it seems to be a targeted fix for a known issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially cause regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" member outside the "mesh_stats" debug group. This change is made because "estab_plinks" is not a statistics member and should not be displayed with other mesh stat members.

2. The patch adds the "estab_plinks" debugfs attribute to the "add_mesh_files" function. This allows the "estab_plinks" attribute to be displayed in the debugfs file system.

3. The patch removes the "estab_plinks" member from the "add_mesh_stats" function. This is consistent with the change made in the first step, where "estab_plinks" is no longer considered a mesh stat member.

Overall, the patch seems to be making necessary changes to correctly handle the "estab_plinks" member in the mesh networking code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a sparse warning: The patch declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to address the "symbol was not declared" warning generated by the sparse tool. This indicates that the patch resolves a potential issue in the code.

2. The patch is signed-off by the author and maintainer: The patch has been signed-off by both Merlin Chlosta and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The patch modifies the `ieee80211_softmac.c` file: The changes are specific to the `ieee80211_softmac.c` file in the `drivers/staging/rtl8192u/ieee80211` directory. This suggests that the patch is targeted at a specific area of the codebase.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a sparse warning and has been reviewed by the relevant parties. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, it appears to be adding locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

Considering the purpose of the patch is to add locking for the vbuf pool, it is likely addressing a concurrency issue related to accessing and modifying the `free_vbufs` list. The addition of the spinlock ensures that concurrent operations on the list are properly synchronized, preventing potential race conditions.

Given the nature of the patch and its potential to improve the stability and reliability of the virtio-gpu driver, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix memory leaks in the __il4965_up() function of the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses two specific scenarios where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed.

The suggested changes include deallocating broadcast stations in both error paths, where the card isn't ready after il4965_prepare_card_hw() and when the card is hardware-rfkilled. This prevents memory leaks in these scenarios.

The patch modifies the `xt_hashlimit.c` file in the `net/netfilter` directory. It introduces a new function called `rateinfo_init`, which initializes the `rateinfo` structure for a given `dsthash_ent` object.

The `rateinfo_init` function sets the `prev` field of the `rateinfo` structure to the current value of `jiffies`. It also calculates the initial credit and cost values based on the `avg` and `burst` configuration parameters from the `hinfo` object. Finally, it sets the `credit_cap` field to the same value as `credit`.

The patch then replaces the previous initialization of the `rateinfo` structure in the `hashlimit_mt` function with a call to the newly introduced `rateinfo_init` function.

Overall, this patch improves code modularity by moving the initialization of the `rateinfo` structure to a separate helper function. This change makes the code easier to read and maintain.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug where errors in add_probe_trace_event() are not passed to debuginfo__find_trace_events(). This can cause a segmentation fault if perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob. The patch ensures that tf->ntevs and tf->tevs are not modified if add_probe_trace_event() fails.

The patch includes changes to the add_probe_trace_event() function. It adds error handling code that clears the probe_trace_event and decrements tf->ntevs if add_probe_trace_event() fails. This prevents the segfault and ensures that the failed event is not added.

The patch also includes proper memory allocation checks and error handling for strdup() and zalloc() calls.

The patch has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo. It also has Cc tags from other relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and includes proper error handling. It has been tested and has the necessary tags. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function of `checkpoint.c`. This ensures that the `s_dirty` flag is checked and the checkpoint is skipped if it is not set. This change is necessary because `s_dirty` is reset under `cp_mutex`.

2. The previous condition for skipping the checkpoint was incorrect. The patch fixes this by introducing the correct condition, which omits doing the checkpoint when a checkpoint was already done and all the node pages were written back.

3. The `write_checkpoint` function is responsible for performing the necessary block operations and then calling `do_checkpoint` to write the checkpoint. After that, it unblocks the operations and increments the checkpoint count. The `out` label is used to skip the checkpoint if `s_dirty` is not set.

4. In `super.c`, the patch removes the previous condition for skipping the `f2fs_sync_fs` function if `s_dirty` is not set. This is because the check for `s_dirty` is now done in `write_checkpoint` itself.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness of the checkpointing process by correctly checking `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` and skipping the checkpoint when it is not necessary. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition with hardware when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The patch introduces a check after updating the hardware to ensure that the alarm time has not been surpassed. If it has, the alarm is rescheduled.

true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

The patch removes a redundant check in the mwifiex_set_encode() function in the mwifiex driver. The check is related to the interface type being AP (Access Point). If the interface type is AP, the function currently returns 0, which means the function exits without deleting the WEP keys. The patch removes this check, allowing the WEP keys to be deleted even if the interface type is AP.

The patch claims to fix an issue where if an AP is started with WEP security and then restarted with WPA/WPA2 security, a connected station is able to connect but ping fails. By removing the redundant check, the patch ensures that the WEP keys are deleted, which should resolve the issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It removes a redundant check and fixes a specific issue related to AP and WEP/WPA security transitions.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a kernel oops caused by a NULL i2c_adapter parent pointer in the cx24123 driver. The patch adds the missing parent pointer assignment, which should resolve the issue.

2. Mitigation of the current issue: The patch effectively ratelimits the generation of warning messages by checking if the work is scheduled successfully. If the work is not scheduled, it checks if the ratelimit threshold has been reached before generating the warning message.

3. Limitation of the patch: The patch does not address the underlying problem in usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism, where events can get dropped and not handled. However, it acknowledges this limitation in the patch description.

4. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Steve Glendinning and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the patch's purpose, the mitigation it provides, and the sign-offs, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the issue of excessive warning messages generated by usbnet.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific problem: The current driver sets the request's DMA address as 0 to mark it as invalid, but some gadget drivers set it to DMA_ADDR_INVALID. This inconsistency leads to incorrect data transmission.

2. The patch fixes the problem by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid. This ensures consistency and prevents bogus data transmission.

3. The patch has been tested and verified by Pavankumar Kondeti <pkondeti@codeaurora.org>.

4. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Michael Grzeschik <m.grzeschik@pengutronix.de>, Marc Kleine-Budde <mkl@pengutronix.de>, Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>, and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>.

5. The changes in the patch are localized to the ci13xxx_udc.c file, specifically in the _hardware_enqueue, _hardware_dequeue, and ep_alloc_request functions.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to reduce the memory footprint for debugging in the DRM Radeon driver.

2. The patch removes the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() function and replaces it with a kernel helper function, printk(), which can dump up to 64 bytes.

3. The size of the data being dumped in this case is 15 bytes, so using printk() is sufficient.

4. The patch updates the debug message format from using hex_dump_to_buffer() to using the %*ph format specifier in printk(). This format specifier allows printing a buffer of a specified length in hexadecimal format.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the code. It only improves the memory usage and simplifies the code.

6. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes unused return smatch warnings in the tcmu_netlink_event function in drivers/target/target_core_user.c.

2. The patch initializes the "ret" variable to -ENOMEM, which is the error code for out-of-memory conditions.

3. The patch checks if genlmsg_new fails to allocate a new sk_buff and returns the initialized "ret" value (-ENOMEM) instead of -ENOMEM directly.

4. The patch checks if genlmsg_put fails to allocate space for the message header and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

5. The patch uses nla_put_string and nla_put_u32 to add attributes to the skb. It checks if these functions fail and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

6. The patch checks if genlmsg_end fails to finalize the message and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

7. If all the operations are successful, the patch calls genlmsg_multicast to send the skb and returns the "ret" value (0) if it succeeds.

8. The patch adds a "free_skb" label to handle the cleanup of the sk_buff in case of failures. It frees the sk_buff using nlmsg_free and returns the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

Overall, the patch addresses the unused return smatch warnings and handles error conditions properly. It improves the code's correctness and maintainability. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a minor cleanup for the FRAC_BITS value in the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. The patch fixes the issue of hardcoding the value and instead uses the FRAC_BITS macro.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the S25FL127S nor flash part. It mentions that each writing to the configuration register takes a significant amount of time, during which no more accesses to the flash should be done.

2. The patch adds a wait loop after the register writing until the flash finishes its work. This ensures that no further accesses to the flash are made during this time.

3. The issue described in the patch could lead to rootfs mounting failure if the quad enable bit setting step is done too closely to the mounting process. This can potentially cause filesystem corruption.

4. The patch includes error handling in case there is a timeout while writing the configuration register. It logs an error message and returns an appropriate error code.

5. The patch also performs a read-back and check of the configuration register to ensure that the quad enable bit is properly set.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue, provides necessary error handling, and ensures proper functioning of the flash part. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue Description: The patch addresses a reported issue where a sigbus error occurs when running a specific fio job file with a device dax alignment of 4KB or 2MB. The error is observed in the huge fault code.

2. Patch Solution: The patch introduces a fix to handle fallback when a fault is larger than the device alignment or when a larger fault is encountered while a smaller mapping is already established. The patch ensures that fallback occurs until the fault size matches the alignment.

3. Patch Justification: The patch provides a simple and immediate fix for the reported issue. While supporting larger mappings for a device with a smaller alignment could be considered, it is deemed too large of a change for the immediate fix.

4. Patch Details: The patch modifies the __dax_dev_pud_fault function in the dax.c driver file. It adds a fault_size variable to store the size of the fault (PUD_SIZE). It then checks if the fault size is less than the device's alignment, in which case it returns VM_FAULT_SIGBUS. If the fault size is greater than the alignment, it returns VM_FAULT_FALLBACK. Additionally, it checks if the fault is outside the VMA range and returns VM_FAULT_SIGBUS in that case as well.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address the reported issue and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the badness score underflow in the out-of-memory (OOM) killer.
2. The issue occurs when the privileges given to root threads or a negative value of /proc/pid/oom_score_adj exceed the amount of resident set size (rss) of a thread.
3. The patch fixes this issue by making the type of the 'points' variable signed and returning 1 if the value is negative, indicating that the thread is still eligible for kill.
4. The patch includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, acknowledged, and signed-off on the fix.
5. The changes in the patch are localized to the mm/oom_kill.c file, specifically in the oom_badness() function.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue where the struct rtl_tcb_desc object is not properly initialized in the rtl8192cu driver. The patch adds a memset call to clear the struct before using it.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a valid fix for an uninitialized struct issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "kconfig: delete last traces of __enabled_ from autoconf.h". It suggests removing the generation of "__enabled_" prefixed macros in the autoconf.h file. These macros were previously used by IS_ENABLED() and related macros.

The patch removes the generation of "__enabled_CONFIG_*" and "__enabled_CONFIG_*_MODULE" macros. These macros were used by IS_ENABLED(), IS_BUILTIN(), and IS_MODULE() macros to check the configuration status of a symbol.

Since the patch states that IS_ENABLED() and its related macros have been fixed to not require "__enabled_" prefixed versions, it is safe to remove these macros from autoconf.h.

Therefore, the patch seems to be a cleanup and removal of unnecessary code. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. Hence, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch. A more comprehensive analysis would involve considering the context, testing, and potential impacts on other parts of the kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a use-after-free issue in the TIOCMIWAIT function of the quatech2 USB serial driver. This is a critical bug that needs to be addressed.

2. The patch introduces a check for the serial disconnected flag before accessing private port data after waking up. This ensures that the private port data, including the wait queue, is still valid after a disconnect.

3. The patch removes the declaration and initialization of the delta_msr_wait wait queue from the qt2_port_private structure. This is because the wait queue is now accessed through the port structure.

4. The wait_event_interruptible function is modified to use the port->delta_msr_wait wait queue instead of the priv->delta_msr_wait wait queue.

5. The patch adds a check for the serial disconnected flag before returning from the wait_modem_info function. If the serial is disconnected, it returns -EIO.

6. The qt2_update_msr function is modified to wake up the port->delta_msr_wait wait queue instead of the priv->delta_msr_wait wait queue.

Overall, the patch addresses a critical bug and makes necessary changes to ensure the stability and correctness of the quatech2 USB serial driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to an overflow condition in the pool_find_page() function of dmapool.c. When a DMA pool lies at the very top of the dma_addr_t range, the calculated end address of the pool wraps around to zero, causing page lookup to always fail.

2. The patch modifies the calculation in the if statement to be overflow-proof. Instead of comparing dma < (page->dma + pool->allocation), it compares (dma - page->dma) < pool->allocation. This ensures that the calculation does not result in an overflow and correctly checks if the DMA address falls within the allocated range.

3. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by tags from the author and relevant individuals who have reviewed the patch.

4. The patch is relatively small and focused, addressing a specific issue without introducing any new functionality or potential regressions.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the overflow condition in the dmapool module.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: Divide by zero error
   - The patch addresses a divide by zero error that occurs when pushing data during tcp-repair mode.
   - The error is triggered when tcp_push is called with mss_now being 0.
   - This error leads to a crash, as shown in the provided kernel log.

2. Reproduction steps:
   - The patch includes a packetdrill script that reproduces the issue.
   - It sets up a scenario where the kernel crashes due to the divide by zero error.

3. Patch explanation:
   - The patch adds a new goto-label called out_nopush.
   - When exiting tcp_sendmsg and a push is not required (which is the case for tp->repair), the code jumps to this label.
   - In repair mode with TCP_RECV_QUEUE set, the data is put in the receive-queue, so no push is required because no data has been added to the send-queue.
   - By going to out_nopush, the push operation is skipped, preventing the divide by zero error.

4. Fixes:
   - The patch is marked as fixing the issue introduced by commit ec3423257508 (tcp: fix retransmission in repair mode).
   - The commit mentioned above caused the call to tcp_push to be prevented by a check for tp->repair.
   - The patch resolves this issue by adding the necessary logic to handle the repair mode correctly.

5. Acknowledgments:
   - The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Andrew Vagin and Pavel Emelyanov.
   - Their acknowledgment adds credibility to the patch and suggests that it has been thoroughly reviewed.

Based on the analysis above, it is recommended to accept this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The bug occurs because the code is executed before the caches are probed, resulting in incorrect evaluation of the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro.
3. By running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(), the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro will evaluate correctly, and the unsupported highmem case will be detected successfully.
4. The patch also resolves an additional issue where mem_init_free_highmem() attempts to free all highmem pages, even though they are not used and do not have valid page structures. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception.
5. To avoid this issue, the patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates to true.
6. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and relevant individuals involved in the patch.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and improves the detection of unsupported highmem with cache aliases. It also resolves an additional issue related to freeing highmem pages. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the duration calculation for non-aggregated packets in the ath9k driver.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It states that before the tx path rework, the ath_tx_fill_desc function was called with the length of the packet or aggregate as a parameter. However, after the rework, ath_tx_sched_aggr can pass a burst of single frames with len=0. This patch fixes the broken duration calculation by overriding the length in ath_tx_fill_desc before passing it to ath_buf_set_rate.

3. The patch includes a "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" line, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

4. The patch has been reported by Simon Wunderlich and signed-off by Felix Fietkau and John W. Linville, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a specific issue and has undergone appropriate review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the patch and its impact.

The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit 2ae66c26550cd94b0e2606a9275eb0ab7070ad0e, which caused a buffer-alignment issue on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI. The issue arises because the driver modifies the global variable align_buffer_size when an Intel controller is found, which affects the Nvidia HDMI controller that is probed after Intel.

The patch fixes the problem by moving the align_buffer_size flag into the local struct, ensuring it is not affected by other controllers.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a regression and resolves a specific issue with buffer alignment on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI. Additionally, it has been tested and reported in Bugzilla, indicating that it has undergone some level of verification.

However, it is important to note that further testing and review may be necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any new issues or conflicts with other parts of the kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a comparison issue in the `exact_match` function in `lib/dma-debug.c`. The comparison `(a->dev_addr == a->dev_addr)` is incorrect as it compares the same pointer variable `a->dev_addr` with itself, which is redundant and always evaluates to true.

The correct comparison should be `(a->dev_addr == b->dev_addr)` to compare the `dev_addr` field of both `a` and `b` structures.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a comparison issue and improves the correctness of the code.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to error handling during the initialization of the ehv_bytechan tty driver.

2. The patch introduces a cleanup in the error handling code to avoid deregistering a never-registered tty driver, which could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference.

3. The patch modifies the error handling flow by using appropriate error labels and goto statements.

4. The patch ensures that if the allocation of the tty driver fails, it directly jumps to the "err_free_bcs" label to free the allocated resources before returning the error code.

5. If the registration of the tty driver fails, the patch jumps to the "err_put_tty_driver" label to unregister the driver and release the allocated resources before returning the error code.

6. If the registration of the platform driver fails, the patch jumps to the "err_deregister_tty_driver" label to unregister the tty driver and release the allocated resources before returning the error code.

7. The patch properly handles the cleanup of resources by unregistering the tty driver and releasing the allocated memory in case of errors.

Overall, the patch improves the error handling in the initialization of the ehv_bytechan tty driver, ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up in case of failures. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using the GFP flags from the caller instead of using GFP_ATOMIC in the netlbl_secattr_catmap_setbit() function.

2. The reason for this change is that there is no need to prefer GFP_ATOMIC over the caller's GFP flags since there is no lock taken in this function.

3. The only caller of this function, cipso_v4_map_cat_rng_ntoh(), already passes GFP_ATOMIC as the GFP flags. Therefore, this change does not affect how the code works.

4. The patch is considered a cleanup, as it removes unnecessary code and simplifies the function.

Based on these points, the patch does not introduce any functional changes and improves code readability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a blacklist for interface 1 on the Huawei E173s-6 device. This is necessary because interface 1 causes an oops on usb_wwan with log flooding when accessed by the option driver.

2. The patch also mentions that interface 1 does not respond to QMI, indicating that it is likely used by the card reader and should not be added to qmi_wwan.

3. The patch includes the necessary USB device and interface information for the Huawei E173s-6 device, allowing the option driver to blacklist it.

4. The patch is signed-off by Gustavo Zacarias and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the reasons mentioned above, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent the oops and log flooding issues caused by interface 1 on the Huawei E173s-6 device.
true || Based on the provided patch description, it appears that this patch addresses a bug related to coredump handling for hugepages in the hugetlbfs filesystem. The bug causes a VM_BUG_ON error when a memory error occurs on a hugepage and the affected processes try to access it.

The patch aims to fix this bug by adding a swap entry check in the follow_hugetlb_page() function. It introduces a new behavior for different scenarios, such as absent hugepages, swap entries, and dump requests. The expected behavior is described in the patch description.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the patch has already received Acked-by tags from several developers, indicating their approval of the patch.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a possible hang due to a race condition on thread termination in the dm-crypt module.
2. The race condition occurs when a kernel thread executes __set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE), __add_wait_queue, spin_unlock_irq, and then tests kthread_should_stop(). If memory accesses are reordered, kthread_should_stop() may be executed before __set_current_state(), leading to a race condition.
3. The proposed fix introduces a new flag, DM_CRYPT_EXIT_THREAD, to signal the kernel thread to exit. The flag is set and tested while holding cc->write_thread_wait.lock, ensuring no racy access to the flag.
4. The unnecessary set_task_state(current, TASK_RUNNING) following the schedule() call is removed. The process's state is already set to TASK_RUNNING when it is woken up, and other kernel code does not set the state to TASK_RUNNING following schedule().
5. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag, Signed-off-by, and Cc information.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential race condition and provides a clear and concise solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the draining of aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver after a transmission attempt.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution: It mentions that after a transmission attempt, an A-MPDU subframe can still have fi->retries at 0 if the retry count wasn't incremented due to powersave. In such cases, the subframe is still tracked as part of the block ack window, so the patch clears its sequence number from the pending frame bitmap during tid queue draining.

3. The patch is signed-off by two individuals: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org> and John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code changes in the patch appear to be correct and relevant to the issue being addressed. The line "ath_tx_update_baw(sc, tid, bf->bf_state.seqno);" is moved outside the conditional statement, ensuring that the block ack window is updated regardless of the retry count.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch adds a sanity check for the file name length in the hfs_mac2asc function in the fs/hfs/trans.c file. It checks if the length of the source name (srclen) is greater than the maximum allowed length (HFS_NAMELEN) and if so, sets srclen to the maximum allowed length.

This check prevents a potential buffer overflow that could occur on a corrupted file system where the ->len field is incorrect. By limiting the length of the source name to the maximum allowed length, the patch ensures that the destination buffer (out) is not overflowed.

The patch has been reported and acknowledged by Clement LECIGNE and signed-off by Dan Carpenter. It is also CC'd to the stable@kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Additionally, the patch has been signed-off by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, further validating its acceptance.

The patch suggests that distributions can manually enable the link protections if needed, and there is a possibility of introducing a kernel config option in the future to automatically enable such behavioral options.

Given the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. The decision is based on the fact that the change is being reverted to maintain compatibility with legacy behavior and to avoid breaking existing systems.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a possible race condition in mlx5_core_destroy_mkey() function. It ensures that the mr is first removed from the radix tree and then destroyed, preventing any race condition if the key was reallocated.

2. The patch also handles radix tree insert/delete failures. If the radix tree insert fails, it logs a warning message, destroys the mr, and returns the error.

3. In mlx5_core_destroy_mkey(), the patch adds a check to verify if the mr was successfully deleted from the radix tree. If the deletion fails, it logs a warning message, returns -ENOENT (indicating the entry was not found), and does not proceed with destroying the mkey.

4. The patch removes the redundant radix_tree_delete() call after mlx5_cmd_exec(). This call was already performed earlier, and removing it avoids unnecessary operations.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential race condition and handles errors properly. It improves the reliability and stability of the mlx5_core module. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch modifies the `cfg_queues` function in the `cxgb4_main.c` file.

3. The change is made in the following line:
   ```
   i = min_t(int, MAX_OFLD_QSETS, num_online_cpus());
   ```
   The `min_t` macro ensures that the value of `i` is not greater than `MAX_OFLD_QSETS` or the number of online CPUs, whichever is smaller.

4. By capping the number of offload queue sets, the patch prevents the driver from crashing on machines with more cores than the maximum allowed offload queue sets.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Ganesh Goudar and David S. Miller, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an out-of-bounds access issue in the f_fs driver of the USB gadget subsystem. The issue occurs when accessing the companion descriptor for SuperSpeed endpoints, which is not allocated for HighSpeed or FullSpeed endpoints. This leads to a kernel bug and a bad access detection.

The patch addresses this issue by checking if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. If the gadget is not SuperSpeed, the companion descriptor is not accessed.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a bug and preventing out-of-bounds access, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that there was a mistake in the check of the return value from __find_format() function, which was inverted by mistake.
2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the condition `if (!format)` has been changed to `if (format)`.
3. The original code logic was correct, where if `format` is not found, it should return `-EINVAL`. However, the patch changes this behavior, which is incorrect.
4. The patch introduces a regression by incorrectly modifying the code logic, which can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect error handling.
5. Therefore, accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases could introduce issues and break the expected behavior of the code.

Hence, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes a useless BUG_ON statement that caused a regression in the 3.5 kernel version.
2. The regression was introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16, which removed the list of pinned inactive objects.
3. The crash occurs in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl() function, specifically at line 3661, where the BUG_ON(!list_empty(&dev_priv->mm.inactive_list)) check is made.
4. According to Chris, the BUG_ON check is unnecessary and can be safely removed. The checks are a crude approximation and are too late to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state.
5. Removing the BUG_ON statement will not introduce any new issues and will fix the regression caused by the previous commit.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to resolve the regression issue.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a recursive locking bug introduced in the imx_console_write() function.
   - The bug occurs when the function is called recursively, leading to a deadlock situation.
   - The issue is not easily detectable due to the lack of printks on the serial console.

2. Solution: The patch proposes a solution to avoid locking in the sysrq case and use trylock in the oops_in_progress case.
   - This approach is already used in other drivers and helps prevent similar bugs caused by copy/paste/modify errors.

3. Additional Issue: There is another issue related to the scheme used in the patch.
   - When port->sysrq is not reset, all console writes happen unlocked, leaving the current writer unprotected against certain operations.
   - The patch suggests introducing a separate indicator (port->sysrq_cpu) to address this issue.

4. Scope: The proposed solution goes beyond the scope of this fix and should be implemented in a common function to avoid future bugs.
   - This indicates that the patch is part of a larger effort to improve the locking mechanism in drivers using this scheme.

5. Testing and Reporting: The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander <tim@krieglstein.org>.
   - This adds credibility to the patch and suggests that it has undergone some level of testing.

Considering the above analysis, it seems reasonable to accept this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it is always recommended to review the patch thoroughly and conduct further testing before finalizing the decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a race condition in the netfilter nf_ct_h323 module. The current implementation of mod_timer in the code introduces a race condition where the timer can be reactivated even after it has expired and the memory associated with it has been freed.

The proposed fix suggests replacing mod_timer with mod_timer_pending to prevent the reactivation of the timer after it has expired and the associated memory has been freed.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). This fix addresses a potential race condition that could lead to accessing freed memory, improving the stability and reliability of the netfilter nf_ct_h323 module.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a memory leak issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver.
2. The current implementation reallocates all resources during resume but fails to release them during suspend.
3. The patch changes the logic to avoid unnecessary reallocation and release of resources.
4. Instead, it reinitializes the descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume.
5. The patch has been tested on STi boxes.
6. It includes the reported-by and signed-off-by tags, indicating that the issue was reported and the patch was reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.
7. The patch modifies the stmmac_main.c file, which is the appropriate location for the fix.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the memory leak issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for passing beacons from foreign APs in AP mode. This is necessary to properly set the ht protection IE. This indicates a functional improvement.

2. The patch also adds the same filters for passing probe requests and beacons from other APs in GO mode. This is likely a fix for a mistake where GO mode didn't have any configured filter_flags. This indicates a bug fix.

3. The changes are made in the "iwl_mvm_mac_ctxt_cmd_ap" and "iwl_mvm_mac_ctxt_cmd_go" functions in the "mac-ctxt.c" file of the iwlwifi driver.

4. The patch is signed-off by Eliad Peller and Emmanuel Grumbach, who are both from Intel. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developers.

Overall, the patch appears to provide functional improvement and bug fix, and it has been reviewed and signed-off by the appropriate developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) probes in the TCP protocol.
2. The patch fixes a bug where F-RTO may incorrectly send more probes if the next ACK advances SND_UNA and does not sack new packets.
3. The bug can cause the sender to always send new data instead of repairing holes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver for the application.
4. The patch modifies the code to correctly handle the conditions for sending F-RTO probes, ensuring that they are sent only once as specified in the F-RTO RFC 5682.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and maintainers.

Considering the clear problem description and the appropriate fix provided by the patch, it seems suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit (fcc60b413d14dd06ddbd79ec50e83c4fb2a097ba) that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged.

2. The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require calling prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical.

3. The original commit mentioned that preventing waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates, but the patch suggests that there are better ways to fix this issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It allows the driver to decide when prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions are necessary, rather than handling all the special cases in the core.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Given this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The race condition issue is a significant concern, and reverting the commit is a reasonable solution until a proper way to support kexec within the DRM is identified and implemented.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

2. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

3. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to use the synack_stamp instead of tp->lsndtime to compute the SYNACK RTT.

4. Additionally, if the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the (Fast Open'd) data packets sent in SYN_RECV, the SYNACK RTT is the smooth RTT computed in tcp_ack().

5. The patch also initializes the synack_stamp variable in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function based on whether a request_sock exists or not.

6. Finally, the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function is called with the updated synack_stamp value.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and improves the accuracy of the RTT measurement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a reject for the MPC5121 platform if an input-only pin is requested to be set as an output. This is done to comply with the reference manual (18.3.1.1). This change ensures that input-only pins cannot be mistakenly set as output pins.

2. The patch also rewrites the mach-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which improves scalability.

3. The patch adds a new function, `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out`, which checks if the requested GPIO pin is within the range of 28 to 31 (inclusive) and returns an error if it is. Otherwise, it calls the existing `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function.

4. The patch modifies the `gc->direction_output` assignment in the `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function. It now checks if the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc5121-gpio" and assigns `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` as the direction output function. Otherwise, it assigns `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out`. This change ensures that the correct direction output function is used based on the device compatibility.

5. The patch also modifies the `gc->get` assignment in the `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function. It now checks if the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc8572-gpio" and assigns `mpc8572_gpio_get` as the get function. Otherwise, it assigns `mpc8xxx_gpio_get`. This change ensures that the correct get function is used based on the device compatibility.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch is a bug fix and improves the compatibility and functionality of the MPC5121 platform. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm in the Nouveau DRM driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a specific resource, and it helps avoid the need for additional checks for the mm's existence throughout the codebase.

2. The patch modifies the `nouveau_mm_init` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/core/mm.c`. It introduces a conditional check for the length parameter. If the length is non-zero, the offset and length calculations are performed; otherwise, the node is created without any offset or length values.

3. The patch also removes the `heap_size` variable from the `struct nouveau_mm` in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/include/core/mm.h`. This variable is no longer needed since the length calculation is now conditional.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable enhancement that improves code readability and avoids unnecessary checks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to re-queuing packets in the IB/IPoIB driver when the destination address is not resolved yet via path query.
2. The patch adds a new function called "push_pseudo_header" that is responsible for pushing a pseudo header containing the destination address into the skb (socket buffer).
3. The "push_pseudo_header" function is called in several places where the skb is re-queued, ensuring that the correct destination address is present in the skb.
4. The patch also includes a fix for a queue length limit issue and updates the comments for clarity.
5. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors and has been tested.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and has been reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a deadlock issue that can occur when using NVMe-oF with a small queue size (<32). The issue is caused by IB completions not being sent until the queue reaches 32, which can lead to the send queue getting filled up.

2. Solution: The patch changes the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth instead of a fixed value. It removes a magic define and introduces a new function, `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit()`, to calculate the signaling limit based on the queue size. This ensures that completions are signaled appropriately, even for devices with a queue depth of 1.

3. Impact: The patch modifies the `nvme_rdma_post_send()` function to use the new signaling mechanism. It checks if the signaling limit has been reached or if a flush is requested, and sets the appropriate send flags to signal completions. This change ensures that completions are signaled correctly, preventing the deadlock issue.

4. Acknowledgments: The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Sagi Grimberg, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted developer.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a solution that is well-reasoned and reviewed. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not transitioning from idle to active state when HDMI is enabled. This issue can cause HDMI not to work correctly when it's the default display.

2. The patch provides a temporary fix by ensuring that the DSS clock domain is enabled before calling pm_runtime_get_sync() for the HDMI platform device. This fix allows HDMI's PHY to function correctly.

3. The patch includes a comment stating that the added dss_runtime_get() call is a hack and should be removed later. This indicates that the patch is not a final solution but a temporary workaround.

4. The patch is signed-off by two developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the HDMI issue. However, it is important to note that a more comprehensive fix should be implemented in the future, as mentioned in the patch description.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch includes a reference to a reported and tested-by case, indicating that the issue has been verified.
4. It also includes signed-off-by statements from multiple contributors, including Eric Sandeen, Tao Ma, and Theodore Ts'o.
5. The patch modifies the ext4_end_io_buffer_write function in inode.c and the io_submit_add_bh function in page-io.c to correctly handle the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag and increment the i_aiodio_unwritten counter when necessary.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and has been tested and reviewed by multiple contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to prevent a lockdep warning in the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function in the IB/ipoib driver. The lockdep warning indicates a possible recursive locking scenario, which can lead to a deadlock.

The patch suggests using the down_read_nested function instead of down_read to prevent the warning. The down_read_nested function allows for nested locking, which is necessary in this case since __ipoib_ib_dev_flush calls itself recursively on child devices.

Considering the potential deadlock and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue and improves the stability of the IB/ipoib driver.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

5. Stability: The patch addresses a stability issue by preventing a NULL pointer dereference, making it suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of interrupts in the iwlwifi driver. The bug causes the "trans_pcie->inta" variable to be reset after the spinlock is released, potentially leading to missed interrupts.

The patch addresses this issue by moving the reset of "trans_pcie->inta" before releasing the spinlock. This ensures that interrupts are not missed due to the reset happening after other interrupt reasons were added to the variable.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that could lead to missed interrupts and improves the reliability of the iwlwifi driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with uninitialized memory access when writing to oprofilefs. It fixes the users of oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() by checking the return value of the function. If the return value is less than or equal to 0, it returns the value, indicating an error.

The patch also includes a reference to a previous commit that missed these changes for s390 architecture.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward fix for a potential issue, and it has been reviewed and signed-off by the author. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the sctp_diag.c file in the net/sctp directory. The changes are as follows:

1. In the sctp_ep_dump() function, the condition for checking the idiag_states flag is modified. Previously, it checked if the idiag_states flag had any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN, but now it checks if the idiag_states flag has neither TCPF_LISTEN nor TCPF_CLOSE bits set. This change ensures that the sctp_diag module does not rely solely on the TCPF_LISTEN flag to determine if a socket is a listening socket.

2. In the sctp_diag_dump() function, the condition for checking the idiag_states flag is also modified. Previously, it checked if the idiag_states flag had no bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN, but now it checks if the idiag_states flag has neither TCPF_LISTEN nor TCPF_CLOSE bits set. This change ensures that the sctp_diag module does not skip dumping endpoint information when the idiag_states flag has the TCPF_CLOSE bit set.

Overall, the patch improves the behavior of the sctp_diag module by correctly handling the idiag_states flag for both listening and non-listening sockets. It ensures that the module does not miss dumping endpoint information when the TCPF_CLOSE bit is set.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of poison pointer values being too big for mmap_min_addr values equal to or less than 1 MB. The current poison pointer values of LIST_POISON{1,2} are changed to smaller values that are suggested by Solar Designer. These smaller values ensure that the poison pointer space below 1 MB is not exhausted in setups with small mmap_min_addr values.

The patch includes proper attribution to the authors and relevant individuals who have been informed about the change. It also provides a clear explanation of the problem and the proposed solution.

Overall, the patch seems to be addressing a specific issue and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is fixing a bug in the loop condition in the switch mode section of the code. The original fix mistakenly modified the loop condition in both the dual_emac mode and switch mode sections, while it should have only been applied to the dual_emac mode section.

The patch correctly reverts the loop condition change in the switch mode section and adds a comment to clarify the intent. Additionally, it fixes a comment that was incorrect.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a bug and improves code clarity.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a warning generated by gcc >= 7 regarding an implicit fall through case label in the `strfilter_node__sprint` function of `util/strfilter.c`. The patch adds the `__fallthrough` annotation to inform the compiler that the fall through is intentional.

Considering that the patch resolves a warning and does not introduce any new functionality or changes, it can be considered a bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue where the sock_tx_timestamp() function in packet_snd() does not work correctly when the sendto syscall is used without a msg_control buffer. This indicates a bug that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch sets the socks.tsflags to sk->sk_tsflags as the default value. This ensures that the timestamping feature works correctly even when the sendto syscall does not have a msg_control buffer.

3. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, which refers to the commit that introduced the bug. This helps in tracking the history of the issue and ensures that the fix is applied to the correct code.

4. The patch has been reported by multiple individuals and has received acknowledgments from other developers, indicating that the issue has been identified and the proposed fix is reasonable.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a known issue and has received appropriate review and acknowledgment. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lockdep splat issue in the l2tp module. The lockdep splat is caused by a possible recursive locking scenario, where the same lock is acquired twice without being released in between. This can lead to a deadlock.

The patch adds a lock class key and sets it for the l2tp socket lock. This allows lockdep to track the locking hierarchy and detect potential deadlocks.

Considering that the patch addresses a lockdep splat issue and introduces a lock class key to prevent potential deadlocks, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the PFMF instruction handler blindly writing the storage key, even if the page is mapped as read-only in the host. This can lead to potential errors.

2. The patch introduces a Copy-On-Write (COW) mechanism before continuing with the operation. This ensures that modifications are made to a new copy of the page, rather than the original read-only page.

3. The patch includes error handling by checking for faults during the COW operation. If a fault occurs, the patch bails out and returns an error code (-EFAULT).

4. The patch includes appropriate sign-offs and review acknowledgments.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue and provides a solution with error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the intention is to fix the write same support in the dm table. The patch checks if the `device_not_write_same_capable()` function returns true, and if so, it should return false in the `dm_table_supports_write_same()` function.

The patch also includes a reported-by tag, signed-off-by tags, and a cc tag for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

However, there is a small issue in the patch. The line `ti->type->iterate_devices(ti, device_not_write_same_capable, NULL)` should have a negation operator (`!`) before it, as it is checking if the iterate_devices function returns false. This seems to be a typo.

Considering the importance of maintaining stability in the Linux kernel, it is recommended to fix this typo before accepting the patch in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` to clear the RWC (Read/Write Clear) bit in the PORTSC (Port Status and Control) register.

2. The function `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` reads the current value of the PORTSC register for a specific port, checks if the RWC bit is set, and if so, clears it by setting the port state to neutral and setting the RWC bit again.

3. The patch modifies the `xhci_bus_resume()` function in `xhci-hub.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit in the PORTSC register for a specific port.

4. The patch also modifies the `handle_port_status()` function in `xhci-ring.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC bit in the PORTSC register for a specific port.

5. The patch adds the declaration of the `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function in `xhci.h`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a new function and using it to clear the RWC and PLC bits in the PORTSC register for specific ports. This patch appears to be a bug fix or improvement related to the xHCI (eXtensible Host Controller Interface) functionality.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to address a potential issue with the linear region size of a 39-bit VA kernel on arm64 architecture. The patch sets the MAX_MEMBLOCK_ADDR value to ensure that the memory that cannot be mapped is clipped before being installed into the memblock memory table.

Considering that the patch has been reviewed and tested by reputable individuals, it is likely that it addresses a valid concern and improves the stability of the Linux kernel on arm64 architecture. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a deadlock issue between the chcp and thaw ioctls in the nilfs2 file system.
   - The deadlock occurs when the thaw ioctl is called while chcp is waiting at nilfs_transaction_begin().
   - The deadlock is 100% reproducible.

2. Cause of the deadlock: The nilfs_ioctl_change_cpmode() function first locks sb->s_umount in read mode and then waits for unfreezing in nilfs_transaction_begin(). However, thaw_super() locks sb->s_umount in write mode, causing the deadlock.

3. Solution: The patch replaces the usage of sb->s_umount in nilfs_ioctl_change_cpmode() with a dedicated mutex (ns_snapshot_mount_mutex) to protect snapshot mounts.

4. Impact: The patch resolves the deadlock issue by ensuring exclusive access to snapshot mounts and preventing the deadlock between chcp and thaw ioctls.

5. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by the author, Ryusuke Konishi, and tested by the same author. It has also been reviewed by Fernando Luis Vazquez Cao.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the call to the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` in the `filelayout_async_handle_error()` function in `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.c`. The reason for removing this call is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call, resulting in a NULL pointer and potentially causing an Oops.

Instead of relying on `nfs4_ds_disconnect()`, the patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid any issues with the device ID. This change ensures that the device ID is marked as invalid, preventing any potential problems.

The patch also removes the declaration and definition of `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` from `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.h` and `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayoutdev.c` respectively, as it is no longer needed.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue and provides a safer alternative. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue where calling dev_close() in the ixgbe_diag_test() function causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes interface routes and addresses. This behavior is inconsistent and not intended when running the offline self-test.

2. The patch suggests calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(), avoiding the clearing of IFF_UP altogether.

3. The patch includes changes to the ixgbe_open() and ixgbe_close() functions in ixgbe_main.c, which are called in the ixgbe_diag_test() function. These changes ensure that the interface is properly brought up or down during the self-test.

4. The patch includes Signed-off-by and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the respective individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses an inconsistency in behavior and improves the handling of interface states during the self-test. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The bug was triggered when memcg_kmem_enabled() became true during a global reclaim, while sc->memcg was NULL.
3. The patch addresses the issue by checking sc->memcg instead of memcg_kmem_enabled(), which is sufficient because shrink_slab ensures that only memcg-aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs when memcg_kmem_enabled is true.
4. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag, providing a reference to the commit that introduced the bug.
5. It also includes a link to the original report and has been tested by the reporter.
6. The patch has been Acked by multiple developers, including Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests reverting a deprecation warning for the SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP module. The reasons for reverting the warning are as follows:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and is considered set in stone. Therefore, there is no need for a deprecation warning.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. Many SCTP appliances are slow to migrate to newer kernels, so it is necessary to support SCTP_SNDRCV on older kernels.

3) Some users may not have the ability to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users will encounter the warning and be stuck with older kernels.

Considering these reasons, it seems reasonable to revert the deprecation warning. The patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and has been reviewed and acknowledged by him. It has also been signed-off by Daniel Borkmann and David S. Miller.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The mcc/mbox lock is not being released when be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

2. The patch introduces a fix by adding a new code block that releases the lock and returns -EBUSY in case be_cmd_copy() fails.

3. The patch also includes a label "unlock" that allows the lock to be released before returning from the function.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes, but rather fixes a potential resource leak.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple authors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an off-by-two bug in the perf hists browser related to column alignment. The bug was introduced by a previous commit that changed the order of columns. The patch adds a boolean variable "first" to keep track of whether it is the first column or not, and adjusts the formatting accordingly.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the DIRECT_IRQ bit in the pinctrl-baytrail driver. It states that the DIRECT_IRQ bit should be cleared for pads using the io mode, as not doing so can prevent the io-based IRQ from being detected.

2. The patch includes a WARN statement to trigger a warning if the DIRECT_IRQ bit is not cleared in the io mode. This helps identify and debug any misconfigurations caused by this issue.

3. The patch also clears other relevant bits (BYT_TRIG_POS, BYT_TRIG_NEG, BYT_TRIG_LVL) to ensure proper functionality.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Mika Westerberg, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and Linus Walleij, which indicates that they take responsibility for the code changes.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to avoid using variable-length arrays in kernel/sys.c. It mentions that variable-length arrays generate worse code for no good reason, unless the function is inlined and the compiler sees the length as a simple constant. Additionally, there seems to be a code generation problem on POWER architecture, where register r28 can get corrupted under certain circumstances.

The patch replaces the variable-length array declaration `char buf[len]` with a fixed-size array `char buf[65]`. This change ensures that the size of the array is always valid and avoids the potential issues caused by variable-length arrays.

The patch also includes the necessary metadata, such as the reported-by, Cc, and signed-off-by fields.

Considering the reasons mentioned in the patch and the proposed solution, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch disables the use of shadow registers by default in the iwlwifi driver. Shadow registers are used to update certain device registers without waking up all components of the device. However, using this feature has caused communication issues and host command timeouts.

2. The patch sets the "shadow_reg_enable" parameter to false for multiple iwlwifi devices (iwl2000, iwl2030, iwl6000, iwl6050, and iwl6000_g2). This effectively disables the use of shadow registers until a fix is available for the bugs associated with this feature.

3. The patch includes appropriate comments indicating that the feature should be fixed in the future.

Considering the communication issues and timeouts caused by using shadow registers, disabling this feature by default is a reasonable approach until the bugs are resolved. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a regression introduced by commit 05cc5a39ddb7 in the bnx2x driver. The regression causes a null pointer dereference when loading the 8021q module on machines with 57710 or 57711 adapters.

The patch adds a check for the specific chip type (chip_is_e1x) and sets the accept_any_vlan flag accordingly. This ensures that the driver correctly handles VLANs for these adapters.

Considering that the patch addresses a regression and has been reported by a reliable source (Otto Sabart from Red Hat), it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() function in the dwc3 gadget driver.
2. The current implementation iterates over all DWC3_ENDPOINTS_NUM (a constant value) endpoints, regardless of whether they are actually present or not.
3. The patch modifies the loop to iterate only over the IN endpoints that are present, based on the num_in_eps parameter.
4. This change prevents potential NULL dereferences of dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).
5. The patch also updates the FIFO size calculation and configuration for each IN endpoint.
6. The change does not affect the OUT endpoints, as they are not modified in this patch.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency and correctness of the dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() function by iterating only over valid IN endpoints. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference in the sctp_process_init function of the SCTP module. This issue can lead to a kernel panic when a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet is received.

2. Cause: The issue occurs because the parameter verification in the INIT chunk does not check parameters inside of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a parameter type other than SCTP_PARAM_IPV4_ADDRESS or SCTP_PARAM_IPV6_ADDRESS, causing the sctp_get_af_specific function to return NULL.

3. Fix: The patch adds a check for NULL after calling sctp_get_af_specific. If the function returns NULL, the loop is broken, preventing the subsequent dereference of the NULL pointer.

4. Impact: The patch fixes a potential kernel panic caused by a NULL pointer dereference. By addressing this issue, the stability and security of the Linux kernel can be improved.

5. Acknowledgments: The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Neil Horman and signed-off by Daniel Borkmann, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on the analysis, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug reported by Dave Jones, which occurs when using a syscall fuzzer while hibernating/resuming. The bug is triggered when poll() is called in entries created by modules, specifically hostname and domainname.

2. The patch introduces two new functions, grab_header() and sysctl_head_finish(), to protect the code accessing ctl_table. These functions ensure that the header is grabbed before accessing ctl_table and released afterward.

3. In the proc_sys_open() function, the patch checks if the header is unregistered using IS_ERR(). If the header is unregistered, the function returns an error.

4. In the proc_sys_poll() function, the patch also checks if the header is unregistered using IS_ERR(). If the header is unregistered, the function returns POLLERR | POLLHUP.

5. The patch includes proper attribution to the reporter (Dave Jones) and the author (Lucas De Marchi), as well as relevant Cc's and Signed-off-by's.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and introduces necessary protection for accessing ctl_table. It has been reviewed and tested, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, even though the Software Developer's Manual (SDM) states that it is invalid.
2. The code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).
3. To get from 64-bit mode to real mode, the patch clears CS.L and CR4.PCIDE.
4. If the vCPU supports long mode, the patch performs additional steps:
   a. It checks if CR4.PCIDE is set and clears it before CR0.PG.
   b. It sets up a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA.
5. It clears CR0.PG and CR0.PE if CR0.PE is set.
6. It clears CR4.PAE if CR4.PAE is set.
7. It sets MSR_EFER to 0 to go back to 32-bit mode.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds support for exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode, which is not explicitly allowed according to the SDM. However, the patch ensures a safe state by clearing necessary registers and flags before transitioning back to real mode or 32-bit mode.

Please note that this recommendation is based solely on the provided information. A more thorough review and testing may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the madvise_free_huge_pmd function in the mm/huge_memory.c file. The issue is that if part pages of a Transparent Huge Page (THP) are discarded, the THP will be split, and fallback Page Table Entry (PTE) operations should be used if splitting succeeds. However, the original code skips the fallback PTE operations after splitting succeeds.

The patch fixes this by making madvise_free_huge_pmd return 0 after successfully splitting the THP. This ensures that the fallback PTE operations will be performed.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Minchan Kim, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted developer.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure correct behavior when discarding part pages of THPs.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for enabling vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a call to `drm_vblank_get()` before setting the `wait_vsync_event` atomic variable to 1. This function increments the reference count for the vblank interrupt handling for the specified CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller) device.

2. After setting the `wait_vsync_event` variable, the patch waits for the variable to be cleared by the vsync interrupt handler. If the variable is not cleared within a certain timeout, a debug message is printed.

3. Finally, the patch adds a call to `drm_vblank_put()` to decrement the reference count for the vblank interrupt handling.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue with vsync interrupt handling and ensures that interrupts are enabled and disabled properly during the wait for vblank.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is aimed at dropping a workaround (WA) for the latest Valleyview (VLV) revision of the Intel graphics driver.

2. The patch proposes a more generic approach to the GRO L2 header check, taking into account the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes.
3. The patch introduces a conditional check based on the value of maclen (skb->dev->hard_header_len) to handle the common case (Ethernet) without using a memcmp() call, improving performance.
4. If maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length), the existing compare_ether_header() function is used to compare the headers.
5. If maclen is not equal to ETH_HLEN, indicating a non-Ethernet header, a memcmp() call is used to compare the headers.
6. The patch also sets the NAPI_GRO_CB(p)->same_flow flag based on the comparison result.

Overall, this patch improves the generic L2 header check in the GRO code and addresses the reported issue. It introduces a more flexible approach and maintains performance optimizations for the common case. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

3. The changes made in the patch are minimal and focused on incrementing the `rx_count` variable to count dropped packets.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior, but rather improves the existing code by ensuring dropped packets are accounted for.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential lost wakeup scenario in the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl function of the staging driver quatech_usb2. Currently, when the usermode app performs the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl, it waits for a change in the modem status by setting the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and calling schedule(). The wakeup is expected to occur when qt2_process_modem_status sets port_extra->shadowMSR to the new modem status.

However, there is a race condition between the loop in qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) and the URB completion in qt2_process_modem_status, which can result in a lost wakeup scenario. This means that the usermode app's task may continue to sleep despite a change in the modem status.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a barrier() to ensure memory ordering, setting the task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and setting it back to TASK_RUNNING when returning from the loop. This ensures that the task is properly woken up and prevents the lost wakeup scenario.

Given that the patch fixes a potential issue and does not introduce any new problems, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific issue related to Big-Endian systems and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called get_random_long(). This function is needed to generate random offsets for the mmap_base address. It operates the same way as get_random_int() but returns an unsigned long value.

2. The shifting constant in mmap_rnd() is fixed to be an unsigned long. This ensures that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is important for x86 systems as its shift instruction uses a 5-bit mask for the shift operand.

3. Calls to get_random_int() are replaced with get_random_long() where appropriate. This ensures that the new function is used consistently throughout the codebase.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Kees Cook and Signed-off-by Daniel Cashman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by trusted individuals.

This bug went unnoticed because the simple domain code did not enter this code path.

2. The patch splits the check for `irq_data == NULL` and adds a separate warning for it. This improves the clarity of the code and makes it easier to identify the specific issue.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and maintainers involved in the patch.

4. The patch also includes appropriate Cc tags to notify relevant individuals and mailing lists about the patch.

5. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list for reference.

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the xmon data-breakpoint feature, which is currently broken. The issue arises when the hw_breakpoint_handler is called by do_break via notifier chains mechanism. If the watchpoint is registered by xmon, the hw_breakpoint_handler does not find any associated perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. As a result, do_break also returns without notifying xmon.

The proposed solution in the patch is to modify the return value of hw_breakpoint_handler when no perf_event is associated with the matched watchpoint. Instead of returning NOTIFY_STOP, which would skip notifying xmon, the patch suggests returning NOTIFY_DONE. This change ensures that the core code continues calling other breakpoint handlers, including the xmon one.

The patch includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the relevant individuals. Additionally, it is marked for consideration in stable releases, suggesting that it addresses a bug that affects stable versions of the Linux kernel.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue with the acpi_find_child_device() function. Currently, if there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope, the first one found to be present is returned. However, this behavior is not defined by the spec, and it may not match the ASL writers' expectations.

The patch modifies the find_child_checks() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change ensures that devices without a valid ACPI/PNP device ID are matched first, allowing for better compatibility with ASL writers' expectations.

The patch has been suggested by Mika Westerberg and signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki. It has also been tested by Hans de Goede.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of the acpi_find_child_device() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock, which is claimed to serialize tve_enable/disable calls. However, the DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions. Therefore, the enable_lock is unnecessary.

2. Holding a spinlock while calling clk_prepare_enable() is incorrect and can cause a might_sleep() warning if debugging is enabled. Removing the enable_lock resolves this issue.

3. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock from the struct imx_tve, as well as the spin_lock_init() call for enable_lock.

4. The tve_enable() and tve_disable() functions no longer acquire and release the enable_lock spinlock.

5. The patch does not introduce any new code or functionality, but rather removes unnecessary code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the code by removing unnecessary locking and resolves a potential issue with clk_prepare_enable(). Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of stack-allocated buffers for DMA in the stk-webcam driver.

2. The patch allocates a buffer using kmalloc() instead of using a stack-allocated buffer. This ensures that the buffer is located in a DMA-enabled area, which is necessary for USB control messages to work correctly.

3. The patch correctly checks if the buffer allocation fails and returns an error (-ENOMEM) in such cases.

4. The patch uses the allocated buffer (buf) in the usb_control_msg() function instead of the stack-allocated buffer (value).

5. The patch also correctly handles the return value of usb_control_msg() and copies the value from the buffer (buf) to the provided pointer (value) if the function call succeeds.

6. The patch introduces a new variable, "smt," which is used to track whether SMT balancing is required.
7. The patch modifies the for_each_domain loop to skip domains that have SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER set and smt is not enabled.
8. The patch also adds a loop to iterate through sched_groups within a domain and find an eligible idle CPU.
9. The patch stops searching for an idle sibling when it reaches the domain that spans the current CPU and the previous CPU.
10. The patch uses appropriate locking mechanisms (rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock) to ensure thread safety.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to SMT balancing and has been tested and reviewed by multiple developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets the queue limits for the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This helps ensure that the command size on the admin queue is not arbitrarily low and that other limitations are properly applied.

2. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function sets various queue limits based on the device-specific properties of the `nvme_ctrl` structure. These limits include maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush requirements, and virtual boundary. By applying these limits, the patch ensures that the admin queue is properly configured.

3. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function is called in two places: during controller initialization (`nvme_init_identify`) and when allocating a new namespace (`nvme_alloc_ns`). This ensures that the admin queue limits are set correctly at the appropriate times.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs, reported-by, tested-by, and reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has undergone review and testing by multiple individuals.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a crash situation in the gs_start_tx() function of the usb gadget serial driver. The issue occurs when the 'port->port_usb' pointer is cleaned in the gserial_disconnect() function, but a request is completed in gs_write_complete() after the pointer has been set to NULL. This leads to a crash in gs_start_tx().

The patch adds a check for the 'port->port_usb' pointer in gs_start_tx() to avoid the crash. If the pointer is NULL, the function returns without performing any further operations.

The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a clear and concise solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Additionally, the patch includes the necessary Fixes and Acked-by tags, indicating that the issue has been identified and reviewed by relevant individuals.

Therefore, considering the nature of the fix and the appropriate tags, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of in_irq() in the intel_check_page_flip() function. It explains that in_irq() only tests for hard-IRQ context, which can lead to warnings when the system is run with the 'threadirqs' option selected.

2. The patch proposes using in_interrupt() instead of in_irq(). This change allows for either type of interrupt and still detects and complains about misuse of the page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

3. The patch includes a reference to a Bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321) that provides additional context and information about the issue being addressed.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the drm/radeon/dpm and drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/rv770_dpm files. It replaces the manual lookup of the max_vddc value with the use of a stored value.

In both files, the patch checks if the vddc value is set to 0xff01. If it is, instead of calling radeon_atom_get_max_vddc to look up the value, it uses the stored max_vddc value from the power_info structure (pi->max_vddc).

This change improves efficiency by avoiding the repeated lookup of the max_vddc value and instead using the stored value directly.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable optimization that does not introduce any new risks or issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to TLB entries in the KVM MIPS implementation. When a guest TLB entry is replaced, only the TLB entries on the local CPU are invalidated. However, this approach can lead to stale TLB mappings if the guest is migrated to a different physical CPU in an SMP host.

To resolve this issue, the patch introduces a new function called `kvm_mips_invalidate_guest_tlb()`. This function is called to indicate a change in guest MMU mappings, allowing for TLB flushes on the current and other CPUs. The function invalidates both user and kernel host ASIDs on other CPUs, ensuring that new ASIDs are generated when the guest runs on those CPUs.

The patch also modifies the `kvm_mips_emul_tlbwi()` and `kvm_mips_emul_tlbwr()` functions to use the `kvm_mips_invalidate_guest_tlb()` function instead of the previous method of invalidating the shadow host TLB.

Additionally, the `kvm_mips_emulate_CP0()` function is modified to invalidate the shadow host TLBs and guest ASIDs on other CPUs when necessary.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to TLB entries and ensures correct behavior when the guest is migrated to different physical CPUs. It introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to handle the TLB invalidation correctly. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The issue is that the FTLB probability is calculated before decoding the config4, resulting in incorrect probability values and inefficient use of FTLB resources.
3. The patch fixes this by configuring the FTLB probability after decoding config4. It ensures that the FTLB is enabled before decoding config4 to reflect the presence of FTLB in the config4 fields.
4. The set_ftlb_enable function is modified to accept flags indicating whether to enable/disable the FTLB and whether to configure the write probability.
5. The decode_configs function is updated to call set_ftlb_enable with the appropriate flags to enable/disable the FTLB and configure the write probability.
6. The patch includes proper sign-offs and references to related patches and discussions.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a clear fix. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue in the rtnl_calcit() function in the RT netlink code. The function is responsible for calculating the minimal size for a netlink dump message.

2. The problem with the current implementation is that it doesn't account for the size of the header of the netlink message.

3. The patch proposes to fix this issue by returning the total size of the message, including the header, using the nlmsg_total_size() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue in the RT netlink code and ensures that the dump message for every network device can be stored correctly.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and the time difference is just a little larger than half a buffer time. In such cases, the current implementation incorrectly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to the comparison with `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that even in scenarios where the time difference is slightly larger than half a buffer time, the interrupt is not considered double acknowledged.

Additionally, the patch acknowledges the potential inaccuracy of `jiffies` due to its integer nature and suggests considering this inaccuracy.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario and improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch is signed-off by Andrzej Hajda and reviewed by Joonyoung Shim, both from Samsung.

3. In the code changes, the patch modifies the enable_vblank function by adding two new lines of code:
   - The first line clears the vsync indicator by writing to the MXR_INT_STATUS register with the MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC mask.
   - The second line enables the vsync interrupt by writing to the MXR_INT_EN register with the MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC mask.

4. The patch also modifies the disable_vblank function by adding one new line of code:
   - The line clears the vsync indicator by writing to the MXR_INT_STATUS register with the MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC mask.

5. Lastly, the patch modifies the mixer_enable function by adding an if statement:
   - The if statement checks if the MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC flag is set in the ctx->int_en variable.
   - If the flag is set, it clears the vsync indicator by writing to the MXR_INT_STATUS register with the MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC mask.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the vsync configuration sequence in the exynos_mixer.c file. The changes made in the patch ensure that the vsync indicator is properly cleared before configuring vsync and that the vsync interrupt is enabled correctly.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Qu Wenruo, David Sterba, and Chris Mason.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a bug and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is aimed at the amdgpu driver in the Linux kernel and addresses the issue of adding PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) fan control attributes when DPM (Dynamic Power Management) is disabled. The patch adds a check to skip the creation of sysfs nodes for PWM attributes if DPM is not enabled.

The rationale behind this patch is that PWM fan control is only available with DPM, and there is no non-DPM support on amdgpu. Therefore, there should never be a crash caused by accessing these sysfs nodes when DPM is disabled. However, the check is added as an extra precaution to ensure safety.

The patch modifies the `hwmon_attributes_visible` function in `amdgpu_pm.c` by adding the check for DPM-enabled before allowing the creation of PWM-related sysfs nodes.

Overall, this patch seems reasonable and addresses a potential issue. It ensures that the sysfs nodes for PWM attributes are not created when DPM is disabled, preventing any potential crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch aims to initialize the checksum field to 0 in the MACB/GEM driver to ensure correct results on transmit in all cases.

2. The patch includes changes since v2, which address a legitimate objection by not blindly modifying SKB contents.

3. The patch also includes changes since v1, where disabling HW checksum offload for Zynq was dropped, and the checksum initialization was made similar to net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c.

4. The patch adds a new inline function `macb_clear_csum` to handle checksum initialization.

5. The `macb_clear_csum` function checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled. If not, it returns 0.

6. If checksum offloading is enabled, the function ensures that the header can be modified and initializes the checksum field to 0. This is required for Zynq, as it was observed that UDP packets with a payload <= 2 would otherwise contain incorrect checksums.

7. In the `macb_start_xmit` function, the `macb_clear_csum` function is called. If it returns an error, the function frees the skb and returns NETDEV_TX_OK.

8. If the `macb_clear_csum` function succeeds, the function proceeds with mapping the socket buffer for DMA transfer.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a race condition in the RX (receive) path of virtio_net.
   - Explanation: The virtio_net driver calls virtqueue_enable_cq after napi_complete, violating the requirement to synchronize virtqueue_enable_cq with virtqueue_add_buf. This can cause the used event to move backwards, resulting in lost interrupts.
   - Impact: In a debug build, this race condition can trigger a panic within START_USE.

2. Solution: The patch fixes the race condition by modifying the order of function calls.
   - Explanation: The patch suggests calling virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare with NAPI_STATE_SCHED set (under the napi lock) and later calling virtqueue_poll with NAPI_STATE_SCHED clear (outside the lock).
   - Impact: This ensures that napi_complete is called to clear NAPI_STATE_SCHED before polling the virtqueue for used buffers, preventing the loss of RX events.

3. Test and Acknowledgment: The patch has been tested and acknowledged by Jason Wang.
   - Reported-by: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>

1. Purpose of the patch:
   The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may not be fully initialized, resulting in default values. In such cases, if a panel with a reasonable EDID is available, the patch replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if the resolutions don't match. Systems without a valid internal panel EDID will still use the BIOS native mode.

2. Patch implementation:
   The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the `radeon_connectors.c` file. It introduces logic to check if the EDID preferred mode matches the native mode. If they don't match, the patch replaces the native mode with the preferred mode. Additionally, if the native mode details are not available from the EDID, the patch attempts to retrieve them from the probed modes.

3. Patch review:
   The patch has been reviewed by Matthew Garrett and Alex Deucher, who have provided their signed-off-by statements. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and is considered suitable for inclusion.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses two issues in the nft_set_bitmap module of the netfilter subsystem. 

1. The first issue is related to the assumption that the element key is always a u32 integer, regardless of the set key length. This assumption is incorrect because certain elements, such as TCP port numbers, are only 16 bits. As a result, when using the nft_payload expression to retrieve the TCP destination port (dport) and store it in the dreg register, the dport will be stored in bits 0-15, with bits 16-31 padded with zeros. However, on big-endian systems, treating this register as a u32 integer would result in an element key larger than 65535, causing out-of-bounds access during lookup in the bitmap set. The patch fixes this issue by treating the element key as a u8 or u16 integer based on the set's klen (key length).

2. The second issue occurs when adding elements with comments in the bitmap set. Although the comments are eventually ignored, treating the element key as a u32 integer causes the comments to become part of the element key. Consequently, the element key becomes larger than 65535, leading to out-of-bounds access. The patch resolves this problem by correctly treating the element key as a u8 or u16 integer based on the set's klen.

Overall, the patch addresses these issues by modifying the nft_bitmap_location function to handle different key lengths correctly and updating the relevant functions to use the modified nft_bitmap_location function.

Considering the nature of the issues and the provided fixes, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

2. The patch enables the use of the CLKR/CLKX pin to inject a reference clock in setups where the McBSP is the master and only one of the rx and tx lines is used. This allows for the CLKR pin to be used to inject an external reference clock.

3. The patch ensures that set_dai_sysclk() is called after set_dai_fmt() to make the CLKR/CLKX pin work correctly.

4. The patch has been tested on a beagleboard-xm using McBSP1 to drive an i2s DAC through the tx lines (CLKX, FSX, DX), and it successfully uses the CLKR pin to inject an external reference clock.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, including Thomas Niederprm, Peter Ujfalusi, and Mark Brown.

6. The changes in the patch modify the OMAP McBSP driver (sound/soc/omap/omap-mcbsp.c) to fix the pinmux configuration and ensure correct behavior.

Considering that this patch addresses a performance issue and is a bug fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: On heavy paging load, some guest CPUs enter a loop in the gmap_ipte_notify function, causing stalled CPUs inside the guest.
   - This issue affects the stability and performance of the system.

2. Cause: The gmap_ipte_notifier attempts to map a user page and ensure that the page table entry (pte) is valid and writable. However, due to the software change bit tracking, the pte can become read-only (and only software writable) if the page is clean.
   - This causes the page to remain clean and never become writable again, leading to the loop in the gmap_ipte_notify function.

3. Solution: Instead of using the gmap_ipte_notifier, the patch suggests using fixup_user_fault, which guarantees to call handle_mm_fault.
   - This change ensures that the page is properly handled and made writable when necessary.

4. Impact: The patch modifies the gmap_ipte_notify function by replacing the get_user_pages call with fixup_user_fault.
   - This change resolves the issue of stalled CPUs and improves the stability and performance of the system.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue and provides a suitable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

7. The patch also includes a module parameter description update to reflect the corrected behavior.

Overall, the patch seems to address a known issue and provides a logical correction. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to prevent stacking filesystems (such as ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using procfs as the lower filesystem. It states that there is too much magic going on inside procfs, and there is no good reason to stack filesystems on top of it.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:
- The s_stack_depth field of the superblock structure is set to FILESYSTEM_MAX_STACK_DEPTH, indicating that procfs is not a stacking filesystem.
- If the proc_parse_options function fails to parse the options, the superblock is deactivated and an error is returned.

The reasoning behind this patch is that procfs performs access checks in VFS open handlers, and ecryptfs, for example, calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't drop privileges. Therefore, stacking filesystems on top of procfs can lead to unexpected behavior.

Considering the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent potential issues caused by stacking filesystems on top of procfs.

   Fix: The patch sets msg_namelen to 0 early, ensuring that uninitialized memory is not leaked.

2. Issue: Missing update of msg_namelen for datagram sockets during receive shutdown.
   Explanation: The code also misses updating msg_namelen for datagram sockets when the socket is shutting down during receive.
   Fix: The patch addresses this issue by setting msg_namelen to 0 early, ensuring consistency.

The patch resolves both issues by setting msg_namelen to 0 early, and it will be updated later if the msg_name member needs to be filled. This fix prevents the leakage of uninitialized kernel stack memory and ensures proper behavior during socket shutdown.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c) in the drm/i915 driver.

2. The reason for reverting the commit is that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

3. The original patch is considered nonsensical since the backtraces in the referenced bugzilla are about gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

4. The patch includes changes in the intel_lvds_get_config() function in intel_lvds.c and the intel_gmch_panel_fitting() function in intel_panel.c.

5. In the intel_lvds_get_config() function, the patch adds code to set the dither state in the gmch_pfit.control register for gen2/3 hardware.

6. In the intel_gmch_panel_fitting() function, the patch ensures that pre-965 hardware sets dither correctly for 18bpp panels.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a reported issue with dithering on gen2/3 hardware and reverts a previous commit that was considered nonsensical. Additionally, the changes in the code appear to be correct and necessary for proper dithering functionality.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the vgic-v3.c file in the virt/kvm/arm/vgic directory. It addresses an issue related to level interrupts in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

The patch introduces changes to the vgic_v3_fold_lr_state() function. Previously, when reading back from the list registers, two actions were performed for level interrupts: clearing the soft-pending bit if the interrupt is no longer pending in the list register and resampling the line level to propagate it to the pending state.

However, the patch suggests that these two actions should not be linked, and the line level should always be resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. This is important to avoid injecting spurious interrupts that have already been retired.

The modified code now checks if the interrupt configuration is VGIC_CONFIG_LEVEL. If it is, the patch ensures that the line level is always resampled. Additionally, if the interrupt is not pending in the list register, the soft-pending state is cleared.

The changes seem reasonable and address a potential issue with spurious interrupts. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing redundant code that checks the resource with `devm_ioremap_resource` in multiple drivers.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit in the usbnet_stop() function of the usbnet.c file. The problem is that the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit needs to be checked before it is cleared when dev->flags is set to 0.

The patch introduces a new variable, mpn, which is assigned the value of !test_and_clear_bit(EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM, &dev->flags). This ensures that the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit is read before it is cleared.

The patch then modifies the conditional statement that checks if the manage_power function should be called. Instead of directly calling test_and_clear_bit(EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM, &dev->flags), it uses the newly introduced mpn variable.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and introduces a necessary fix to ensure the correct behavior of the usbnet_stop() function.

This fix is necessary because the memory allocated during xfrm_state_construct() was not being freed, leading to a memory leak.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it addresses a memory leak, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch has also been Acked-by Rami Rosen, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue introduced by commit c702418f8a2f, which removed zone watermark checks from the compaction code in kswapd but left in the zone congestion clearing. This resulted in inappropriate zone congestion clearing during higher order reclaims, which affected the reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages.

The proposed solution is to remove the clearing from the zone compaction section entirely. The preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd will clear the congestion flag if the zone is considered balanced.

The patch has been reviewed by Johannes Weiner and Rik van Riel, and it has been signed-off by Linus Torvalds.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the file `drivers/char/msm_smd_pkt.c` and removes the usage of the `IS_ERR()` function. Instead, it checks if the memory allocation function `kzalloc()` returns NULL. If it does, it prints an error message using `pr_err()`.

The change is made to improve the code by using the appropriate error handling mechanism. The `IS_ERR()` function is typically used to check if a pointer returned by a function call is an error pointer or a valid pointer. However, in this case, the memory allocation functions return NULL on failure, not an error pointer.

By removing the unnecessary `IS_ERR()` check and directly checking for NULL, the code becomes more straightforward and easier to understand.

Considering the simplicity and correctness of the patch, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

5. The patch modifies the sysfs_list_show function to handle the buffer overflow issue. It checks if the output will be truncated and adjusts the output accordingly. If the output cannot hold the remaining requests, it adds a truncation indicator ("\t...\n") and breaks the loop.

6. The patch returns the correct length of the output, ensuring that the sysfs file is read correctly.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the buffer overflow issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the run queue in the dm (device mapper) subsystem. The patch adds a call to "blk_run_queue_async(q)" after requeuing a request in the "old_requeue_request" function.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. The problem being fixed: The patch addresses a situation where a requeued request may remain in the queue indefinitely if there are no other I/O activities to the device. This can lead to requests being stuck and not processed, causing potential performance issues or even system hangs.

2. The impact of the fix: The patch adds a call to "blk_run_queue_async(q)" to ensure that the requeued request is processed promptly. This change should prevent requests from getting stuck in the queue and improve overall system responsiveness.

3. The scope of the fix: The patch appears to be specific to the dm subsystem and does not affect other parts of the kernel. This limits the potential for introducing new issues or regressions.

Based on these considerations, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue, has a clear impact on improving system behavior, and has a limited scope of changes.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by three individuals: Daniel Borkmann, Nicolas Dichtel, and Alexei Starovoitov. Their acknowledgment indicates that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

5. The patch is also signed-off by David S. Miller, the maintainer of the net/core/sock_diag.c file.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch has been thoroughly reviewed and addresses a specific issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue introduced by commit df9e26d093d3, which added support for the RTC source clock on Exynos3250 SoCs. However, this support caused an initialization failure on SoCs that do not require the RTC source clock.

The patch modifies the code to conditionally enable the RTC source clock based on the needs_src_clk flag. If the flag is set, the patch attempts to get the rtc_src clock and enables it. If the clock retrieval fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns with the appropriate error code.

By making this change, the patch ensures that the initialization failure is avoided on non-Exynos3250 SoCs, where the RTC source clock is not needed.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Linus Torvalds, which adds credibility to its correctness.

Therefore, considering the nature of the fix and the review process, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch and giving it an ACK to be included in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a problem in the XFS file system where torn log write detection runs unconditionally at mount time, regardless of whether the log is dirty or clean. This can lead to false positive CRC verification errors and failed mounts when a cleanly unmounted filesystem is mounted on a system with an incompatible architecture.

The patch updates the log head/tail discovery code to only run torn write detection when the log is not clean. This means that something other than an unmount record resides at the head of the log and log recovery is imminent. This change ensures that log recovery is only performed on the same type of host that wrote the content of the dirty log, preventing CRC failures from being treated as corruptions in that scenario.

The patch has been reported and tested by Jan Beulich and reviewed by Dave Chinner. It also includes the necessary sign-offs.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a targeted solution. It has been reviewed and tested, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Considering these points, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the live deadlock problem until a proper fix is implemented.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, assuming that the interrupt trigger is already properly configured. However, this assumption is not safe to make as some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot.

2. The patch fixes the issue by forcing the IRQ to trigger on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. This ensures that the IRQ is properly configured even on boards where interrupt triggers are disabled.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes are localized to the at86rf230 driver in the file at86rf230.c, minimizing the potential impact on other parts of the kernel.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() function called from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() may cause global P-state limits to change, which is confusing and unnecessary.

2. The patch explains that in passive mode, the global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor and are not taken into account by governors when making decisions. Therefore, making the global limits follow the per-policy limits serves no purpose and may go against user expectations.

3. The patch removes the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(), reducing the code size by a few lines.

4. The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. It removes the only piece of code updating the per-CPU limits in that mode, so the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account, as expected.

5. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit (001c76f05b01) that introduced the issue.

6. The patch is signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch is a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the wm8994 codec driver where enum controls (DRC Mode and EQ Mode) are accessed incorrectly using `value.integer.value[]` instead of `value.enumerated.item[]`.

2. The incorrect access can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect values being used for DRC and EQ modes.

3. The patch correctly updates the access to use `value.enumerated.item[]` for both `wm8994_put_drc_enum()` and `wm8994_put_retune_mobile_enum()` functions.

4. The patch is signed-off by both Takashi Iwai and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the owner field of the /dev/radio# device fops in the snd-tea575x-tuner module. The previous implementation allowed the module to be rmmod-ed while the device is open, leading to potential issues.

2. The patch modifies the snd_tea575x_init() function in the sound/tea575x-tuner.c file to include a struct module *owner parameter. This change ensures that the owner field of the fops is set correctly.

3. The patch also updates the maxiradio_probe() function in the drivers/media/radio/radio-maxiradio.c file and the fmr2_probe() function in the drivers/media/radio/radio-sf16fmr2.c file to pass the THIS_MODULE macro as the owner parameter when calling snd_tea575x_init().

4. Additionally, the patch modifies the snd_tea575x struct in the include/sound/tea575x-tuner.h file to include a struct v4l2_file_operations fops field. This field is then initialized in the snd_tea575x_init() function to ensure the correct owner is set.

5. Finally, the patch removes the .owner field assignment from the tea575x_fops struct in the sound/i2c/other/tea575x-tuner.c file and assigns the tea->fops.owner field in the snd_tea575x_init() function instead.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of the module being unloaded while the device is open and ensures that the owner field of the fops is correctly set. It also updates the necessary functions and structures to accommodate these changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where a driver fails to compile when CONFIG_OF is disabled. The error occurs because the driver is trying to access an undeclared identifier, causing compilation to fail.

The patch modifies the of_match_device() function in the include/linux/of_device.h header file. It adds a new inline function, __of_match_device(), which nullifies the table pointer if CONFIG_OF is disabled. The of_match_device() macro is then defined to call __of_match_device() with the matches and dev parameters.

By nullifying the table pointer when CONFIG_OF is disabled, the patch ensures that the driver can compile successfully even when CONFIG_OF is not enabled.

The patch fixes a bug in the NFSv4 protocol decoding and ensures that unrequested attributes are ignored. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, which adds credibility to its correctness.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to memory attribute inconsistencies when using fixmap on ARM architectures.
2. The current implementation of fixmap uses hard-coded attributes, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and cache inconsistencies on systems with multiple CPU clusters.
3. The patch proposes to refactor the initialization code to use the same memory attributes (pgprot_kernel) that the rest of the kernel uses.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the variables `record_size`, `console_size`, and `ftrace_size` can be set to 0 to disable the feature. However, calling `rounddown_pow_of_two(0)` is undefined behavior. To fix this, the patch introduces a condition using the `is_power_of_2()` function to check if the value is a power of 2 before calling `rounddown_pow_of_two()`.

This change ensures that the `rounddown_pow_of_two()` function is not called with a value of 0, avoiding undefined behavior. The patch also includes the necessary checks for all the relevant variables.

Given that the patch addresses a bug and provides a proper fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The late_alloc() function used by create_mapping_late() does not call pgtable_page_ctor() on PTE pages it allocates, leaving the per-page spinlock uninitialized.
   - Explanation: The late_alloc() function is responsible for PTE allocation, but it fails to initialize the per-page spinlock.
   - Impact: This can lead to a crash when the UEFI memory attributes table code is executed.

2. Crash Scenario: The crash occurs when the UEFI page tables, which are not owned by init_mm, are accessed without being covered by fully constructed struct pages.

3. Fix: The patch adds an unconditional call to pgtable_page_ctor() in late_alloc() to ensure that the per-page spinlock is properly initialized.

4. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the issue.

5. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Ard Biesheuvel and Russell King.

Considering the impact of the issue and the provided fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to changing MTU under heavy load when using per-cpu processing. It states that changing MTU can block all port's interrupts and prevent data transmission after the change.

2. The patch introduces two new functions, `mvneta_percpu_enable` and `mvneta_percpu_disable`, which are used to enable and disable percpu interrupts for the time when TXQs and RXQs are reconfigured.

3. In the `mvneta_change_mtu` function, before stopping the device, the patch calls `mvneta_percpu_disable` to disable percpu interrupts. This ensures that interrupts are disabled during the reconfiguration process.

4. After reconfiguring the queues and changing the MTU, the patch calls `mvneta_percpu_enable` to enable percpu interrupts again. This is done before starting the device and bringing the port up.

5. The patch also includes a separate function `mvneta_mdio_remove`, which is unrelated to the main issue being addressed. This function is not modified by the patch.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to changing MTU under heavy load when using per-cpu processing. It introduces the necessary changes to disable and enable percpu interrupts during the reconfiguration process. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, to lock access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. This is necessary because other patches in the series introduce runtime modifications to the resource tree that can occur on multiple threads. Therefore, introducing locking ensures thread safety.

2. The patch adds the `down(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` call before iterating over the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree, indicating that the lock is acquired before accessing the tree.

3. The `up(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` call is added before returning from the function, ensuring that the lock is released.

4. The patch also introduces a new variable, `retval`, to store the return value of the function. This allows for proper handling of the return value in case of failure.

5. The `goto exit` statement is used to jump to the exit label and release the lock before returning from the function.

6. The patch does not modify any existing functionality or behavior, but rather adds necessary locking to support future modifications.

Based on these observations, it appears that the patch is well-structured and addresses the need for locking in the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch fixes a warning in the alloc_huge_page/dequeue_huge_page_vma functions in mm/hugetlb.c. The warning suggests that the local variable "page" may be used uninitialized in the alloc_huge_page function.

2. The patch initializes the "page" variable explicitly to NULL, ensuring that it is always initialized, even in corner cases where the nodemask from vma policy does not intersect with the nodemask from cpuset.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch is relatively small and addresses a specific issue, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch removes an unused define called "cpuidle_coupled_lock" in the cpuidle/coupled.c file. The patch was found with the -RT patch enabled but is applicable to non-RT as well. It fixes a compilation warning that occurs when using the multi_v7_defconfig+PREEMPT_RT_FULL=y configuration.

Considering that the define is unused and removing it resolves a compilation warning, it seems reasonable to accept this patch. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to device name collisions when using 10-bit slave addresses in the I2C protocol.

7. The patch does not introduce any new issues or risks.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary fix for preventing device name collisions with 10-bit slave addresses. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a warning message that occurs when running netperf from a host with a netem qdisc attached to the egress interface. The warning message indicates that netem is not prepared to handle GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) packets.

2. Solution: The patch proposes segmenting the skb (socket buffer) in a similar fashion to the way it is done in __dev_queue_xmit, with some minor changes. When a decision is made to corrupt an skb, if the frame is GSO, it is segmented, the first segment is corrupted, and the remaining segments are enqueued.

3. Testing: The patch has been successfully tested by the patch author on the latest net kernel.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the netem_enqueue function in the sch_netem.c file. It introduces a new netem_segment function to segment GSO packets and enqueue the segments. It also modifies the netem_enqueue function to handle the segmented packets correctly.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a solution that has been tested successfully. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch removes the ONDA MT825UP product ID from the option.c driver in the USB serial subsystem. The reason given is that some early devices did not expose a proper CDC descriptor, but this was fixed with a firmware update from the vendor. The patch suggests that actual devices can now be driven by cdc_acm.c and cdc_ether.c.

Looking at the code changes, the patch removes the ONDA_VENDOR_ID and ONDA_MT825UP definitions from option.c. It also removes the corresponding USB_DEVICE entry from the option_ids array.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is removing support for the ONDA MT825UP modem, which was previously supported by the option.c driver. If the firmware update from the vendor has indeed fixed the CDC descriptor issue, and the modem can now be driven by cdc_acm.c and cdc_ether.c, then it might be reasonable to remove the specific support for this modem from the option.c driver.

However, without further information about the impact of this change and whether it has been tested on a variety of devices, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. Therefore, I would recommend further testing and verification before accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch is well-documented, has received recommendations from experienced developers, and addresses a specific need for handling division of 64-bit numbers by long data types. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for handling encapsulation offloads when computing segment lengths in the network core.
2. If the `encapsulation` flag is set in the `skb` structure, the patch calculates the segment length by adding the size of the inner network headers (`inner_tcp_hdrlen`) to the transport header length (`thlen`).
3. If the `encapsulation` flag is not set, the patch calculates the segment length using only the transport header length (`thlen`).
4. The patch correctly handles the case when the GSO type is either TCPv4 or TCPv6, by adding the transport header length (`thlen`) to the GSO size.
5. The patch also accounts for the case when the GSO type is UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload), where the GSO size already includes the L4 (UDP) header length.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to encapsulation offloads and correctly calculates the segment length based on the presence of encapsulation and the GSO type. It does not introduce any obvious regressions or potential issues.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "SUNRPC: set per-net PipeFS superblock before notification" and is signed-off by Stanislav Kinsbursky and Trond Myklebust.

2. The patch modifies the rpc_fill_super function in the net/sunrpc/rpc_pipe.c file.

3. In the patch, a case is described where an RPC client's dentries are no longer held by anyone except the notification callback after the MOUNT event. This means that when the client is released, its dentries need to be destroyed, which requires the per-net PipeFS superblock to be set.

4. The patch adds the line "sn->pipefs_sb = sb;" after the dprintk statement. This sets the per-net PipeFS superblock to the provided super_block pointer.

5. The patch then calls the blocking_notifier_call_chain function to send a pipefs MOUNT notification for the specified net. If an error occurs, it jumps to the err_depopulate label.

6. If the MOUNT notification is successful, the patch returns 0, indicating success.

7. If an error occurs during the MOUNT notification, the patch calls the blocking_notifier_call_chain function again to send a pipefs UMOUNT notification. It then sets "sn->pipefs_sb = NULL;" to clear the per-net PipeFS superblock.

8. Finally, the patch calls the __rpc_depopulate function to destroy the client's dentries and returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific case where the per-net PipeFS superblock needs to be set before notification, ensuring proper cleanup of dentries when the client is released.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c file.

2. The issue is that rep_data is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch modifies the wacom_get_report() function call by removing the address-of operator (&) before rep_data in the last argument.

4. The patch also updates the condition in the if statement to check if the result is greater than or equal to 0 and if rep_data[1] is greater than 2.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug and does not introduce any new issues. Additionally, it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, which adds to its credibility.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to dropped Rx data in non-DMA transfer mode. The patch modifies the pch_spi_handler_sub function in spi-topcliff-pch.c to address the read complete condition issue.

Upon analyzing the patch, it seems to be a valid fix for the reported problem. The patch checks if the transfer is complete by comparing the tx_index and rx_index with bpw_len. If they are equal, it disables interrupts, sets the transfer_complete and transfer_active flags, and wakes up the wait queue. Otherwise, it logs an error message.

Considering the patch's purpose and the changes made, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers is necessary to ensure the patch's correctness and compatibility with the stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a bug in the rtl8821ae driver related to an array size mismatch. The bug causes an undefined behavior warning and potential data corruption. 

Although Linus Torvalds mentioned that the bug seems benign and doesn't affect functionality, it is still a bug that should be fixed. The patch changes the size of the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct size.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to ensure the driver is fixed and prevent any potential issues or confusion in the future.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using `truncate_pagecache()` instead of `truncate_pagecache_range()` in the collapse range. This change is justified because the intention is to truncate the page cache from the given offset to the end of the file.

2. The patch mentions that `truncate_pagecache()` also removes private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range. This is important because the end of the file is being shifted, and any private COWed pages in that range should be discarded.

3. The patch modifies the code by replacing the `truncate_pagecache_range()` function call with `truncate_pagecache()`.

4. The patch includes the necessary sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The driver is calling s3c_hsotg_phy_disable three times instead of once when it is removed. This causes the phy reference counter to go below zero and subsequent module inserts to fail.

2. The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop. This is because s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which in turn calls s3c_hsotg_pullup, which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Therefore, there is no need to disable the phy again in s3c_hsotg_remove.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch is also marked for stable releases (Cc: stable), indicating that it is considered important for maintaining stability.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM. This is necessary to allow dynamic reconfiguration of trapping on a per-vCPU basis.

2. The patch mimics what KVM/arm64 already does, which is to have a per-vCPU HCR field initialized at setup time.

3. The patch modifies the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_arm.h file by removing the HCR_VIRT_EXCP_MASK definition, which is no longer needed.

4. The patch adds a new field, "hcr," to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch in the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_host.h file. This field will hold the HYP trapping configuration.

5. The patch also adds a new field, "irq_lines," to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch in the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_host.h file. This field will hold the IRQ and FIQ levels.

6. The patch modifies the arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.c file to define the offset of the new "hcr" field in the struct kvm_vcpu.

7. The patch modifies the arch/arm/kvm/guest.c file to initialize the "hcr" field of each vCPU with the HCR_GUEST_MASK value.

8. The patch modifies the arch/arm/kvm/interrupts_head.S file to configure the HCR register based on the operation (vmentry or not). If it's a vmentry, the HCR register is ORed with the IRQ lines value. Otherwise, the HCR register is set to 0.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary addition to the Linux kernel for KVM/ARM. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing groups with stopped tasks. It identifies that the removal of the "is_task_frozen_enough" function in a previous commit caused freezing to break for groups with stopped tasks.

2. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it at the original locations where freezing is checked (update_if_frozen and try_to_freeze_cgroup). This ensures that both frozen tasks and stopped tasks are considered as frozen enough.

3. The patch includes a testcase that verifies the fix by creating a freezer cgroup, stopping a task within it, and checking if the freezer state transitions to "FROZEN" correctly.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Li Zefan, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

5. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by tags from the author and the reviewer.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for the identified issue and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the netfilter xt_hashlimit module related to the removal of proc entries during the destruction of a network namespace. The bug causes a splat (warning message) to be displayed when using xt_hashlimit with both IPv4 and IPv6 together.

The patch fixes the issue by ensuring that both IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories are always removed during the netns destroy path. It introduces a new function, htable_remove_proc_entry(), which is called from htable_destroy() to remove the proc entries.

The patch also includes proper Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific bug and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch modifies the behavior of the debug_dma_mapping_error function to correctly set the map_err_type field for multiple mappings of a buffer. It ensures that MAP_ERR_CHECKED is set on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address, even in the case of non-IOMMU.

3. The patch also mentions a secondary side effect where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type in the case of multiple buffers using the same address. However, it suggests that this behavior may be preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the author and reviewers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue and improving the behavior of the DMA debug API. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be well-documented, tested, and addresses a specific issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that caused a regression for users who define both console=ttyS1 and console=ttyS0 on the command line.
2. The original behavior of the kernel was to send kernel log messages only to the first mentioned ttyS* console, as documented in the serial-console.rst file.
3. The previous commit changed the order in which command line parameters are searched, causing the kernel log messages to go to the last mentioned ttyS* console instead of the first one.
4. It was initially thought that defining both console=ttyS1 and console=ttyS0 didn't make sense, but it was later realized that systemd handles console= parameters and it can instantiate one serial-getty@.service on the main kernel console.
5. The main console is determined by the last one listed on the kernel command line, as mentioned in the systemd documentation.
6. In the specific use case described, the system is running in qemu, where the first serial port is used to store messages into a file and the second one is used for login via a socket.
7. The fix caused a regression related to userspace (systemd) and needs to be reverted.
8. Additionally, it was found that the fix only partially helped, as the messages were still duplicated when the boot console was removed early by late_initcall(printk_late_init).

Considering the above analysis, it appears that reverting the previous commit would address the regression and restore the expected behavior. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a typo in the documentation regarding the descriptor empty bit (DESCE) in the HSU DMA driver. The patch correctly states that the DESCE bit is set to 1 when the descriptor is empty, and the status register at the end of a transfer usually returns all DESCE bits set, making it never zero. This clarifies the behavior of the DESCE bit.

2. The patch also addresses the issue of the CDESC bits that encode the current descriptor on which an interrupt has been asserted. In cases where multiple descriptors are programmed, the value of the CDESC bits might be non-zero. The patch removes the DESCE and CDESC bits from the DMA channel status register (HSU_CH_SR) when reading it, ensuring that the correct value is obtained.

3. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by commit 2b49e0c56741.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Andy Shevchenko and Vinod Koul, who are both recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

5. The patch is also marked for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for the mentioned issues and has undergone the necessary review process. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes uninitialized data usage in the hns_dsaf_set_promisc_tcam() function. The error message from gcc-7.0.1 indicates that the 'tbl_tcam_data.low.val' and 'tbl_tcam_data.high.val' variables may be used uninitialized in this function.

2. The patch initializes the tbl_tcam_data and tbl_tcam_mask structures using memset() before using them. This ensures that the data is properly initialized and avoids potential issues caused by uninitialized variables.

3. The patch also includes the "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the fix and provides a clear reference to the original problem.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Arnd Bergmann and David S. Miller, indicating that it has undergone a review process and received approval from relevant stakeholders.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a valid issue and provides a safe and necessary fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the SP (Spatial Reuse Protocol) in the mac80211 subsystem. The problem occurs when a frame carrying the IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP bit is enqueued during the SP. This can prevent the SP from being closed, leading to a situation where no new SP is opened, and the client's poll frames are not responded to.

To resolve this issue, the patch manually clears the WLAN_STA_SP flag if a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU session. This ensures that even if the client does not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was identified by Alesya Shapira, and it is also signed-off by Emmanuel Grumbach and Johannes Berg, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific problem and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread during suspend or hibernation. It explains that if usb-stor-scan is left freezable without actually freezing, the freezer will wait for it to exit, and threads waiting for scanning to finish will no longer be blocked.

2. To achieve this, the patch introduces changes to usb-stor-scan:
   a. It replaces set_freezable() with set_freezable_with_signal() to request a fake signal when freezing.
   b. It replaces wait_event_freezable_timeout() with wait_event_interruptible_timeout() to avoid freezing.

3. The patch includes proper documentation explaining the rationale behind the changes and the potential issues that could arise if freezing is not handled correctly.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Alan Stern, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the CPU load average increase caused by the SENSE_PORT command in the mlx4_cmd_wait function. Currently, the wait_for_completion_timeout call puts the kernel thread into the uninterruptible state, contributing to the CPU load average. 

The patch suggests using wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout instead, which puts the thread in the interruptible state, preventing it from contributing to the CPU load average. Additionally, in the case of an interrupted wait, the patch treats it as if the SENSE_PORT command returned port_type = NONE.

The fix is suggested by Gideon Naim and Bart Van Assche, who are associated with Mellanox Technologies, a reputable company in the field. The patch is also signed-off by multiple developers, including David S. Miller.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue, provides a clear solution, and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

6. The changes include modifying the `set_send_length` function in `chip.c` to adjust the credit return thresholds for all remapped kernel send contexts. Additionally, the `pio_map_init` function in `pio.c` is modified to assign send contexts and adjust the credit return threshold.

7. The modifications in the patch appear to be well-structured and follow the existing code style.

Based on these observations, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue, has been reviewed, and the changes are reasonable. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Description of the issue:
   The patch describes an off-by-one error in the continuation handling of /proc/net/route. When generating /proc/net/route, a header is emitted followed by a line for each route. If a short read is performed, the process is restarted based on the open file descriptor. However, the calculation of the start point fails to consider that the 0th entry is the header, leading to the skipping of the first entry during a continuation read.

2. Reproduction of the issue:
   The patch provides a comparison to demonstrate the issue. By using the "while read" command to read /proc/net/route and redirecting the output to file A, and then using "cat" to read /proc/net/route and redirecting the output to file B, a diff is performed between A and B. The diff output shows that the first non-title element is lost in the "while read" case, and an entry around the 8K mark in the "cat" case.

3. Fix:
   The patch fixes the off-by-one error by adjusting the position calculation when reacquiring the position on continuation. The decrement of "pos" is moved before the comparison, ensuring that the first entry is not skipped.

4. Fixes and Acked-by:
   The patch references a previous commit that introduced the issue and provides a BugLink to a relevant bug report. It also includes an Acked-by tag from Alexander Duyck and is signed-off by Andy Whitcroft and David S. Miller.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a deadlock issue between rmmod and set_mode functions in the IB/ipoib driver.

2. Patch details: The patch modifies the set_mode function in the ipoib_cm.c file and the ipoib_set_mode function in the ipoib_main.c file.

3. Root cause analysis: The deadlock occurs because the set_mode function locks the sys/fs lock first and then tries to lock the rtnl_lock, while the rmmod function takes the rtnl_lock first and then tries to lock the sys/fs lock. This creates a deadlock situation.

4. Patch solution: The patch modifies the set_mode function to check if ipoib_set_mode returned -EBUSY, indicating that the rtnl_lock is still held. If so, it does not unlock the rtnl_lock. This ensures that the lock is released only when ipoib_set_mode returns 0 or a value other than -EBUSY.

5. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the issue and provides the necessary information for tracking the fix.

6. Stability: The patch does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially destabilize the system. It only addresses a deadlock issue.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to resolve the deadlock issue in the IB/ipoib driver.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch fixes alignment issues for ARM64 architecture in the v4l2-compat-ioctl32 file.

2. In the struct v4l2_standard32, the id field is changed from an array of two __u32 elements to a single compat_u64 element. This change ensures proper alignment for ARM64 kernels without breaking compatibility with AMD64.

3. In the put_v4l2_standard32 function, the copy_to_user call for the id field is replaced with put_user. This change aligns with the new field type.

4. In the struct v4l2_input32, the std field is changed from v4l2_std_id to compat_u64. This change aligns with the new field type.

5. The struct v4l2_input32 is no longer explicitly packed using __attribute__ ((packed)).

6. In the struct v4l2_event32, a new union member compat_s64 value64 is added to ensure proper alignment for ARM64.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses alignment issues specific to ARM64 architecture without breaking compatibility with AMD64. The changes made seem reasonable and necessary for proper functioning on ARM64. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a module parameter to disable the use of efivars as a pstore backend. This is important because writing too much data to UEFI variables can lead to bricking machines in some firmware implementations.

2. The patch also adds a config option, CONFIG_EFI_VARS_PSTORE_DEFAULT_DISABLE, to allow setting the default value of the pstore_module parameter to true (disabled by default). This provides flexibility for system administrators to control the usage of efivars as a pstore backend.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Seth Forshee, Matt Fleming, and others, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch includes relevant Cc's to notify other stakeholders, such as Josh Boyer, Matthew Garrett, Seiji Aguchi, and Tony Luck, ensuring that they are aware of the changes.

1. The patch addresses an issue in the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() functions, where the use count of md5sig_pool is incorrectly increased for each tcp md5sig peer. This can lead to incorrect assumptions in tcp_v4_clear_md5_list().

2. The patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first tcp md5sig peer. This ensures that the use count is correctly managed.

3. The patch also adds checks to tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to verify if md5sig->entries4 and md5sig->entries6 are zero before allocating md5sig_pool. If they are zero, it means that there are no existing entries, and md5sig_pool allocation is required.

4. Additionally, the patch includes changes in tcp_v4_md5_do_del() and tcp_v6_md5_do_del() to properly handle the freeing of md5sig_pool when entries are deleted.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and ensures proper handling of md5sig_pool references in the TCP code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current implementation uses a static variable `hidg_desc` to store the report descriptor, which can be overwritten if multiple instances of the `hid` function are used.

2. The patch introduces a local copy of `hidg_desc` called `hidg_desc_copy` in the `hidg_setup` function. This ensures that each instance of the `hid` function has its own copy of the report descriptor.

3. The `hidg_desc_copy` is modified to set the correct descriptor type and length before being copied to the request buffer in the `USB_REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR` case.

4. The `hidg_bind` function is modified to clarify that the `hidg_desc` struct can be used, but its content should not be relied upon after returning from the function. This indicates that the `hidg_desc_copy` should be used instead.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with the static variable usage and provides a solution by introducing a local copy of the descriptor. It also clarifies the usage of the `hidg_desc` struct in the `hidg_bind` function. Therefore, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Additionally, it has received Acked-by tags from multiple contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to PML (Page Modification Logging) support in the VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions) module of KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine).
2. The patch fixes a problem where the guest would shut down if a PML full VMEXIT occurs during event delivery, which is not the expected behavior according to Intel SDM (Software Developer's Manual).
3. The patch modifies the vmx_handle_exit() function in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file.
4. It adds an additional condition to the if statement that checks the exit_reason. The new condition checks if the exit_reason is not EXIT_REASON_PML_FULL, which means that if a PML full VMEXIT occurs during event delivery, the code will not exit to user space with an error.
5. Instead of exiting with an error, the patch allows EXIT_REASON_PML_FULL to go through, and the event will be re-injected on the next VMENTRY.
6. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and a Cc to the stable mailing list, indicating that it is a fix for a stable release.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue it addresses and follows the necessary conventions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a problem where there is a small gap between the jack detection unsolicited event and the time the ELD (EDID-like Data) is updated. This can cause failures when user-space queries the HDMI ELD immediately after receiving the notification.

To mitigate this issue, the patch introduces a delay in the HDMI jack detect notification until the ELD information is fully updated. While the workaround is acknowledged as imperfect, it is considered sufficient as a starting point.

The patch modifies the `hdmi_present_sense` function to return a boolean value indicating whether the ELD information is fully updated. If the ELD is not fully updated, the function does not report the jack status to user-space. This ensures that user-space queries for HDMI ELD will not fail due to the timing gap.

Additionally, the patch includes a fix for AMD codecs that create ELD by themselves, bypassing the need for repolling.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to HDMI jack detection and ELD information, providing a workaround that improves the reliability of user-space queries. Therefore, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

   - The reproduction path demonstrates the issue and the resulting kernel crash.

2. Solution: The patch prevents null pointer dereference by checking if 'opts->id' is null before copying it to the 'page' buffer.
   - If 'opts->id' is null, it sets 'page[0]' to 0 (empty string) and returns 0.
   - This ensures that the function does not crash when 'opts->id' is not yet filled.

3. Impact: The patch fixes a potential crash and ensures that the 'f_midi_opts_id_show' function returns an empty string when 'opts->id' is null.
   - This prevents the kernel from crashing and provides a more robust behavior.

4. Code Quality: The patch is concise and follows the coding style of the Linux kernel.

Considering the above analysis, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch adds missing error codes and properly handles the error condition by setting the "err" variable to -ENOMEM (indicating out of memory error) and jumping to the "out" label.

3. The patch includes error handling for three different allocation scenarios: x->aalg, x->calg, and x->ealg. In each case, if the allocation fails, the "err" variable is set to -ENOMEM and the code jumps to the "out" label.

4. The patch also includes error handling for the allocation of x->encap. If the allocation fails, the "err" variable is set to -ENOMEM and the code jumps to the "out" label.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and adds proper error handling, ensuring that memory allocations are handled correctly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the usb_add_gadget_udc_release() function in the udc-core.c file. The purpose of the patch is to retry the gadget probe only if the probe result is -EPROBE_DEFER, rather than on every probe error.

The patch achieves this by adding a conditional statement that checks if the probe result is not -EPROBE_DEFER. If it is not, the driver is removed from the pending list using the list_del() function.

This change ensures that the driver is only retried if the probe result indicates a deferred probe, which is a more appropriate behavior. It improves the efficiency and reliability of the gadget probing process.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable and beneficial improvement to the Linux kernel code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the SYNC_LOST errors caused by the missing flag.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses two issues in the mISDNipac_irq function in the mISDN driver. 

1) The variable "cnt" starts as maxloop + 1, causing the loops to iterate one more time than intended. The patch fixes this by changing the loop condition to "--cnt" instead of "cnt--".

2) At the end of the loop, there is a check for "if (maxloop && !cnt)". However, for the first two loops, cnt ends up being -1, which doesn't satisfy the condition. The patch resolves this by changing the post-decrement operator to a pre-decrement operator, ensuring that cnt is set to 0 at the end of the loop.

These changes ensure that the loops iterate the correct number of times and that cnt is properly set to 0 at the end of the loop. The patch also includes the necessary Fixes and Signed-off-by tags.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issues and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the calculation of the inode alignment mask in xfs_set_inoalignment() is incorrect when the block size is larger than the inode cluster size. This is because the call to XFS_B_TO_FSBT() returns 0 in such cases, and the xfs_sb->sb_inoalignmt is set to 0 by mkfs.xfs.

The patch proposes using xfs_icluster_size_fsb() to calculate the inode alignment mask instead. This ensures that the correct value is used for mp->m_inoalign_mask.

The patch also mentions that xfs_imap() works fine even with mp->m_inoalign_mask having -1 as the value because blks_per_cluster variable would have the value 1. This means that there is no need to use mp->m_inoalign_mask to compute the inode chunk's agbno and offset within the chunk.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition between endpoint halt and URB cancellation in the xHCI (USB 3.0) host controller driver. The issue occurs when a user process tries to clear the halted state of an endpoint using CLEAR_HALT, but the stopped_td variable gets overwritten in the handle_stopped_endpoint() function. As a result, the xhci_endpoint_reset() function refuses to reset the endpoint, causing communication with the device to fail.

The patch fixes this issue by checking if the endpoint is halted before clearing the stopped_td and stopped_trb variables. If the endpoint is not halted, these variables are cleared, allowing communication to resume.

The patch includes a reference to a bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60699) and is signed-off by two contributors.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with ASIC revision 5762 when using TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload).
2. The patch introduces a new function `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` to detect TSO DMA buffers that cross into regions within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of any 4GB boundaries (4G, 8G, etc.).
3. The function `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` checks if the base address of the DMA buffer plus the length and the MSS value (masked to 14 bits) is less than the base address, indicating a potential buffer overflow.
4. The patch also modifies the `tg3_tx_frag_set` function to call `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` and set the `hwbug` flag if the test returns true.
5. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and a Cc to the stable mailing list, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and introduces a new function to detect and handle the problem. It appears to be well-implemented and has the necessary review and testing. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a call to the `omap_hsmmc_context_save()` function after enabling runtime power management (`pm_runtime_use_autosuspend()`). This ensures that register access in the context save API happens with the clock enabled. This change improves the reliability and correctness of the code.

2. The patch also sets the autosuspend delay and enables autosuspend for the host device. This is a standard practice for power management in MMC/SD host controllers.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author and maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only adds a necessary call to the context save function, which is a bug fix.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid bug fix that improves the stability and power management of the OMAP High-Speed MMC (omap_hsmmc) driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch also handles a scenario where cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value. It updates the value of s_cmd->insize to the new smaller value to prevent copying too much data to the user.

4. The patch includes the necessary metadata, such as the reported-by, fixes, signed-off-by, reviewed-by, and tested-by tags.

5. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Pengfei Wang, Dan Carpenter, Kees Cook, and Gwendal Grignou.

6. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases, as indicated by the "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" tag.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is well-documented, addresses a bug, and has undergone thorough review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an issue where a driver was printing an incorrect message due to a missing line that initializes a variable. The patch adds the missing line, resolving the issue.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an information leak issue in the AUDIT_GET request handling. The patch initializes the "mask" member of the "status_set" structure to zero, which prevents the leakage of 4 bytes of kernel stack.

Considering the nature of the fix and the potential security implications of an information leak, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality or regressions. Additionally, it has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including those responsible for the audit subsystem.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not take into account any specific requirements or policies of the Linux -stable release process.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in the block/blk-ioc.c file. The current implementation involves double lock dancing, which can be simplified by using trylock on the queue_lock and backing out from the ioc lock on trylock failure.

The changes made in the patch involve removing the last_q variable and replacing it with q. Instead of acquiring and releasing locks multiple times, the patch uses spin_trylock() to attempt acquiring the queue_lock. If successful, it calls ioc_exit_icq() and releases the lock. If not successful, it releases the ioc lock, performs a CPU relax, and then reacquires the ioc lock.

The patch simplifies the code by reducing the number of lock acquisitions and releases, making it more efficient and easier to understand.

Considering the patch's aim to simplify the code and the absence of any potential issues or regressions, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where event processing for the AP interface gets delayed or not processed after a sw scan, resulting in data halt and eventual disconnection. The patch ensures that work items are requeued for all VIF types (STA, ADHOC, MESH, and AP) after the scan is complete.

The patch modifies the following files:
- net/mac80211/ibss.c: Removes the requeueing of work items for ADHOC VIF types after the scan is complete.
- net/mac80211/mesh.c: Removes the function `ieee80211_mesh_notify_scan_completed` that requeues work items for MESH VIF types after the scan is complete.
- net/mac80211/mesh.h: Removes the declaration of `ieee80211_mesh_notify_scan_completed`.
- net/mac80211/mlme.c: Adds a loop to requeue work items for all VIF types after the scan is complete.

The changes in the patch ensure that work items are requeued for all VIF types, including AP, after the scan is complete. This prevents delays in event processing and potential data halt or disconnection on the AP interface.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided solution, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to improve the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. Further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers may be necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The variables `start_idx` and `end_idx` are declared as `int`, which can cause truncation of offsets larger than 1 << 44 (16TiB).
   - Impact: If `start` is below the boundary and `end` gets trimmed, the final check `if (page->index <= end_idx)` will unexpectedly fail, leading to a false return value of `false` from the function `btrfs_page_exists_in_range`.
   - Consequence: The function will incorrectly report that there are no pages in the range, even if there is at least one.
   - Use case: This function is used to prevent races in hole punching and lock_extent_direct operations.

2. Practical occurrence: The bug is unlikely to occur in practical scenarios, as it requires a large file, a range crossing the 16TiB boundary, and specific internal state conditions.

3. Fix: The patch corrects the issue by changing the types of `start_idx` and `end_idx` to `unsigned long`, ensuring that offsets larger than 1 << 44 are not trimmed.

4. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the bug and provides a fix for it.

Considering the impact, the fix provided, and the low likelihood of practical occurrence, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
