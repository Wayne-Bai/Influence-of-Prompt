false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check in the `nfs_compare_remount_data` function to reject remount attempts that change the NFS version or minor version.
   - This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific behavior related to remounting NFS filesystems.

2. The patch also adds the `data->version` and `data->minorversion` assignments in the `nfs_remount` function.
   - This assigns the NFS version and minor version from the `nfsvers` and `nfss->nfs_client->cl_minorversion` variables, respectively.

3. The patch includes the `Reported-by`, `Signed-off-by`, and `Reviewed-by` tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to remounting NFS filesystems. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: enable DMA for SDHI0"
   This patch aims to enable DMA for SDHI0 on the shmobile bockw board.

2. Patch content:
   - The patch adds two lines of code to the sdhi0_info structure in the board-bockw.c file.
   - The added lines specify the DMA slave IDs for the SDHI0 controller.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch enables DMA for the SDHI0 controller, which can improve performance and reduce CPU usage during data transfers.
   - Enabling DMA is generally considered a beneficial change, as it can enhance system efficiency.
   - The patch does not appear to fix any specific bug or address a critical issue.
   - It does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address a significant issue. It is more of an enhancement rather than a critical fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using variables. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch adjusts the chunk size for metadata on larger filesystems. While this change may optimize performance, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an obsoleted check in the ext4 file system code. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ath9k_hw_reset` function in the `ath9k/hw.c` file.

2. The change is made to the section where the `AR_OBS` register is programmed.

3. Previously, the `AR_OBS` register was always programmed with the value 8.

4. The patch adds a condition before programming the `AR_OBS` register. It checks if the MCI (Memory Controller Interface) is disabled using the `ath9k_hw_mci_is_enabled` function.

5. If the MCI is disabled, the `AR_OBS` register is programmed with the value 8.

6. If the MCI is enabled, the `AR_OBS` register is not programmed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a conditional programming of the `AR_OBS` register based on the MCI status. However, it is not clear from the provided information whether this change is fixing a real and critical bug or addressing an "oh, that's not good" issue.

To make a final determination, I would need more context about the bug or issue this patch is intended to fix. Without that information, I cannot confidently say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves replacing a single table with two different tables. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any significant improvements or necessary changes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding DT (Device Tree) defines for co-processor reset lines in the ARM STi platform. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a sparse warning in the `tuntap` driver. The change makes the `tun_enable_queue()` function static, which resolves the sparse warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes two unused fields from the autofs_sb_info structure. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to DMA on SoCs (System on Chips). The patch modifies the `dma_attach` function in the `brcmsmac` driver to add an offset for PCIe devices with DMA64 bus, but only when running on an SoC.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a specific fix related to DMA on SoCs, which may not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ath9k driver, specifically the ath_pci_aspm_init function. It replaces direct access to PCI configuration registers with PCI Express Capability access functions.

Based on the provided code, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code cleanup or optimization change.

Since the patch does not address a critical issue and contains a "trivial" fix (replacing direct register access with capability accessors), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a small inline wrapper for the `device_tx_status` callback of a DMA device. This change aims to make the code more compact and legible for users of this function.

However, since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "drm/i915/vlv: check port in infoframe_enabled v2"
   - The patch title suggests that it is related to the Intel i915 graphics driver for the Valley View (VLV) platform.

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off by Jesse Barnes, Rodrigo Vivi, and Daniel Vetter, indicating that multiple developers have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch modifies the function `vlv_infoframe_enabled` in the `intel_hdmi.c` file.
   - It adds a new variable `intel_dig_port` of type `struct intel_digital_port` and initializes it using `enc_to_dig_port(encoder)`.
   - It introduces a new variable `port` to store the port value from `intel_dig_port`.
   - It modifies the return statement to check if `port` matches the port value obtained from `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK` in the register `val`.
   - If the port matches, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `val` and `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE`. Otherwise, it returns false.

4. Analysis:
   - The patch appears to add a necessary check for the port value in the `vlv_infoframe_enabled` function.
   - It ensures that the function only returns true if the port matches the expected value and the `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE` flag is set.
   - This check helps prevent potential issues related to incorrect port configuration and enables proper handling of infoframes.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the handling of infoframes in the Intel i915 graphics driver for the VLV platform. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the file `net/sched/sch_generic.c` in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch adds a check for the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag in two places where the `dev->tx_queue_len` is checked.

3. In the first check, the patch adds `!(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE)` as an additional condition to enter the if statement. This means that if `dev->tx_queue_len` is non-zero and the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is not set, the code inside the if statement will be executed.

4. In the second check, the patch adds `dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE` as an additional condition to enter the if statement. This means that if `dev->tx_queue_len` is zero, or the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set, the code inside the if statement will be executed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary change to handle the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero. This change ensures that the appropriate default qdisc is attached to the network device based on the presence of the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that switches from using `module_init` and `module_exit` to `module_platform_driver` for the `gpio_ir_recv` driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant "break" statements after "goto" statements. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds error checking for the `dev_alloc_skb()` call in the `amsdu_to_msdu()` function. If the allocation fails, the patch breaks out of the loop, indicating a failure. This is a good practice to handle allocation failures.

2. The patch also adds error checking for the `skb_clone()` call in the `recvbuf2recvframe()` function. If the cloning fails, the patch returns `_FAIL`, indicating a failure. This ensures that the failure is properly handled.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues with unchecked allocations and adds proper error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that makes the function `hp_amp_power_on` static. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting to table-based control initialization. This change improves error handling and saves code. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character to the end of dev_err messages. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the networking subsystem in the Linux kernel, specifically the hns (HiSilicon Network Subsystem) driver. It introduces changes to use fwnode_handle instead of device_node for device matching and retrieval.

Based on the provided patch, it seems to be addressing a specific issue related to finding and handling the device node in the hns driver. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional details such as the bug description, impact, and severity. Without this information, it is not possible to definitively say whether this patch should be accepted or not.

Therefore, based solely on the provided patch content, I cannot make a conclusive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch switches over to the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. This is a good practice as it ensures the use of standardized and maintained functions.

2. The patch removes the TODO item related to the TMU clocksource. This indicates that the patch addresses a long-standing issue, which is a positive sign.

3. The patch replaces the calculation of shift, mult, max_delta_ns, and min_delta_ns with a call to clockevents_config(). This simplifies the code and makes it more maintainable.

4. The patch also updates the clockevents_register_device() call to clockevents_config_and_register(). This ensures that the clock event device is properly configured and registered.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the TMU clocksource and improves the code by using standardized functions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the existing event handler functions with the generic data ready poll function. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather performs a code cleanup, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized variable issue in the ath9k driver. The warning message suggests that the variable "npend" may be used uninitialized in the "ath9k_has_tx_pending" function.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to undefined behavior, it should be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves initializing the "npend" variable to 0.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new function `calibration_delay_done()` with a dummy implementation. This function is used to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and can be used by architectures to stop accepting delay timer registrations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "i2c: brcmstb: use new 8 bit address helper function". This suggests that it introduces a new helper function for handling 8-bit addresses in the i2c-brcmstb driver.

2. The patch has been reviewed by Andy Shevchenko and signed-off by Wolfram Sang, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

3. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the "brcmstb_i2c_do_addr" function in the "i2c-brcmstb.c" file.

4. In the original code, the address is calculated by shifting the "msg->addr" value by 1 and then checking if the "I2C_M_RD" flag is set to determine whether to set the LSB (least significant bit) of the address.

5. The patch replaces this calculation with a call to the "i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg" helper function, which presumably handles the address calculation in a more efficient and reliable manner.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a functional improvement to the i2c-brcmstb driver by using a new helper function for address calculation. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch can be considered as a "trivial" fix since it involves code cleanup and optimization.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused variable 'neigh' from the 'dn_output()' function in the 'dn_route.c' file of the DECnet subsystem. Since the variable is assigned but not used anywhere else in the function, removing it does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch would fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, specifically a whitespace cleanup, and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds support for VB2_DMABUF in the davinci vpbe driver.
   - This indicates that the patch is adding functionality to the driver.

2. The patch modifies the `q->io_modes` field in the `vpbe_display_probe` function.
   - It adds the `VB2_DMABUF` flag to the `q->io_modes` field.

3. The `VB2_DMABUF` flag enables support for exporting buffers as DMA-BUFs.
   - This allows other subsystems or drivers to share buffers with the davinci vpbe driver using DMA-BUF.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for exporting buffers as DMA-BUFs.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a manual swapping operation with the `swap()` macro defined in `kernel.h`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability and maintainability, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing superfluous address-of operators and unneeded casts. It also updates the printk format specifier to use %p for pointers.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), and it only contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the `ioctl` function with `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. This change is specific to the `radio-bcm2048` driver and does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the variable name `PIDVEC_SIZE` to `max_items` in the `f2fs` file system's `gang_lookup_pids` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a simple renaming of a variable, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change removes a condition that is always true after a previous check. Since it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is in line with the driver-core's recommendation to use synchronous self-deletion of attributes instead of the asynchronous removal mechanism.

2. The patch removes the `sdev_store_delete_callback()` function, which was previously used as a callback for `device_schedule_callback()`. This change simplifies the code by directly calling `scsi_remove_device()`.

3. The `sdev_store_delete()` function is modified to use `device_remove_file_self()` instead of `device_schedule_callback()`. If `device_remove_file_self()` succeeds, it directly calls `scsi_remove_device()`.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue and improves the code by using the recommended synchronous self-deletion mechanism. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial cleanup that removes an unnecessary forward declaration. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any functional issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or security enhancements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that introduces a local variable "handle" for economy of expression. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `platform_device_put` function call in the error path of `raumfeld_audio_init` function. This fix ensures that the platform device is properly released in case of an error during the `platform_device_add` call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for the McASPs on the davinci dm646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and are associated with specific IRQ numbers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

From the information provided, it seems that this patch is adding necessary interrupt resources for error recovery in the McASPs. While it may not directly fix a critical bug causing any of the mentioned issues, it is likely addressing a potential issue related to error recovery.

Considering this, the patch seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is fixing the optional DAPM route map parsing in the simple-card driver.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds an option to skip sync on DMA map in the arch/avr32 folder. It aims to ensure consistent behavior across all DMA APIs in the arch/arm folder.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `avr32_dma_map_page` and `avr32_dma_map_sg` functions in the `arch/avr32/mm/dma-coherent.c` file.

3. Code Changes:
   - In the `avr32_dma_map_page` function, a check is added to skip the `dma_cache_sync` call if the `DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC` attribute is set.
   - In the `avr32_dma_map_sg` function, a similar check is added to skip the `dma_cache_sync` call for specific scatterlist entries if the `DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC` attribute is set.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a consistency improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a calculation with the DIV_ROUND_UP macro. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a USB ID for the PCTV 340eSE device. This patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the name of a signal from "DE" to "DISP" in the rcar-du driver for the DRM subsystem. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the IRQ handler function to the i2c section. This change is not related to fixing a real and critical bug, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or addressing a security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes indentation in the `struct amdgpu_ring`, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a check of the status_code in the ERSP_IU structure in the nvme_fc_fcpio_done function in the fc.c file of the nvme host driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

From the patch, it seems that the check of the status_code is being added to the existing code. Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this change addresses a critical issue or a real security concern. However, the addition of this check suggests that it may be addressing an issue related to the status_code.

Considering the lack of information about the bug being fixed and the absence of any trivial fixes in the patch, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. More information about the bug and its impact would be required to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the private copy of `struct net_device_stats` in `struct port_info` and instead uses the stats from `struct net_device`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves removing a struct member and updating a pointer assignment.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ipmmu_probe` function in the `shmobile-ipmmu.c` file.

2. The patch removes the call to `ipmmu_iommu_init` and replaces it with a return statement that calls `ipmmu_iommu_init` and returns its value.

3. The `ipmmu_iommu_init` function initializes the IPMMU IOMMU and can potentially fail.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue by not ignoring the return value of `ipmmu_iommu_init`. This suggests that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to a failure in initializing the IPMMU IOMMU.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new parameter "rw" to the function "__extent_read_full_page" in "extent_io.c". This parameter is used to specify the type of IO operation (READ or WRITE). This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch modifies the function "extent_read_full_page" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change also seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

3. The patch modifies the function "write_one_eb" to set the "rw" parameter as "WRITE" or "WRITE_SYNC" depending on the value of "epd->sync_io". Additionally, it sets the "REQ_META" flag for metadata IO. This change seems to address a real issue related to metadata IO and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

4. The patch modifies the function "extent_readpages" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

5. The patch modifies the function "read_extent_buffer_pages" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" and the "REQ_META" flag when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses real issues related to metadata IO and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding initial support for the GP104 chipset in the Nouveau driver. However, the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial change as it only adds a single line to the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for distinguishing between i.MX23 and i.MX28 LRADC units in order to make the touchscreen work on i.MX23. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. It seems to be a specific fix for a particular hardware variant. 

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix default UVD context size". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the default UVD context size in the AMDGPU driver.

2. Looking at the code changes, we see that the variable "min_ctx_size" is initialized to the maximum possible value (~0) instead of 0. This variable is used to determine the minimum context size for UVD (Unified Video Decoder) operations.

3. The current code calculates the image size and adds it to the context size. However, the patch changes the initialization of "min_ctx_size" to ~0, which effectively sets it to the maximum possible value. This ensures that the correct minimum context size is calculated.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug related to the default UVD context size calculation in the AMDGPU driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential issue that could impact the functionality of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the ARM shmobile rcar-gen2 platform. It adds more register documentation and includes some changes to the register definitions and related code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch disables the centroid pixel performance optimization in the bdw driver.
   - It is a workaround for BDW Bug #1899532.
   - The v2 version adds a WARN when not using preliminary HW support.

2. Code Changes:

   - It writes the value of `GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS` to the `HALF_SLICE_CHICKEN3` register in `gen8_init_clock_gating()` function in `intel_pm.c`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific bug and provides a workaround for it.
   - It adds a new register definition and writes a value to it.
   - The WARN statement ensures that the patch is only applied when preliminary HW support is not used.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a specific bug and provides a necessary workaround. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the initialization of the 5/10MHz channel width on the ar9003 hardware in the ath9k driver. The patch moves the call to `ath9k_hw_set_rfmode()` after `ath9k_hw_process_ini()` to avoid overwriting the AR_PHY_MODE register with default values.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses an issue with channel width initialization on the ar9003 hardware, which can impact the functionality of the wireless driver.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a kernel warning related to suspicious RCU usage in the `net/sched/cls_tcindex.c` file.
2. The warning indicates that there is a suspicious `rcu_dereference_check()` usage at line 84 of `cls_tcindex.c`.
3. The patch modifies the `tcindex_classify()` function in `cls_tcindex.c`.
4. It replaces the `rcu_dereference()` call with `rcu_dereference_bh()` to fix the suspicious RCU usage.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to RCU usage and fixes a kernel warning. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the display of the "cache" option in /proc/mounts for CIFS filesystems. It also deprecates the display of "strictcache" and "directio" as separate options. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real issue related to firmware request failure in the imx-sdma driver. It adds error messages to differentiate between the cases when firmware cannot be requested from platform data and when it cannot be requested from the device tree.

The issue being fixed is not trivial and can potentially cause problems such as build errors, oops, or data corruption if the firmware is not properly loaded. Therefore, it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on improving error reporting and providing more specific error messages.

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and Acked by Sascha Hauer, which adds credibility to its importance and correctness.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel panic issue caused by a recursive recovery during boot. The patch checks the state of the wl->state variable before queuing a new recovery, ensuring that the hardware is not already stopped. This fix addresses a potential critical bug that could lead to a kernel panic.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` flag in the `ip_block_status` structure accordingly.

2. The `dce_v10_0_soft_reset` function is modified to check if the `hang` flag is set before performing a soft reset. If the display is not hung, the function returns without performing the reset.

3. The `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure is updated to include the new `check_soft_reset` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a check for display hang before performing a soft reset in the AMDGPU driver. This can help prevent unnecessary resets when the display is not actually hung, improving system stability.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that can cause hangs, it can be considered a fix for a "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. This change does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the HID Wacom driver. The patch moves the report header check for the Wacom Graphire device to ensure that valid reports are not filtered out.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to the Wacom Graphire device.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "staging: lustre: fix socklnd issues found by Klocwork Insight tool"
   This patch aims to fix issues in the socklnd module of the Lustre staging driver, which were identified by the Klocwork Insight tool.

2. Issue description: "Null pointer 'best_iface' that comes from line 802 may be dereferenced at line 832."
   The patch addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the code. It ensures that 'best_iface' is not null before dereferencing it.

3. Signed-off-by: Dmitry Eremin <dmitry.eremin@intel.com>
   The patch is signed off by Dmitry Eremin, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. Intel-bug-id: https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/browse/LU-4629
   The patch is associated with an Intel bug ID, which suggests that it addresses a specific issue reported by Intel.

5. Reviewed-by: John L. Hammond <john.hammond@intel.com>, Isaac Huang <he.huang@intel.com>, Oleg Drokin <oleg.drokin@intel.com>
   The patch has been reviewed and approved by multiple reviewers from Intel, indicating that it has undergone thorough scrutiny.

6. Code changes:
   - Line 804: A comment is added to indicate that the peer passive IPs are kept up to date.
   - Line 838: A comment is added to indicate that 'best_iface' should not be null.
   - Line 840: An assertion (LASSERT) is added to ensure that 'best_iface' is not null before dereferencing it.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue and has been reviewed and approved by multiple Intel reviewers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "gpio: tpic2810: Make tpic2810_direction_output set proper output level". This suggests that the patch aims to fix an issue related to the output level set by the tpic2810_direction_output function.

2. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by Axel Lin and Linus Walleij.

3. Looking at the code changes, we can see that a new static function called "tpic2810_set" is added. This function is called within the tpic2810_direction_output function to set the output level.

4. The tpic2810_direction_output function previously did not set the output level, but with this patch, it calls the tpic2810_set function to set the output level based on the provided value.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the proper output level in the tpic2810_direction_output function. Since this fix is not trivial and could potentially impact the behavior of the GPIO driver, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing unnecessary calls to `ipset_nest_end()` in the error paths of three different files (`ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`). 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it only involves removing trivial code, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the acpi_power_meter driver that causes the kernel to crash when it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. The current code uses the BUG() macro, which triggers a kernel panic and crashes the system. The proposed patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, which generates a warning message but allows the system to continue running.

The conditions that trigger the BUG() macro suggest that there is a bug in the code, but they are not fatal. By replacing the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, the patch ensures that the kernel does not crash unnecessarily and allows the system to handle the unexpected conditions gracefully.

The patch also includes additional error handling for unexpected attribute indexes in the show_val() and show_str() functions. Instead of triggering a BUG(), the patch uses the WARN() macro to generate a warning message and returns a default value.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause the kernel to crash unnecessarily. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses an issue that can potentially lead to system instability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to make virtual_lun0 a nullio device.
   - This change suggests that virtual_lun0 should not be used for reading or writing.
   - It does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue.

2. The patch is signed-off by Andy Grover and Nicholas Bellinger.
   - The sign-off indicates that the authors have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. In the code changes:
   - Line 1544: The buffer `buf` is modified to initialize it with the value "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1".
   - Line 1557: The line that clears the buffer and sets it to "rd_pages=8" is removed.
   - Line 1558: The new value of `buf` is passed to `set_configfs_dev_params` function.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. It appears to be a configuration change for virtual_lun0. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant assignment for the "gpio->da9052" variable in the "da9052_gpio_probe" function.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only staticizes some symbols in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The purpose of this change is to silence warnings about undeclared symbols.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch contains trivial changes that do not impact the functionality or stability of the kernel.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for setting a plane's rotation property from userspace in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch Title: staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite
   - The patch title suggests that it is related to the staging driver for Lustre filesystem.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description states that file times should only be updated if page_mkwrite is not set.
   - It mentions that file_update_time needs to be called manually in this case.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including James Simmons and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change adds a call to file_update_time before the do-while loop in the ll_page_mkwrite function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a fix for a specific issue related to the Lustre filesystem staging driver. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, additional information such as the severity of the bug, the impact on system stability, and whether it addresses a critical issue like a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security vulnerability would be necessary.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the declaration of two arrays, `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs`, to be declared as `const struct pxa_freqs`. This change indicates that these arrays are only read and not modified, which improves code clarity and potentially allows for compiler optimizations.

2. The patch also updates the `find_freq_tables()` function and its callsites to use `const struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs` instead of `struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs`. This change ensures that the `pxa_freqs` pointer is not used to modify the underlying data, which is consistent with the intention of the function.

3. Additionally, the patch updates the `pxa_cpufreq_change_voltage()` function to use `const struct pxa_freqs *pxa_freq` instead of `struct pxa_freqs *pxa_freq`. This change indicates that the function does not modify the `pxa_freq` data, improving code clarity and potentially allowing for compiler optimizations.

4. The patch also updates the `pxa_cpufreq_init()` function to use `const struct pxa_freqs *pxa255_freqs` instead of `struct pxa_freqs *pxa255_freqs`. This change indicates that the `pxa255_freqs` data is not modified within the function, improving code clarity and potentially allowing for compiler optimizations.

Overall, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses the use of const correctness, which improves code clarity and potentially allows for compiler optimizations. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros, which expand to the I2C read and write addresses, respectively. These macros are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

2. The patch replaces the macro expansion with the actual code in place.

3. The patch is signed-off by Ian Abbott and reviewed by H Hartley Sweeten.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a trivial fix that removes unnecessary macros and expands them in place. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the enqueue_task function calls in multiple places. This flag is added to the existing ENQUEUE_RESTORE flag.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the change.

Given these factors, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, if there is additional information or context that suggests this patch addresses a critical issue, it would be necessary to review that information before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver, allowing the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name. This change is important as clocks can be named differently on multiple platforms.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi and Roger Quadros. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has received approval from experts in the field.

The changes made in the patch involve modifying clock names used in the driver. These changes are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they address the issue of clock naming inconsistency, which can potentially cause build errors or other critical issues.

The patch also includes additional error handling and warning messages to handle cases where the clock names cannot be obtained. This improves the robustness of the driver and provides helpful information for debugging and fixing the device tree.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to clock naming and improves the stability and reliability of the driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch introduces a new callback function called `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio-pca953x` driver. This function is responsible for retrieving the direction of a GPIO pin. It uses the `pca953x_read_single()` function to read the register value and returns the direction of the specified GPIO pin.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the initcall_sync variants in init.h to fix build errors. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not mention any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements:
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint PCH
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint LP PCH

2. The purpose of these WARN_ON statements is to generate a warning message if the condition is not met. In this case, the condition is checking whether the detected PCH is paired with an ULT CPU.

3. The WARN_ON statements indicate that if the condition is not met, it is considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a potential issue related to the pairing of LynxPoint PCH and LynxPoint LP PCH with ULT CPUs. It is not a trivial fix as it adds warnings for a critical condition that could lead to unexpected behavior or system instability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue that could potentially cause system problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the conditional logic to check for an error code instead of a success code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple change in logging mechanism.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and alignment. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and does not fix any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function in the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset. The function `s_vGetFreeContext` is renamed to `vnt_get_free_context`. 

Since this patch only involves a function name change and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash due to a null dereference and adds error handling for a failed kzalloc allocation. This patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to a crash, making it a candidate for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "ASoC: ak4642: fixup channels_min" and it appears to address a channel mismatch issue in the ak4642 codec driver. The patch modifies the minimum number of channels for both playback and capture streams from 1 to 2.

From the patch description, it seems that the ak4642 codec does not support Mono record, while the ak4643 codec does. This patch aims to fix the channel mismatch by setting the minimum number of channels to 2 for both playback and capture streams.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a channel mismatch, which is not explicitly mentioned as a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the ethtool API usage in the virtio_net driver. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch replaces the usage of smp_mb() with smp_store_mb/release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin/end() functions in arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c.

2. Code Changes: The patch replaces the smp_mb() call with smp_store_mb() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() function and replaces the smp_mb() call with smp_store_release() in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() function.

3. Purpose: The purpose of these changes is to ensure proper memory ordering and synchronization between the write to vcpu->mode and subsequent reads in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() and walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() functions.

4. Impact: The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a performance optimization to improve memory ordering and synchronization.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address a real issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the `perf report` command in the Linux kernel. It adds information about an optional `print_limit` argument for the `--call-graph` option.

Since this patch only affects the documentation and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug related to the deletion of queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch uses the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues. This change ensures that the controller returns an invalid queue identifier error to commands if a queue wasn't created.

3. The patch has been reported by Saar Gross and signed-off by Keith Busch.

4. The patch has also been reviewed by Christoph Hellwig and signed-off by Jens Axboe.

5. The code changes in the patch involve modifying the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function.

6. The variable `queues` is introduced to store the value of `dev->online_queues - 1`.

7. The loop in the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function iterates twice, with `pass` being the loop counter.

8. The variable `sent` is initialized to 0, and `i` is initialized to `queues`.

9. The `reinit_completion` function is called to reset the completion object `dev->ioq_wait`.

10. The `retry` label indicates a retry point in the code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to queue deletion in the NVMe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that converts the blackfin driver to use the 64-bit get/set time methods. This change is necessary to ensure that the driver is ready for the year 2038, as it mentions the use of a 64-bit nanoseconds register.

Since this patch addresses a critical issue related to time handling and ensures future compatibility, it can be considered as fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new macro called VA_START to replace the lengthy expression (UL(0xffffffffffffffff) << VA_BITS) used in multiple places. The purpose of this macro is to define the first kernel virtual address.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that simplifies the code by introducing a new macro.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the bcm-kona GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` which is called when an IRQ is started. This function locks the hardware IRQ and checks if it was successfully locked. If not, it logs an error message.

2. The patch also adds a new function `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown` which is called when an IRQ is shut down. This function masks the IRQ and unlocks the hardware IRQ.

3. The `bcm_gpio_irq_chip` structure is updated to include the new `irq_startup` and `irq_shutdown` function pointers.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to locking and unlocking hardware IRQs in the bcm-kona GPIO driver. It does not introduce any trivial changes and appears to be a critical fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call initializes the "icount" structure to zero, but since the structure is allocated using kzalloc, it is already zeroed out. Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the soc_camera driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for reading from the video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix, so it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

2. The patch also adds a debug line, which is not a critical issue but can be useful for debugging purposes. However, it is considered a trivial change and does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

3. The patch checks if the camera bus driver supports the "init_videobuf2" operation and if the video device can be read in VB2_READ mode. If both conditions are met, it calls the "vb2_read" function to read from the video device. This is a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix.

4. If the camera bus driver does not support reading or the conditions are not met, the patch returns an error code (-EINVAL) and prints an error message. This is not a critical bug, but rather a limitation of the driver.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also contains trivial changes in the form of a debug line. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() in the rcutorture test. This change aims to test the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not fix a bug or address an issue in the Linux kernel itself. Instead, it modifies the rcutorture test to include interrupt disabling during the call_rcu() invocation. While this change may be useful for testing purposes, it does not fix a real bug or address a critical issue in the kernel.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a compile issue with a variable not being initialized in the obd_mount.c file of the Lustre staging driver. 

Since this patch addresses a build error, it can be considered a real and critical bug. However, it does not seem to cause any oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, it may not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check that is not doing anything useful. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the spi-armada-3700 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the removal of the ".owner" field.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add a handler function for the Periodic Inquiry command complete event in the Bluetooth subsystem. However, without further details about the bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine its significance or criticality.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix. Specifically, I would need to know if the bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Once I have more information, I can provide a more accurate assessment of whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to make the OVSP_LOCAL constant in the openvswitch.h header file a 32-bit value instead of a 16-bit value. The justification for this change is that OVS ports are now 32-bit, so OVSP_LOCAL should also be 32-bit.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix that changes the size of a constant value.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless initialization of the variable 'ret'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ath9k wireless driver and specifically updates the AR9485 initvals. The change made is modifying the values at memory addresses 0x00009e3c and 0x0000a2c4.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear what specific issue this patch is addressing. The patch description mentions a failure in HW peak detect calibration for AR9300 chips and the decision to implement a software-based solution instead. However, it does not provide any details about the impact or severity of the issue.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the changes made in this patch seem to be related to specific hardware and may not have a broad impact on all systems.

Therefore, based on the available information, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further investigation and clarification regarding the issue and its severity would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a kmalloc() call with kzalloc(). However, the patch also removes two memset() calls that were previously used to zero out memory. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it contains trivial changes (removing memset()), I would classify it as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: OMAPDSS: HDMI: Handle panel init error at probe
   - The patch title suggests that it addresses an issue related to handling panel initialization errors during probe.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description mentions that the assumption of successful panel initialization should not be made blindly.
   - It also states that the mutex initialization for the hdmi.ip_data.lock should be grouped at a single place.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 60: Adds a new member "struct mutex lock" to the existing struct.
   - Line 1056: Initializes the newly added mutex "hdmi.ip_data.lock".
   - Line 1083: Calls the function "hdmi_panel_init()" and checks its return value.
   - Line 1094: Adds an error handling code block in case "hdmi_panel_init()" fails.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a critical issue related to handling panel initialization errors during probe. It also improves the code by grouping mutex initialization at a single place. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the Intel graphics driver. It includes changes to the initialization and cleanup of plane state for the Intel display.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to address some issues related to plane state management. Specifically, it updates the plane state during initialization and also clears the plane state during cleanup.

The changes made in the patch do not seem to fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, they appear to be related to improving the accuracy of the plane_mask and updating the plane state during initialization and cleanup.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch could be considered as relatively trivial fixes.

Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve moving some functions from the codec driver to the component driver, which does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that modifies the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions of the `net/mac802154/iface.c` file.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the use of WARN_ON() in the srpt_abort_cmd() function in the ib_srpt.c file.

2. The current code uses WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state"), which is not the recommended usage of WARN_ON(). While it will work, the intent is not obvious.

3. The patch replaces the existing WARN_ON() with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state). This change makes the warning more useful by showing the "state" value.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue by improving the clarity and usefulness of the warning message. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential bug that could lead to unexpected command states. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the __must_check attribute to the declarations of two functions in the dvb-usb driver. This attribute is used to indicate that the return value of the function must be checked by the caller.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces deprecated operations with their recommended counterparts. The patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix a bit toggling issue in the ixgbe driver for the 82599 network card. The current code does not toggle the correct bit to reset the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, including Don Skidmore, Phil Schmitt, Aaron Brown, and David S. Miller.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the ixgbe_reset_pipeline_82599 function in the ixgbe_82599.c file. Specifically, it updates the AUTOC register by toggling the LMS[2] bit and Restart_AN.

4. Analysis: The patch appears to address a specific issue related to resetting the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion for the 82599 network card. It modifies the AUTOC register by toggling the correct bit using the XOR operator.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the 82599 network card. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error when the PM_SLEEP is disabled. It addresses a functional definition issue in the "tegra_pm_validate_suspend_mode" function, preventing a multiple definition error.

However, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial fix related to build errors and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the assignment of the current task's state in the ipc/sem.c file. This change replaces the direct assignment with a call to the __set_current_state() helper function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a compile-time check for the size of the struct bt_skb_cb within the limits of skb->cb. This check ensures that the size of the struct does not exceed the size of skb->cb.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a module option called "nested" to the kvm_intel module. This option controls whether the guest can use VMX instructions, enabling or disabling nested virtualization. 

The patch also includes a new function called "nested_vmx_allowed" that checks whether a guest should be allowed to use VMX instructions and MSRs (nested VMX). This function checks if the "nested" module option is enabled and if the guest's CPU supports VMX instructions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new feature to control nested virtualization.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "perf probe: Free perf_probe_event in cleanup_perf_probe_events()". It suggests that the patch aims to free resources related to a perf probe event in the cleanup_perf_probe_events() function.

2. The patch description states that the cleanup_perf_probe_events() function currently only frees resources in trace probe events and not in perf probe events. The patch proposes calling the clear_perf_probe_event() function to free resources related to perf probe events as well.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Wang Nan <wangnan0@huawei.com>.

4. The patch is signed-off by Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a necessary change to add the "dma_dir" parameter to the alloc memop in the vb2_queue_cancel function. This change is required for the next patch that needs to know the dma_dir for the dma-sg alloc memop.

The patch modifies multiple files, including videobuf2-core.c, videobuf2-dma-contig.c, videobuf2-dma-sg.c, and videobuf2-vmalloc.c. It introduces the "dma_dir" parameter to the vb2_dc_alloc, vb2_dma_sg_alloc, and vb2_vmalloc_alloc functions in these files.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds some informational print statements to the simplefb driver. The added code does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix that includes spelling changes and informational print statements. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unnecessary call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The patch mentions that the IRQ is allocated with `devm_request_irq`, indicating that the IRQ is managed by the device model and does not need to be explicitly freed.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an issue related to unnecessary freeing of an IRQ, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a non-trivial issue and does not introduce any unnecessary changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect checks of power state bits in the ALSA VIA driver. The patch correctly handles the AC_VERB_GET_POWER_STATE value by shifting and masking it properly before comparing it with the target value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect power state checks. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add variable resolution support to the gspca driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the ability for subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions, which suggests that it introduces new functionality related to resolution handling.

2. The try_fmt function is called when setting the video format, and it allows subdrivers to modify the format parameters. This indicates that the patch enables subdrivers to customize the format settings based on their specific requirements.

3. The enum_framesizes function is called when enumerating the available frame sizes. If provided by the subdriver, it allows customization of the frame size enumeration process.

4. The patch modifies the vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function to handle the case when try_fmt is available. It sets the pixfmt based on the modified format parameters if try_fmt is present; otherwise, it uses the existing behavior.

5. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function is modified to call the subdriver's enum_framesizes function if available. This allows the subdriver to customize the frame size enumeration process.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch introduces new functionality to the gspca driver, enabling subdrivers to customize the format settings and frame size enumeration. While it does not explicitly fix a critical bug or address a security issue, it does enhance the driver's capabilities.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it introduces new functionality, which may not be appropriate for a stable release.

Therefore, the decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a checkpatch.pl warning about a line being over 80 characters. This type of fix falls under the category of "trivial" and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming an enum. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change that improves the display of vendor information for imported USB devices.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices. The patch adds a new rate_update hook and modifies the rs_rate_init function to re-initialize the rate scaling when a remote station changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

From the patch description and code changes, it seems that this patch addresses a specific behavior related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver. While it may improve the behavior and performance of the driver, it does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves removing redundant code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the HDMI PLL reset. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the `reconnect_one()` function by replacing the `lookup_one_len()` function with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. This change suggests that the patch aims to improve the locking mechanism during the lookup process.

2. The patch introduces a comment explaining the logic when the lookup yields a different dentry. It states that if the `tmp` dentry is not equal to the original `dentry`, it means that someone has renamed it since `exportfs_get_name()`. The comment further explains that this scenario is acceptable because the dentry could only have been renamed if it was looked up and connected, and it would remain connected afterwards.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific scenario where a dentry could be renamed during the lookup process. While the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does fix a potential issue related to dentry renaming.

Considering the provided criteria, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch appear to be more of an optimization rather than a fix for a real and critical problem.

Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the physical address information to the vm_struct for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, this patch seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only adds a member to a structure.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix potential issues related to NULL pointer handling in the bcm2835-audio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch replaces NULL return values from `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it provides more specific information about the failure reason. The error pointer values returned are `-EINVAL` for too many instances of audio service, `-ENOMEM` for kzalloc failure, and `-EPERM` for vchi connections failure to open.

2. The patch also replaces a NULL check with `IS_ERR(..)` where `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is called. This change ensures that the error pointer values are properly handled.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues related to NULL pointer handling and improves error reporting in the bcm2835-audio driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be removing the unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

Since this patch is removing unused code and does not fix any real or critical bugs, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the way the DRM_MINOR_* constants are defined. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "s390/vmur: Link parent CCW device during UR device creation." It suggests a modification to the code related to the creation of virtual unit record (UR) devices on the s390 architecture.

2. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the code in the ur_set_online function in the vmur.c file. Specifically, it changes the device_create function call by adding the parent CCW device as the second argument.

3. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it is not mentioned if the patch contains any trivial fixes.

4.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command in the Linux kernel. This option allows for explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. The patch also includes changes to the "perf" tool's documentation and related code files.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, let's check if the patch fixes a real and critical bug. The patch description does not mention any bug or issue being fixed explicitly. Instead, it introduces a new feature or enhancement to the "perf record" command. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of fixing a bug.

Next, let's consider if the patch addresses a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Again, the patch description does not indicate any of these issues being addressed. It seems to be a functional enhancement rather than a fix for any critical issue.

Lastly, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Although the patch does modify code files and documentation, it does not appear to include any trivial changes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept the patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the dm_thin_find_block() function in the dm-thin-metadata.c file. The race condition occurs when checking the fail_io flag outside the metadata device's root_lock, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not mention any of these issues explicitly.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add debug error messages to report command timeout in the liquidio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a timeout error message in the function `lio_process_ordered_list()` in the liquidio driver. This indicates that there is a potential issue with command timeouts in the driver.

2. It also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the function `if_cfg_callback()`. This provides additional information about the failure status when the NIC configuration instruction fails.

3. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes are made in the file `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c` and `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/response_manager.c`, which are relevant to the liquidio driver.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to command timeouts and provides additional error reporting. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant use of the of_match_ptr() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming variables and converting enums into defines. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a constify patch, which means it is making the of_device_id arrays const. This change is in line with the requirement of not containing any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

The patch itself is modifying three different files: mxc_w1.c, omap_hdq.c, and w1-gpio.c. In each file, the of_device_id array is being changed from non-const to const.

Since this patch is not fixing any real and critical bugs, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: "drm/i915/skl: Allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP"
   - The patch aims to allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP in the drm/i915/skl driver.

2. Reviewed-by: Rodrigo Vivi <rodrigo.vivi@intel.com>
   - The patch has been reviewed by Rodrigo Vivi, an Intel employee.

3. Signed-off-by: Damien Lespiau <damien.lespiau@intel.com>
   - The patch has been signed off by Damien Lespiau, an Intel employee.

4. Signed-off-by: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>, drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_uncore.c
   - The patch has been signed off by Daniel Vetter, mentioning the specific file where the changes are made.

5. Code Changes:
   - Line 968: The whitelist entry for RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE) is modified.
     - Before: { RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE), 8, GEN_RANGE(4, 8) }
     - After: { RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE), 8, GEN_RANGE(4, 9) }
   - The gen_bitmask range is extended from 4-8 to 4-9.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a targeted fix for the drm/i915/skl driver. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or a significant issue.

To make a final decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue this patch aims to fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function `nouveau_abi16` which is a locked variant of `nouveau_abi16_get`. This suggests that the patch is addressing a critical bug or issue related to accessing ABI16 data.

2. The patch modifies the existing `nouveau_abi16_get` function to use the new `nouveau_abi16` function. This change ensures that the client mutex is properly locked before accessing the ABI16 data.

3. The patch also adds a check in the `nouveau_abi16_get` function to verify if the ABI16 data is already available. If it is, the function returns the existing data without acquiring the mutex again. This optimization can improve performance.

4. The patch includes the necessary locking and unlocking of the client mutex, ensuring thread-safety when accessing the ABI16 data.

Based on the above analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to accessing ABI16 data in a thread-safe manner. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only changes the way the channel is set in the atusb_channel() function, replacing a call to atusb_write_reg() with atusb_write_subreg(). This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the behavior or functionality of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing helper function `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to obtain the block size of an ahash algorithm. This does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the `fib_table_lookup` function in the `net/ipv4/fib_trie.c` file. It changes the calculation of the `mp` variable, which is used later in the code.

The patch includes a comment stating that `fls(x) = __fls(x) + 1`. This comment suggests that using `__fls()` instead of `fls()` would be faster, assuming the argument `x` is non-null.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate this patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug?
   - No, the patch does not address a bug explicitly. It appears to be an optimization.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   - No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue?
   - No, the patch does not address a security issue.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - No, the patch does not address any problematic behavior.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the mx2-emmaprp driver. The patch adds the missing mutex_destroy() calls when the driver is removed, ensuring that the mutexes are properly cleaned up.

Since this patch fixes a potential resource leak and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. The patch clears the link status when the interface is down, preventing the driver from issuing a get statistics command when the interface is not operational.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue by preventing the driver from attempting to retrieve statistics when the interface is down.

Given that the patch does not fix a critical bug and contains a relatively trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes socket-specific code from l2cap_core.c. This change seems to be a cleanup or refactoring rather than fixing a critical bug or issue. Therefore, it can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be included in a stable release. 

2. The patch moves the check for backlog size to l2cap_sock.c. This change seems to be a code reorganization and does not fix any critical bug or issue. Similar to the previous change, it can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be included in a stable release.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the function signature of `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the `ceph_osdc_build_request()` function call to a different location within the code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Gemini Lake platform to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake platform by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the `intel_pstate_cpu_ids` array.

2. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be adding support for a new platform, which does not fall under the critical bug category.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new advertising setting in the Bluetooth subsystem. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch extends the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Olli Salonen and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the `frequency_min` value in the `si2157_ops` structure from 110000000 to 55000000.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is extending the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. This change does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes the '0x' notation when using the %pad format. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes forward declarations of the "struct super_block" in multiple files. Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial forward declarations, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills for the ARM64 architecture. This patch does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is related to ext4 crypto policies and their application on directories.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

3. The patch modifies the function `ext4_process_policy` in the file `fs/ext4/crypto_policy.c`.

4. The added code checks if the inode is a directory before applying the encryption policy. If the inode is not a directory, it returns an error (-EINVAL).

5. The patch also checks if the inode has an encryption context. If it doesn't, it further checks if the directory is empty. If the directory is not empty, it returns an error (-ENOTEMPTY). Otherwise, it creates an encryption context from the policy.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue where encryption policies were being applied to non-directory inodes. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The patch adds a necessary check to ensure that policies are only applied to directories.

Considering that this patch fixes a real issue that could potentially cause data corruption or security vulnerabilities, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "ARM: mxc: audmux-v2: add clk_prepare/clk_unprepare" and states that it is for migrating to the generic clk framework API.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Richard Zhao and Sascha Hauer.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the audmux_read_file() and mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port() functions in the arch/arm/plat-mxc/audmux-v2.c file.

4. Changes in audmux_read_file(): The patch replaces the calls to clk_enable() and clk_disable() with clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare() respectively. This change ensures that the clock is properly prepared before enabling it and properly disabled after use.

5. Changes in mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port(): Similar to audmux_read_file(), the patch replaces the calls to clk_enable() and clk_disable() with clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare() respectively. This ensures proper clock handling during port configuration.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is a migration to the generic clk framework API and introduces necessary changes to ensure proper clock handling. However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch can be considered as "trivial" fixes since they involve replacing one set of function calls with another.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a local variable and using a helper function to validate trigger arguments. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for a special WHEA _OSC call to turn on APEI firmware first mode explicitly on some machines. This is necessary to ensure there is a GHES hardware error record for hardware error notification.

2. The patch includes the necessary code in the `apei_osc_setup()` function to perform the WHEA _OSC call and enable APEI firmware first mode.

3. The `apei_osc_setup()` function retrieves the ACPI handle and runs the WHEA _OSC call using the provided context. If the call fails, it returns -EIO. Otherwise, it frees the allocated memory and returns 0.

4. The `apei_osc_setup()` function is exported as a symbol using `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`.

5. In the `ghes_init()` function in `ghes.c`, the `apei_osc_setup()` function is called to enable APEI firmware first mode. Depending on the return value and the value of `osc_sb_apei_support_acked`, different informational messages are printed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds necessary functionality to enable APEI firmware first mode on certain machines. This is important for proper hardware error notification. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for increasing the scan timeout in the iwlwifi driver. The change increases the timeout from 7 seconds to 15 seconds to avoid aborting a scan that may take longer than expected.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to scan timeouts, it can be considered a critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace modifications. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK hack in the Linux kernel's scheduler. The patch introduces a new attribute, attr::sched_flags, to properly handle the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.

Analyzing the patch, it seems to address a real issue related to the handling of the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag. This flag ensures that a process is reverted back to the SCHED_NORMAL policy on fork. The patch replaces the use of high bits nonsense with the new attr::sched_flags field, making the code more maintainable and readable.

The patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" situation, as it improves the handling of the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug and can be considered a relatively trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch itself does not include any specific changes or fixes related to critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be adding a new variable "neg_one" to the sysctl.c file, which is mentioned to be used by a subsequent patch.

Without further context or information about the subsequent patch that will utilize this new variable, it is difficult to determine the significance or impact of this change. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in a stable release until more information is provided about its purpose and the associated critical bug or issue it addresses.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a conversion from the legacy SKB paged frag API to the newer SKB frag API. This type of patch typically falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves code cleanup and does not address any real or critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only renames a function. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch seem to be related to fixing erroneous defines and adding new defines for reset pin controls.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the shmobile_init_delay() function in the ARM shmobile platform. The bug is related to device node reference leakage caused by the use of of_find_compatible_node() function, which returns a new reference to the found node without releasing the previous reference.

The patch proposes a solution by simplifying the code and replacing the of_find_compatible_node() calls with of_device_is_compatible(). This change reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(1) by moving the CPU identification logic inside the loop over cpu nodes.

The patch also includes proper handling of device node references by using of_node_put() to release the references obtained from of_find_node_by_path() and for_each_child_of_node().

The bug fixed by this patch does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. However, it addresses a real issue related to device node reference leakage, which can lead to resource leaks and potential instability in the system.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed solution, I believe this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to modify the cache push and clear code for the ColdFire architecture with MMU enabled. The patch includes changes to flush the branch cache on the write-through cache setup of the ColdFire V4e with MMU enabled.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a performance optimization for a specific architecture.

2. The patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a targeted improvement rather than fixing a critical problem.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It does not meet the criteria for inclusion as it does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: "usb: gadget: net2280: reset sequence number on ep enable"
   - The patch aims to reset the sequence number on endpoint enable to stay in sync with the host.

2. Patch description:
   - It mentions that the sequence number can be out of sync if the endpoint is disabled after some data transfers and enabled again.
   - The patch proposes to reset the sequence number to ensure synchronization with the host.

3. Tested-by: Ricardo Ribalda Delgado <ricardo.ribalda@gmail.com>
   - The patch has been tested by Ricardo Ribalda Delgado.

4. Signed-off-by: Mian Yousaf Kaukab <yousaf.kaukab@intel.com>
   - The patch is signed-off by Mian Yousaf Kaukab.

5. Signed-off-by: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>, drivers/usb/gadget/udc/net2280.c
   - The patch is also signed-off by Felipe Balbi, specifying the affected file.

6. Code changes:
   - The patch adds a new function `ep_clear_seqnum` to clear the sequence number.
   - In the `net2280_enable` function, the `ep_clear_seqnum` function is called if the device has the `PLX_SUPERSPEED` quirk.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real issue related to sequence number synchronization between the endpoint and the host. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply migrates the jazz driver to a new 'set-state' interface provided by the clockevents core, without providing any set-state callbacks.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves a migration to a new interface without any functional changes, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a code cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rt2x00: rt2800pci: fix AUX_CTRL register setup for RT3090/3390/3593/5592". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for specific RT2X00 wireless chips.

2. The patch references the functions "rt28xx_init" in "common/rtmp_init_intf.c" and "RTMPInitPCIeLinkCtrlValue" in "os/linux/rt_rbus_pci_drv.c". These references indicate that the patch is modifying the initialization process of the rt2800pci driver.

3. The patch modifies the "rt2800pci_init_registers" function in "drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2800pci.c". Specifically, it adds additional conditions to enable PCIe wakeup for certain RT2X00 wireless chips (RT3090, RT3390, RT3572, RT3593, RT5390, RT5392, and RT5592) if the device is using PCIe.

4. The changes made in the patch involve reading the current value of the AUX_CTRL register, setting specific fields related to PCIe wakeup, and writing the modified value back to the register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for certain RT2X00 wireless chips when using PCIe. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the initialization process and adding conditions for specific chipsets.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to register setup and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change made in the patch is to fix an off-by-one error in the loop condition, which avoids a delay in the final iteration of the loop.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by replacing "if (foo == false)" with "if (!foo)". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change and whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `freezable_schedule_timeout_killable()` function in the PM/Freezer subsystem. The patch correctly modifies the function to return the value from `schedule_timeout_killable()` instead of `freezer_count()`. 

Since the current callers of this function ignore the return code, the bug is considered harmless. However, the patch is still worth applying to ensure correctness and maintain consistency.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. The patch adds warnings for unresolved control methods in the ACPICA disassembler. This is important because unresolved control methods indicate that the disassembler was unable to determine the number of arguments to parse for the method invocation.

The patch also includes changes to several files, such as acglobal.h, aclocal.h, and utglobal.c, to add necessary variables and structures for tracking resolved external methods.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical issue related to unresolved control methods, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for 1080p capture at 2 fps and 5 fps to webcam emulation in the vivid driver. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is modifying the return parameters of the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management code. It ensures that the same address type passed to the command is also returned in the response message.

While this patch improves consistency, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively minor and do not seem to have a significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unreachable code. The only change made is the removal of the pr_debug() statement, which is indicated to never be executed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "staging: vt6655: Fix issue of byPacketType is not set at all."
   - This indicates that there is a bug related to the variable "byPacketType" not being set properly.

2. Changes made in the patch:
   - Line 342: Adds the line "pDevice->byPacketType = CARDbyGetPktType(pDevice);" to set the value of "byPacketType" using the function "CARDbyGetPktType(pDevice)".
   - Line 876: Changes the condition from "(pDevice->wBasicRate)" to "(pDevice->basic_rates)".

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific bug related to the variable "byPacketType" not being set properly.
   - The fix sets the value of "byPacketType" using the function "CARDbyGetPktType(pDevice)".
   - The change in line 876 updates the condition to check the "basic_rates" variable instead of "wBasicRate".

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a specific bug related to the "byPacketType" variable and updates the condition to check the correct variable. However, without further context or information about the bug and its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch introduces a new helper function called `sk_stream_is_writeable()` which is used to replace a hardcoded condition in several call sites. The purpose of this change is to accommodate the upcoming support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will modify the condition for TCP sockets.

The patch itself does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue related to writeability of sockets, which can have implications on the overall stability and performance of the system.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `cancel_delayed_work()` and `cancel_work_sync()` with `cancel_delayed_work_sync()`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the DRM/i915 driver. Additionally, there is a small refactoring for gen2 using the for_each_pipe macro. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch does not explicitly mention fixing a bug, but it adds support for CRC interrupts, which can help in detecting and fixing potential issues related to data corruption. So, it can be considered as addressing a potential issue.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption. It also does not address any security issues explicitly. However, the addition of CRC interrupts can help in detecting and preventing potential data corruption issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It adds functionality related to CRC interrupts and includes a small refactoring using the for_each_pipe macro.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it adds important functionality related to CRC interrupts and does not introduce any trivial changes. However, it is always recommended to have a thorough review and testing process before including any patch in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch filters out no-op frontbuffer tracking flushes, which is not directly related to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: drm/amdgpu: prevent get_user_pages recursion
   - The patch title suggests that it aims to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages function.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the amdgpu_ttm_tt structure to include a spinlock and a list to track tasks inside the get_user_pages function.
   - It adds a new struct amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list to store the task_struct and list_head.
   - The patch introduces changes to the amdgpu_ttm_tt_pin_userptr function to add and remove tasks from the guptasks list using the new spinlock.
   - It also modifies the amdgpu_ttm_tt_affect_userptr function to check if the current task is already in the guptasks list before allowing access.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a potential issue of recursion in the get_user_pages function by introducing a spinlock and a list to track tasks.
   - It ensures that tasks are not added to the guptasks list multiple times, preventing recursion.
   - The changes seem to be focused on preventing potential issues rather than fixing a specific bug or security vulnerability.
   - The patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.
   - It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicated "const" keyword. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only makes the functions __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() and __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_add() symmetric, which is not a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf in the dw-mipi-dsi driver.

2. The patch changes the type of tx_buf from u16 to u8, which avoids the out-of-bounds read issue.

3. The patch also introduces a new variable, "data," which is used to explicitly encode the endianness of the tx_buf data.

4. The patch then checks the length of the tx_buf and sets the data variable accordingly.

5. If the tx_len is greater than 2, an error message is printed, and the function returns -EINVAL.

6. Finally, the patch uses the data and msg->type to generate the packet header value and calls dw_mipi_dsi_gen_pkt_hdr_write().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug by avoiding an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf and explicitly encoding the endianness. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "tcp: Validate route interface in early demux" and is signed-off by David S. Miller. It modifies the tcp_v4_early_demux function in the net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c file.

The patch introduces a new variable "dev" of type struct net_device and assigns it the value of skb->dev. It then uses this variable to check if the route interface matches the incoming interface index before setting the skb destination.

Based on the provided code, it appears that the patch aims to validate the route interface in the early demux process to avoid violating reverse path filtering.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate this patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch aims to fix a potential issue with reverse path filtering.

   - No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes or issues.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that initializes a static variable to 0. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is fixing a bug related to the port offset for DMEM registers in the drm/nouveau/falcon driver. It updates the register offsets used for reading and writing data to the DMEM registers.

The changes made in the patch seem to address a specific issue related to the port offset calculation. It modifies the register offsets used in the nvkm_falcon_wr32 and nvkm_falcon_rd32 functions by multiplying the port value by 8 instead of 16. This change ensures that the correct offset is used when accessing the DMEM registers.

The patch also includes some comments explaining the purpose of the code and the reason for masking the last word when the size is not a multiple of 4.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect behavior in the driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the value of GEN6_RP_DOWN_TIMEOUT from hexadecimal to decimal and reorders the register writes.

Instead, it seems to be a code improvement to ensure proper synchronization.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where a NULL platform data pointer is not properly handled in the ramoops_probe function. This check ensures that the driver correctly sets up a probe request and defines the platform_data structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue that could arise from incorrect driver setup.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid CamelCase naming convention. This is a trivial fix and does not fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

2. The patch is signed-off by Leo Kim, Tony Cho, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. The patch modifies the `struct scan_attr` definition by renaming `pfScanResult` to `result`.

4. The patch modifies the `Handle_Scan` function by updating the assignment of `pfUserScanResult` to `result` in the `strWILC_UsrScanReq` structure.

5. The patch modifies the `host_int_scan` function by updating the assignment of `pfScanResult` to `result` in the `scan_info` structure.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only contains a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of `dcache_readdir` to `iterate_shared` in multiple file operations structures (`spufs_context_fops`, `autofs4_root_operations`, `autofs4_dir_operations`, and `simple_dir_operations`).

2. The change is made to avoid locking the directory in `dcache_dir_lseek` since per-struct file exclusion is considered sufficient.

3. The patch is signed-off by Al Viro and is specific to the `arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs/inode.c`, `fs/autofs4/root.c`, and `fs/libfs.c` files.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code optimization or improvement.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect error message in the ext4_ext_insert_index function.
2. The error message currently refers to "logical" and "ei_block," which is incorrect.
3. The patch updates the error message to correctly refer to "eh_entries" and "eh_max."
4. The patch is signed off by the author and the maintainer.

This patch addresses a bug in the code that could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation of error messages. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds spaces around the '>>' operator in the code. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves some deallocations from the `regulator_unregister` function to the `regulator_dev_release` function. This is done to utilize the class device lifetime management features more effectively.

2. In the `regulator_dev_release` function, the patch adds two deallocations:
   - `kfree(rdev->constraints)` frees the memory allocated for `rdev->constraints`.
   - `of_node_put(rdev->dev.of_node)` releases the reference to the device tree node.

3. In the `regulator_unregister` function, the patch removes the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and the release of the device tree node.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code cleanup and optimization change.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to the of_palmas_match_tbl array in the palmas.c file. This macro is used to generate the necessary data structures for device probing based on the device tree.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the rbd_header_from_disk() function in the rbd.c file.
2. The bug could potentially lead to an overflow if the snap_count value is too large.
3. The patch introduces a local variable "size" to store the calculated size, improving readability and shortening some lines.
4. The patch replaces the use of sizeof(type) with sizeof(object) in several places, ensuring the correct size is used.
5. The patch correctly checks for potential overflow before allocating memory for the header->snapc and header->snap_sizes variables.
6. The patch also fixes the allocation size for header->object_prefix and correctly copies the block_name value.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that could lead to potential issues and improves code readability. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a warning message in the uvesafb driver.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a dummy implementation of the `->load_lut()` callback function in the `mdp4_crtc_helper_funcs` and `mdp5_crtc_helper_funcs` structures. This function is optional and not used in the code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "platform_device_put". Since the function itself already handles the case when the argument is NULL, the check is redundant.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or optimization.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the declaration of the `selinux_complete_init` function. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   - The change appears to be switching off a different random bit at some point.
   - There is no indication of any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any critical bug being fixed.
   - The change does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the "data" variable in the mpc5xxx_can_probe function const. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change is a "trivial" fix as it only modifies the variable declaration to add the const qualifier.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the way a page is released in the f2fs_write_end function. It replaces the usage of unlock_page and page_cache_release with f2fs_put_page.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "NFS: fix pnfs regression with directio writes". This suggests that it addresses a regression issue related to parallel NFS (pnfs) and direct I/O writes.

2. The commit message explains that a previous commit (57208fa7e51) did not modify the calls in direct.c, which prevented direct I/O from using pnfs. This patch reintroduces the capability.

3. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the authors.

4. In the code changes, we can see modifications in two places:
   a. Line 478: The call to `nfs_pageio_init_write` is replaced with `NFS_PROTO(dreq->inode)->write_pageio_init`. This change ensures that direct I/O writes can use pnfs.
   b. Line 782: Similar modification is made to the call to `nfs_pageio_init_write` for `inode`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a regression issue related to pnfs and direct I/O writes. It modifies the code to enable the use of pnfs for direct I/O writes. Since this is a real and critical bug fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros. These macros are described as "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscate the code." Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial code, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes section conflicts in mm/percpu.c, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue in the code.

2. The patch includes signed-off-by tags from Andi Kleen, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The patch modifies the declaration of the `pcpu_fc_names` array in include/linux/percpu.h and mm/percpu.c.

4. In include/linux/percpu.h, the patch changes the declaration of `pcpu_fc_names` from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, indicating that the array elements are constant pointers.

5. In mm/percpu.c, the patch changes the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array and changes the attribute from `__initdata` to `__initconst`, indicating that the array is initialized with constant data and is read-only after initialization.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a section conflict issue and introduces const qualifiers to the `pcpu_fc_names` array. While the patch does not explicitly address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does fix an issue that could potentially lead to problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'driver' argument from the 'pxa27x_udc_stop' function in the pxa27x_udc.c file. This change is made in preparation for future patches that will remove the 'driver' argument altogether.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the b43 N-PHY driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements reading support for radio 0x2057 and handles the different register values based on the device's PHY revision.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to radio reading support and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the format specifier used for printing a DMA address in the ti-vpe driver. The warning suggests that the format specifier '%x' expects an unsigned int argument, but the argument provided is of type 'dma_addr_t'.

The patch modifies the format specifier from '%x' to '%pad' and uses the address of the 'start_addr' field in the 'dtd' structure. This change ensures that the correct format specifier is used for printing the DMA address.

Considering the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a whitespace cleanup patch. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character to the debug messages in the DRM driver for Intel integrated graphics. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only involves a spelling change.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an inconsistency in the interrupt numbers for RTC alarms between S2MPS11 and S2MPS14 devices. This inconsistency could potentially cause issues with the rtc-s5m driver when requesting specific interrupt numbers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses an inconsistency in interrupt numbers, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "NFC: Unlink LLCP child sockets from llcp_sock_release". From the title, it seems like the patch is addressing an issue related to NFC (Near Field Communication) and unlinking child sockets.

2. The patch is signed-off by Samuel Ortiz and John W. Linville, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the `llcp_sock_release` function in the `net/nfc/llcp/sock.c` file.

4. In the modified code, there is a check to see if `llcp_sock` is equal to `local->sockets[llcp_sock->ssap]`. If it is, the corresponding entry in `local->sockets` is set to NULL.

5. If the check fails, the patch uses a loop to iterate through the linked list of child sockets (`parent->list`) and checks if `llcp_sock` is equal to any of the child sockets. If a match is found, the child socket is unlinked from the list using `list_del(&s->list)`.

6. The patch then unlocks the `local->socket_lock` mutex.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to unlinking child sockets in the NFC LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol) code. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of handling child sockets in the `llcp_sock_release` function.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific bug related to NFC and does not contain any trivial fixes, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further review and testing by the appropriate maintainers and experts in the NFC subsystem would be necessary to make a final determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the argument name of the `host_int_add_ptk` function declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a new one. The deprecated function being replaced is `create_singlethread_workqueue()` with `alloc_ordered_workqueue()`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds a check to validate the number of reserved QPs (Queue Pairs) in the mlx4 driver.

2. Impact: The number of reserved QPs can be affected by both firmware and driver requirements. If the number of reserved QPs exceeds the total number of QPs supported by the device, it can lead to issues.

3. Code Changes: The patch introduces the following changes:
   - Adds a new variable `reserved_from_bot` to store the number of reserved QPs from the bottom.
   - Checks if the sum of `reserved_from_bot` and `reserved_from_top` (existing reserved QPs) exceeds the total number of QPs.
   - If the check fails, it logs an error message and returns an error.

4. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a potential issue where the number of reserved QPs exceeds the total number of QPs supported by the device.
   - It performs a check to ensure that the sum of reserved QPs from the bottom and existing reserved QPs does not exceed the total number of QPs.
   - If the check fails, it logs an error and returns an error code.
   - This issue can potentially cause data corruption or other critical problems, making it a valid candidate for a stable release.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to the number of reserved QPs, which can lead to data corruption or other issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing check for the return value of sme_wait_for_reply function in the staging driver csr/sme_blocking.c. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "drm/mediatek: set vblank_disable_allowed to true". 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the reasons for the revert and the impact it may have on the system.

The commit being reverted sets the `vblank_disable_allowed` flag to true in the `mtk_drm_kms_init` function. This flag is related to vblank handling in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. By reverting this commit, the flag is no longer set to true.

To make an informed decision, we need to understand the reasons behind the original commit and the implications of reverting it. Unfortunately, the provided information does not include any explanation for the revert or the original commit.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine the impact of this patch. However, based on the information provided, it does not seem to fix a critical bug, a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it does not appear to be an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering these factors, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a "trivial" fix, specifically a configuration change, rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific clock configuration issue on the i.MX6 Solo/DualLite platform. The patch modifies the clk-imx6q.c file to handle the different behavior of the CCM_CBCMR register on the i.MX6 Solo/DualLite compared to the i.MX6 Quad/Dual.

Since this patch addresses a specific hardware configuration issue and does not involve trivial changes like spelling or whitespace, it can be considered a potential fix for a real and critical bug. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine its severity or impact.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation of the bug and its impact before making a final decision. If the bug is confirmed to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue, and the patch effectively addresses it, then it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if the bug is not critical or the patch does not effectively fix it, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is specific to the MIPS architecture, as indicated by the prefix "MIPS" in the patch title.

2. The patch modifies the file "arch/mips/math-emu/sp_sub.c" in the Linux kernel source code.

3. The change made in the patch is replacing the use of DPSIGN() with SPSIGN() in the ieee754sp_sub() function.

4. The reason for the change is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description.

5. The change is made in the context of handling different IEEE754 floating-point number classes.

6. The change involves flipping the sign bit of the 'y' variable when certain class pairs are encountered.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. The patch seems to be a code modification without clear justification or explanation.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further information is provided to demonstrate its significance in fixing a real and critical bug or addressing an important issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a printk(KERN_ERR) statement with a dev_err() statement in the lis3l02dq_core.c file. This change improves the error reporting by using the appropriate logging function for the device structure.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the direct usage of `put_device()` with the new API `power_supply_put()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or necessary changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for DCBX firmware commands in the mlx5 driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds two functions: `mlx5_query_port_dcbx_param` and `mlx5_set_port_dcbx_param`. These functions are used to query and set the DCBX_PARAM register for the mlx5_core_dev device.

2. The patch also adds two new enum values: `MLX5_REG_DCBX_PARAM` and `MLX5_REG_DCBX_APP`. These values are used as identifiers for the DCBX_PARAM and DCBX_APP registers.

3. Additionally, the patch adds an enum value `MLX5E_DCBX_PARAM_VER_OPER_AUTO` for the mlx5_dcbx_oper_mode enum. This value represents the auto negotiation mode for DCBX parameters.

4. The patch includes the necessary header files and function prototypes in `driver.h` and `port.h`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds functionality related to DCBX parameter handling in the mlx5 driver. However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The decision for this patch is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "net/mlx5_core: Clear outbox of dealloc uar"
   The patch title suggests that the outbox should be cleared before executing the command.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by Majd Dibbiny, Eli Cohen, and David S. Miller.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch adds a line of code to clear the "out" structure using memset before executing the command.

   ```c
   memset(&out, 0, sizeof(out));
   ```

   This change ensures that the "out" structure is initialized to zero before being used.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential issue by clearing the "out" structure before executing the command. This can prevent any uninitialized data from being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

   However, based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this change fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a defensive programming change to ensure proper initialization.

   Additionally, the change itself is a trivial fix as it only adds a memset call to initialize the "out" structure.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a real and critical bug and contains a trivial fix (memset call).

Therefore, the answer is (B) This Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it enables Tx power based on the BT (Bluetooth) status in the iwlwifi driver's BT Coex (Bluetooth coexistence) module.

2. The patch modifies the code in the bt-coex.c file.

3. In the first code modification, the patch replaces the check for bt_activity_grading being BT_OFF with a check for bt_status being false. This change implies that the patch is fixing an issue related to the incorrect usage of bt_activity_grading.

4. In the second code modification, the patch adds a check for bt_status being false to determine if BT is off. If BT is off, the function returns without performing any further actions.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the incorrect usage of bt_activity_grading and ensuring that the correct bt_status is used instead. This fix is related to the BT Coex functionality in the iwlwifi driver.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a build issue in the brcmfmac driver when the CONFIG_BRCMDBG configuration option is not set. The build issue is caused by the undeclared BRCMF_FWS_TYPE_SEQ_LEN define.

The patch introduces the missing define in the source file, which was originally added in a commit to fix an out-of-order transmission issue. However, the define was placed under an #ifdef DEBUG condition, which caused the build issue when CONFIG_BRCMDBG was not set.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real bug that causes a build error. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a missing define and resolves a build issue that prevents the driver from being built correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return type of the function `host_int_set_mac_chnl_num` from `s32` to `int`. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific component of the Linux kernel, namely netfilter's xt_hashlimit module.

2. The patch introduces a macro called XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL, which is used to validate if the set bits are within a valid range.

3. The patch modifies the existing code to use the XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL macro for validation instead of directly comparing against XT_HASHLIMIT_MAX.

4. The change ensures that only known and valid flag bits are accepted, preventing any potential issues caused by unknown or invalid flag bits.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

6. The change does not introduce any new functionality but improves the code's robustness and maintainability.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a potential issue related to validating flag bits in the xt_hashlimit module. It does not introduce any trivial changes and aligns with the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted (ACK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the display of the "tx_priority_pauseframes" statistic in the ethtool stats for the be2net driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces calls to the function `cfs_trace_free_string_buffer()` with `kfree()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `uart_usp_ff_empty_mask` function in the `sirfsoc_uart.h` file.

2. The change is a correction to the calculation of the `empty_bit` variable.

3. Previously, the `empty_bit` was calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the `fifosize` variable.

4. The patch modifies the calculation by adding 1 to the result of the logarithm calculation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that corrects a calculation in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes undesired spaces, lines, and tabs. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential ordering issue in the ECAM kernel implementation when using ioremap() to map the ECAM configuration space memory region. The patch suggests updating the ioremap() interface to use pci_remap_cfgspace() instead, which guarantees that non-posted write transactions are issued for memory writes within the ECAM memory mapped address region.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a potential ordering issue in the ECAM kernel implementation, which can impact software behavior.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, but it addresses a potential ordering issue that can impact software behavior. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, or data corruption, it can lead to unexpected behavior, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a significant change by replacing ioremap() with pci_remap_cfgspace().

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to unexpected behavior.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves message output by using pr_* instead of printk. This change is not trivial as it enhances the logging mechanism, making it more consistent and efficient.

2. The patch adds a hexdump of ECC code if the test fails. This provides additional information for debugging purposes and helps in identifying the cause of the failure.

3. The patch changes the log level for the hexdump of data from KERN_DEBUG to KERN_INFO. This change ensures that the relevant information is logged at an appropriate log level, making it easier to analyze the logs.

4. The patch factors out the hexdump code into a separate function. This improves code modularity and readability, making the code easier to maintain and understand.

Overall, the changes introduced by the patch are not trivial and contribute to improving the functionality and maintainability of the code. Additionally, the patch does not contain any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are considered trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization for the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel. It introduces a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism to improve the average lookup time for memslots.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving performance. However, it does not fall into the category of fixing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that adds a return value to the function `kvmppc_core_check_requests` in multiple files. The return value is always set to 1, indicating that the function wants to get back into the guest.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for vendor commands and events in the mac80211_hwsim driver. This functionality allows wpa_supplicant/hostapd to send a vendor command and verify the response to that command and a vendor event.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature rather than addressing an existing issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a specific issue related to module loading.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Intel graphics driver (i915) in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds code to update the pipe size and adjust the fitter if needed.
2. It checks if the "i915_fastboot" parameter is set.
3. If the parameter is set and the current pipe has an LVDS or eDP output, it performs additional operations to turn off panel fitting.
4. The operations involve writing specific values to certain registers related to panel fitting.
5. After the panel fitting adjustments, the patch continues with the existing code to update the plane and unpin the framebuffer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to panel fitting on certain Intel graphics configurations during fast boot. It does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It appears to be a specific fix for a non-critical issue and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in the stable release.

4. The patch also includes a comment explaining the reason for the modification, which is to prevent requesting more data than negotiated for certain Windows versions.

Based on the analysis, the patch fixes a potential bug that could lead to incorrect values being returned and provides a clear explanation for the modification. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue that could impact the functionality of the CIFS file system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds loopback mode support to the spi-imx driver.

2. Changes Made:
   - Added a new register definition MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG and a corresponding bit LBC (LoopBack Control).
   - In the mx51_ecspi_config() function, the patch reads the current value of MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG, sets or clears the LBC bit based on the SPI_LOOP flag in the configuration, and writes the updated value back to the register.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch introduces a new feature, loopback mode support, to the spi-imx driver.
   - Loopback mode allows the SPI controller to internally connect the transmit and receive lines, enabling testing and debugging without external devices.
   - The patch modifies the mx51_ecspi_config() function to handle the loopback mode configuration.
   - The changes made are specific to the spi-imx driver and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

4. Evaluation:
   - The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - The patch adds a new feature that enhances the functionality of the spi-imx driver.
   - The changes made are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and any relevant details, so I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, which replaces the use of `printk(KERN_ERR, ...)` with `pr_err(...)`, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a checkpatch.pl warning. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock in the GFS2 file system.

2. The patch modifies the functions gfs2_trans_add_meta and gfs2_trans_add_data in the fs/gfs2/trans.c file.

3. In both functions, a check is added to determine if the buffer_head is already in a transaction. If it is, the gfs2_log_lock is avoided, and the function jumps to the "out" label.

4. The "buffer_pinned" function is used to check if the buffer_head is already pinned. If it is, the TR_TOUCHED flag is set, and the function jumps to the "out" label.

5. After the gfs2_log_lock is acquired, the necessary operations are performed on the buffer_head.

6. Finally, the gfs2_log_unlock is called, and the buffer_head is unlocked.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock, which can improve performance but does not address a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the ipr driver in the SCSI subsystem. The patch increases the dump size in the ipr driver to 80MB to aid in debugging new SAS controllers. 

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to debugging and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for Intel Skylake. It adds support for DMA resume capability when the stream is suspended and resumed.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the patch is adding the necessary code to enable DMA resume for the stream and set the dpib and lpib positions before starting the DMA. It also saves the dpib and lpib positions when the stream is suspended.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a bug fix.

Therefore, considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless there is additional information indicating that it addresses a critical bug or issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the default value for available voltages in the mxcmmc driver. The patch ensures that if available voltages are not given, the driver sets a default value for the ocr_avail mask.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a non-critical issue related to default values.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies a NULL comparison. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ath9k wireless driver and specifically adds SERDES initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 chip. It includes changes to the ar9003_hw_init_mode_regs function in the ar9003_hw.c file and adds a new array in the ar9462_2p1_initvals.h file.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the mentioned issues. We would need more context or information about the bug or issue it aims to solve.

Without further information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, if this patch is solely adding initialization values for a specific chip version and does not address any critical bug or issue, it would not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the initial decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the i40e_acquire_nvm() function in the i40e_nvm.c file.

2. The patch adds additional debug information to the debug messages.

3. The patch changes the behavior of polling on the NVM semaphore. Previously, it would always poll, but now it will only poll if there is time left on a previous reservation.

4. The patch also adds a check to ensure that the NVM acquire request failed and there is still time left before polling.

5. If the NVM acquire request fails and there is still time left, the patch enters a loop and polls until the current NVM owner timeouts.

6. If the NVM acquire request times out, the patch updates the debug message to include the status and error code.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch improves the behavior of acquiring the NVM semaphore by avoiding unnecessary polling when there is no time left on a previous reservation. It also enhances the debug messages for better troubleshooting.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to NVM acquisition and improves the behavior, it can be considered a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds comments to the code. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the "fw_func_mode" field in the lpfc_sli4_hba structure in the lpfc driver for SCSI. The patch changes the data type of the field from uint8_t to uint32_t.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, let's check if the bug being fixed is real and critical. The patch description mentions that the "fw_func_mode" field was defined too small, which suggests that it could lead to incorrect behavior or issues when recognizing dual-chute mode. This could potentially cause functional problems or data corruption, making it a real and critical bug.

Next, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. In this case, the change from uint8_t to uint32_t seems to be a necessary modification to address the bug, rather than a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the above analysis, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the watchdog functionality in the Linux kernel. The patch propagates the error code from the watchdog_ping function to the user space, ensuring that the watchdog daemon is informed about possible hardware errors or unregistered device drivers.

The patch also includes proper error handling by checking the return value of the watchdog_ping function and returning the error code if it is less than 0. This ensures that any errors encountered during the ping operation are properly handled.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to setting the number of queues correctly in the NVMe driver. The patch modifies the `nvme_get_features` function to instead call `nvme_set_features` when setting the number of queues.

The change seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as build errors, oops, or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks certain functions as static in the `tfc_conf.c` file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only eliminates warnings related to missing prototypes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds two clocks for the mxc rtc driver on imx35, which seems to be a straightforward addition without fixing any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the mv88e6xxx_set_port_state function in the dsa/mv88e6xxx.c file. The patch ensures that the correct error code is returned if the _mv88e6xxx_reg_read function returns an error.

Since this patch addresses an error handling issue, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves cleaning up the usage of the `hcpriv` field in the `octeon-usb` staging driver. The changes involve using `ep->hcpriv` for the pipe handle and `urb->hcpriv` for the submit handle, instead of packing both into the same field.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to flushing the IOMMU TLB in the AMD IOMMU driver. The patch directly performs the flush in the `dma_ops_free_addresses` function instead of setting a flag and performing the flush later.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `dma_ops_free_addresses` function in the `amd_iommu.c` file.
2. It checks if the given address plus the number of pages exceeds the `next_bit` value in the `range` structure.
3. If the condition is true, it calls the `domain_flush_tlb` and `domain_flush_complete` functions to flush the IOMMU TLB.
4. The patch then continues with the remaining code.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to flushing the IOMMU TLB in the AMD IOMMU driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it directly modifies the code logic to perform the flush when necessary.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch is titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker support for Asus AiO ZN270IE" and is signed off by multiple contributors.

The patch addresses an issue where the Asus AiO ZN270IE with ALC256 has no audio output for the internal speaker and headphone. It requires GPIO 2 as an amp. The patch enables the GPIO and pulls it high.

Looking at the code changes, we can see that a new fixup entry is added for ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2. This fixup sets up GPIO2 for the speaker amp by sending specific AC_VERB commands.

Additionally, a new entry is added to the snd_pci_quirk table for the ASUS ZN270IE, associating it with the ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2 fixup.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific hardware issue related to audio output on the Asus AiO ZN270IE. It introduces a fixup to enable the required GPIO and associates it with the affected device in the snd_pci_quirk table.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a lack of audio output, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves code refactoring and consolidation. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of sscanf with kstrtoint. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing call to platform_set_drvdata in the da9052_bat_probe function. This fix ensures that platform_get_drvdata in da9052_bat_remove does not return NULL.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a log message if DP link training fails in the Nouveau display driver.

2. The patch modifies the while loop condition from `while (link_bw[0])` to `while ((ret = -EIO) && link_bw[0])`. This change assigns the value `-EIO` to `ret` and checks if `link_bw[0]` is non-zero. 

3. After the while loop, the patch checks if `ret` is less than 0 (indicating a failure) and logs an error message if so.

4. The patch then executes a post-train script from the vbios.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to DP link training failure and adds a log message to indicate the failure. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "bonding: check nla_put_be32 return value". This suggests that it is addressing an issue related to the bonding driver.

2. The patch is signed-off by Hangbin Liu and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. Looking at the code changes, we see that the patch modifies the `bond_fill_info` function in the `bond_netlink.c` file.

4. In the modified code, there is a call to `nla_put_be32` function, which is used to add a 32-bit attribute to a netlink message. The return value of this function is not being checked in the original code.

5. The patch adds an if statement to check the return value of `nla_put_be32`. If the return value is non-zero, indicating an error, the code jumps to a label called `nla_put_failure`.

6. The `nla_put_failure` label is not shown in the provided patch, but it suggests that there is error handling code that is not included in the patch snippet.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue where the return value of `nla_put_be32` is not being checked, which could lead to errors in netlink message handling. This fix is not trivial and could prevent potential bugs or issues in the bonding driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MC13783 RTC functionality on the MX31PDK board. Since this patch adds support for a real and critical feature (RTC), it can be considered for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) topology support in the Linux kernel. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

The patch primarily adds support for the topology file of ABI v4 and updates the ABI version macros. It also modifies the soc_valid_header() function to check for the supported ABI versions.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issues or introduce any significant improvements, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a request for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) capabilities during target initialization in the ath6kl driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new variable "ret" of type int.
   - This change seems fine and does not appear to introduce any issues.

2. The patch calls the function "ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd" with specific flags to request P2P capabilities.
   - This change is related to P2P functionality and does not seem to fix any critical bug or security issue. It appears to be an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for an existing issue.

3. The patch checks the return value of "ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd" and logs a debug message if it fails.
   - This change is a good practice for error handling and logging, but it does not fix any critical bug or security issue.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any security issue. It appears to be an enhancement or feature addition related to P2P capabilities. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of loading GVT failing and updates the value of i915.enable_gvt to false in such cases. This change allows userspace to easily detect when GVT fails to load as requested.

The patch includes a testcase (igt/gvt_basic) and is signed-off by the author (Chris Wilson) and reviewed by Zhi Wang. It also provides a link to the patch for further reference.

In the code changes, the patch replaces the "return 0" statements with a "goto bail" statement, which leads to setting i915.enable_gvt to 0 and then returning 0. This ensures that if loading GVT fails, the enable_gvt flag is marked as false.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to GVT loading and provides a clear and straightforward solution. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the registration of the wireless PHY (wiphy) in the ath6kl driver. The patch ensures that the wiphy is registered before calling the regulatory_hint() function, which is important for proper processing of regulatory events.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a potential issue related to the order of function calls during initialization.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it may still be suitable for inclusion in the mainline kernel or other development branches for further testing and refinement.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds support for the `vidioc_create_bufs` operation in the `bfin_capture` driver in the `media` subsystem. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug?

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not indicate any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make the saa7134 driver more V4L2 compliant by filtering audio modes that came from the tuner and keeping only MONO/STEREO in radio mode.

2. Impact: The patch addresses an issue related to audio modes in the saa7134 driver when in radio mode. It ensures that only valid audio modes (MONO/STEREO) are retained, which improves V4L2 compliance.

3. Bug Severity: The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a compliance issue related to audio modes in the saa7134 driver.

4. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization order of the hardware (HW) so that the interrupt is only requested after the HW is initialized. This can help avoid potential issues that may arise from requesting the interrupt before the HW is fully initialized.

2. The patch replaces the use of `irq_of_parse_and_map` with `platform_get_irq`. This change is likely made to improve code consistency and maintainability.

3. The patch also includes a reset of the SPI-HW block before requesting the interrupt. This ensures that the HW is in a known state before enabling the interrupt.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code improvement that enhances the initialization order and replaces a function call.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch converts the usage of `wait_for(I915_READ(reg))` to `intel_wait_for_register()`, which is claimed to improve efficiency and reduce code bloat.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it is not fixing any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be exporting the `tegra_chip_id` variable in the ARM Tegra platform code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial change that exports a variable.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it sets clock rates before timer initialization on the ARM-based shmobile armadillo800eva board.

2. The patch fixes an issue where the timer was using the default extal1 clock rate (25MHz) instead of the correct rate for this board (24MHz).

3. The patch is signed-off by Hideki EIRAKU and Acked-by Kuninori Morimoto.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Simon Horman, who is the maintainer of the arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-armadillo800eva.c file.

5. In the code changes, the eva_clock_init() function is moved from its original position to be called after r8a7740_clock_init() and shmobile_earlytimer_init() functions in the eva_earlytimer_init() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to clock rates on the shmobile armadillo800eva board. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a new function. The deprecated function "create_singlethread_workqueue" is replaced with "alloc_ordered_workqueue" with the flag "WQ_MEM_RECLAIM" set.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving a structure definition from one header file to another. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that encapsulates the boot vector code into a function for cpuidle. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it mainly involves code refactoring and does not address any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "dev_priv" field to the "struct intel_gmbus" in the i915 driver. This change allows the "dev_priv" pointer to be used with the bitbanging fallback algorithm.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `cx24123_pll_writereg()`. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing an unused argument), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a timeout for ramrod replies in the cnic driver for the bnx2x device.
2. It addresses the issue where the chip will not DMA any replies if it has encountered parity errors.
3. The patch uses wait_event_timeout() to make forward progress and allow bnx2x to reset the chip.
4. The patch modifies the cnic_bnx2x_destroy_ramrod() function to include the wait_event_timeout() call.
5. It also modifies the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function to include the wait_event_timeout() call.
6. The patch sets a timeout value of HZ/4 (one-fourth of a second) for the wait_event_timeout() calls.
7. It initializes the kcqe structure and sets the completion_status to FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR in the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function.
8. The patch sets the completion_status to 0 if the wait_event_timeout() call returns successfully in the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function.
9. It sets the CTX_FL_DELETE_WAIT flag and queues a delayed work task in the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function.
10. The patch adds the CNIC_RAMROD_TMO macro with a value of HZ/4 in the cnic.h header file.
11. It adds the FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR macro with a value of 0x1 in the cnic_defs.h header file.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the bnx2x device's DMA replies and parity errors. It introduces a timeout mechanism to make forward progress and reset the chip. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The failure of devm_clk_get for the core clock was being ignored, and the core_clk was explicitly set to NULL. This could lead to potential issues or unexpected behavior.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications.

3. The patch improves error handling: Instead of ignoring the failure and setting core_clk to NULL, the patch returns the error code when devm_clk_get fails for the core clock. This ensures that any potential issues are properly handled and reported.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple developers: It has been reviewed by Stephen Boyd and acknowledged by Bjorn Andersson, indicating that it has undergone scrutiny and received positive feedback.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "drm/dp/mst: reply with ACK for UP reqs" and it aims to fix the way UP (Update Port) requests are handled in the DisplayPort (DP) Multi-Stream Transport (MST) subsystem of the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver.

The patch changes the reply type from NACK (negative acknowledgment) to ACK (acknowledgment) for UP requests. Currently, the code replies with NACK, which may confuse receivers. Although no actual issues have been observed, it is still important to respond to UP requests correctly.

The change is made in the function `drm_dp_encode_up_ack_reply` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/drm_dp_mst_topology.c`. The line `reply.reply_type = 1;` is modified to `reply.reply_type = 0;`, setting the reply type to ACK.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not appear to be a trivial fix (e.g., spelling changes, whitespace cleanups) and addresses a potential issue that could cause confusion for receivers of UP requests. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and does not take into account any potential conflicts or dependencies with other patches or code in the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to memory allocation failure in the hpsa_get_device_id function in the hpsa.c file. The patch changes the return value from -1 to -ENOMEM when kzalloc fails to allocate memory.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to memory allocation failure, which can lead to potential issues such as crashes or data corruption.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, a memory allocation failure can cause various issues, including crashes and data corruption.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" on the s390 architecture. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds additional information to the /proc/cpuinfo file.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a clock for the FSI sound driver on the sh73a0 ARM platform. This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "lpfc: Fix setting of EQ (interrupt) delay Multiplier". It suggests that there is an issue with setting the EQ delay multiplier in the lpfc driver.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, including Dick Kennedy, James Smart, Hannes Reinecke, and James Bottomley. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and approval by these individuals.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup function in the lpfc_init.c file. It adds a loop to configure the EQ delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function.

4. lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay Function: The lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function is defined in the lpfc_sli.c file. It takes a startq parameter of type uint32_t and modifies the EQ delay multiplier for the specified EQ.

5. lpfc_eq_create Function: The lpfc_eq_create function is also defined in the lpfc_sli.c file. It is called within the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup function and sets up the EQ context, including the delay multiplier.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the EQ delay multiplier in the lpfc driver. It introduces a loop to configure the EQ delay multiplier for all EQs created, using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function. The patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially impact the performance or functionality of the lpfc driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a helper function addition in the tcp_input.c file. The purpose of this helper function is to prepare for the main RACK patch. 

Since the patch does not explicitly mention any bug fixes, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

Without further information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that this patch would not be accepted in a stable release (NAK) as it does not address any critical issues or provide any significant improvements.
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be adding hardware capabilities and structures for SR-IOV E-Switch in the mlx5 driver. However, without further information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix timeout issues in the QAT (QuickAssist Technology) driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch changes the data type of the variable "times" from "unsigned int" to "int" in three places: lines 389, 453, and 658. This change is necessary because the value of "times" should be -1 after the loop. This change seems reasonable and does not appear to be a trivial fix.

2. On line 402, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change ensures that the loop exits when "times" becomes negative. It seems like a valid fix for the timeout issue.

3. Similarly, on line 467, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change also seems appropriate for handling the timeout issue.

4. On line 658, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change appears to be consistent with the previous changes and should address the timeout issue.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to fix a real and critical bug related to timeout issues in the QAT driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a spelling mistake in the "greth.c" file. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that added a "drv_priv" pointer for driver use in the mac80211 subsystem. The reason for the revert is that no driver has been found to need this functionality, and the desired functionality has been implemented in a different way.

Since this patch is a revert and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any real and critical bug, it can be considered a "trivial" change. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the "const" keyword from two declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

   - The patch has been tested using dmatest for all enabled channels, indicating some level of verification.
   - The addition of the bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy function allows for preparing a DMA memcpy operation.
   - The dma_cap_set is updated to include DMA_MEMCPY capability, indicating that the driver now supports DMA memcpy.
   - The od->ddev.device_prep_dma_memcpy function pointer is updated to point to bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy.
   - BIT(DMA_MEM_TO_MEM) is added to od->ddev.directions, indicating support for DMA memcpy.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch adds a new feature to the bcm2835-dma driver, specifically support for dma_memcopy. It includes error handling improvements and has been tested. Since it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to a potentially uninitialized variable in the bcm2835_clock_choose_div_and_prate() function of the bcm2835 clock driver. 

Since this patch addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new event buffer cache in the DWC3 USB driver. The purpose of this cache is to copy triggered events from the event buffer and process them later in the bottom half handler. The patch also includes memory allocation for the cache.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue it is fixing. It only states that it is implementing a workaround for a known erratum in recent DWC3 release. Without further information about the erratum and its impact, it is difficult to determine if it qualifies as a real and critical bug fix.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not introduce any obvious issues that could lead to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It adds a new buffer cache and performs memory allocation for it.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine if the patch addresses a critical bug or issue. However, since it does not introduce any obvious issues and does not contain trivial fixes, it may be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, further evaluation and testing are necessary to determine its suitability for stable releases.

Therefore, my recommendation would be to mark this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until more information about the erratum and its impact is provided, and further evaluation is conducted.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time. This can be considered as an enhancement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. AFTR mode support has already been implemented for other Exynos SoCs.

2. Changes in Exynos3250 SoC AFTR mode support:
   - Different secure firmware calls are used.
   - Different wakeup masks (S5P_WAKEUP_MASK and S5P_WAKEUP_MASK2) need to be set.
   - The C2_STATE BOOT mode flag needs to be set/cleared pre/post AFTR.

3. Code Changes:
   - In the `exynos_do_idle` function in `firmware.c`, additional SMC commands are added for Exynos3250 to save and shutdown the core and cluster.
   - In the `exynos_set_wakeupmask` function in `pm.c`, an additional wakeup mask (S5P_WAKEUP_MASK2) is set for Exynos3250.
   - In the `exynos_aftr_finisher` function in `pm.c`, the wakeup mask value is set based on the SoC type.
   - In the `exynos_enter_aftr` function in `pm.c`, the C2_STATE boot flag is set for Exynos3250 before entering AFTR mode and cleared after resuming.
   - In `regs-pmu.h` and `smc.h`, new register definitions and SMC commands are added for Exynos3250.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds necessary support for AFTR mode in the Exynos3250 SoC, which is critical for power-saving features. The changes are specific to the Exynos3250 SoC and do not affect other SoCs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error in the `arch/mips/ath79/mach-ap136.c` file. The error is caused by passing too many arguments to the `ap136_pci_init` function. The patch adds the missing argument `u8 *eeprom` to the function declaration.

Since this patch fixes a build error, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, it can be considered a trivial fix. As per the guidelines, trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to `pwm_apply_args()` after requesting the PWM device. The comment in the code suggests that this is an intermediate state and that `pwm_apply_args()` should be removed once the atomic PWM infrastructure is in place and the driver makes use of it.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a trivial fix that can be considered a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup," it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the FSI DMAEngine in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the DMA is properly terminated at the start/stop time, which prevents noise on playback. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause audio playback issues. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to reclaim reboot state when the clientid is stale in NFSv4.0. It adds the functionality to set NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED and reclaim reboot state for all v4.0 errors and recoverable errors on EXCHANGE_ID for v4.1.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to NFSv4.0 clientid stale issues. It introduces necessary changes to handle errors and reclaim reboot state, which can prevent build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Considering the nature of the patch and its potential impact on stability and security, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to section mismatch in the ie6xx_wdt_probe() function. The patch removes the __devexit annotation from the ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit() function, which is called as part of the error cleanup path in ie6xx_wdt_probe().

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding clock definitions for the SYS-DMAC modules in the r8a7796 SoC. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch introduces two new functions, `vm_entry_controls_reset_shadow` and `vm_exit_controls_reset_shadow`, which simply read the entry/exit control fields of the VMCS and store them in the respective shadow variables.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "trivial" fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves cleaning up the ieee80211_i.h header file. The patch removes a duplicate declaration of the ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work function and also removes an unnecessary declaration at the end of the file.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable from "pvRecvBuffer" to "recv_buf" in the wilc_mq_recv function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a simple renaming of a variable for better code readability.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the KVM subsystem on the s390 architecture. It adds support for host-protection-interruption, which is introduced with ESOP (Extended Support for Opcodes). The patch modifies the `shadow_scb` function in the `vsie.c` file.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issues. The patch seems to introduce a new feature related to host-protection-interruption, but it is unclear if this feature is necessary to fix an existing problem.

Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without further information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided information, it is more likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless additional details are provided to demonstrate its criticality and necessity.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch modifies the key initialization of tcp_fastopen cookies to use the function `net_get_random_once` instead of `get_random_bytes`. This change ensures that if a user sets a custom key, it won't be overwritten when the first cookie is generated later on.

The patch also adds a new function `tcp_fastopen_init_key_once` that generates a dummy secret key but doesn't publish it. This is done to prevent the regeneration of a new key on the first invocation of `tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen`.

Overall, this patch seems to address a potential issue with key generation in tcp_fastopen cookies. It doesn't fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it appears to be more of an improvement or optimization.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The changes made in the patch involve replacing direct access to the `serial->private` field with the `usb_{get,set}_serial_data` functions.

Since the patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode for the OMAP DMA engine. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch description states that the audio stack used omap_stop_dma/omap_start_dma to pause/resume the DMA, which has been used for years on OMAP based products. This suggests that the patch addresses an existing functionality used in production systems.

2. The patch modifies the omap_chan structure by adding a new boolean field called "paused." This field will be used to track whether the DMA channel is currently paused or not.

3. In the omap_dma_terminate_all function, the patch adds a check to avoid stopping the DMA twice if it has already been paused. This ensures that the DMA is only stopped once when terminating all ongoing transfers.

4. In the omap_dma_pause function, the patch checks if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode before allowing pause/resume operations. If the channel is not in cyclic mode, it returns an error. If the channel is in cyclic mode and not already paused, it stops the DMA and sets the "paused" flag to true.

5. In the omap_dma_resume function, similar to omap_dma_pause, it checks if the DMA channel is in cyclic mode before allowing pause/resume operations. If the channel is not in cyclic mode, it returns an error. If the channel is in cyclic mode and already paused, it starts the DMA and sets the "paused" flag to false.

6. The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a new feature to the OMAP DMA engine, specifically supporting pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode. This feature has been used in production systems for years, indicating its importance and relevance. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and follows the existing code structure and conventions.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential buffer overflow issue by replacing the use of strncpy with strncmp for string comparison. This change ensures that the final null terminator is not omitted, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

2. The patch also improves the code by using the sizeof operator instead of a hardcoded constant (MEI_CL_NAME_SIZE) when copying the device name. This ensures that the correct size is used and reduces the risk of buffer overflows.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

4. The patch has been signed-off by the original author (Tomas Winkler <tomas.winkler@intel.com>) and the maintainer (Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>).

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue and improves the code without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - disable RRC by default." It suggests disabling the RRC (Radio Resource Control) feature by default in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices.

2. The patch checks if the firmware advertises support for the BT Coex RRC feature. If the firmware supports it, the feature is enabled; otherwise, it remains disabled.

3. The patch modifies the "enum iwl_ucode_tlv_capa" enumeration in the iwl-fw-file.h file to include a new capability flag, "IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_BT_COEX_RRC," indicating support for BT Coex RRC.

4. The patch updates the iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported() function in the mvm.h file to check if the BT Coex RRC feature is supported by the firmware and enabled in the driver configuration.

5. The patch modifies the iwl_send_bt_init_conf_old() function in the coex_legacy.c file to set the BT_COEX_RRC flag in the bt_cmd->flags field if the BT Coex RRC feature is supported and enabled.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new feature to disable the BT Coex RRC by default in the iwlwifi driver. It checks if the firmware supports the feature and enables it accordingly. This change does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the blk-mq subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch correctly frees the hctx->ctx_map inside the blk_mq_free_queue() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding JPEG register definitions for the CODA7541 media platform driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds JPEG specific sequence initialization registers and bit definitions to the existing code.
   - This indicates that the patch is adding necessary functionality for the JPEG support in the CODA7541 driver.

2. The patch includes new register definitions for JPEG sequence initialization.
   - These new register definitions are required for proper configuration and control of the JPEG functionality in the driver.

3. The patch also includes additional register definitions related to JPEG encoding parameters, restart intervals, thumbnail support, and offsets.
   - These additional register definitions are necessary for configuring and controlling various aspects of JPEG encoding in the driver.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch is adding essential functionality and register definitions for JPEG support in the CODA7541 media platform driver. Since it does not appear to be a trivial fix and addresses a real and critical bug or issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the lnet_ping() function in the staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/api-ni.c file. The patch changes the type of the "ids" parameter from "lnet_process_id_t *" to "lnet_process_id_t __user *".

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: Yes, it changes the type of the "ids" parameter to "__user" to properly mark the userspace pointer of lnet_ping(). This indicates that it addresses a real issue.

2. The bug is critical: It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description whether the bug is critical or not. We need to analyze the impact of the bug to determine its criticality.

3. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: The patch does not mention any specific impact of the bug. We need to analyze the code changes to determine if it falls into any of these categories.

4. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to be a trivial fix as it involves changing the type of a parameter, which can have implications on the behavior of the function.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the criticality and impact of the bug being fixed. However, considering that the patch does fix a real issue and does not seem to be a trivial fix, I would lean towards accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing would be necessary to fully assess its suitability for inclusion in the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver for Qualcomm Atheros wireless devices. The patch adds two new event handlers, `wmi_evt_linkup` and `wmi_evt_linkdown`, which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively.

The `wmi_evt_linkup` function is called when a linkup event is received from the firmware. It turns on the network device carrier using `netif_carrier_on` function. This indicates that the data path is ready.

The `wmi_evt_linkdown` function is called when a linkdown event is received from the firmware. It turns off the network device carrier using `netif_carrier_off` function. This indicates that the data path is no longer available.

Based on the provided information, this patch seems to fix a real and critical issue related to handling linkup/linkdown events in the wil6210 driver. It ensures that the network device carrier state is correctly updated based on the firmware events.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the `ieee80211_ibss_join()` function in the `ibss.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch adds a missing unlock operation on an error path.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a minor fix related to locking.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in a stable release. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to constify the `def_qos_parameters` structure in the `rtl8192u` driver's `r8192U_core.c` file.
2. The `def_qos_parameters` structure is only passed as the source parameter to the `memcpy` function and its fields are never modified.
3. The Coccinelle script confirms that the structure is only used in `memcpy` calls and not modified elsewhere.
4. The patch adds the `const` qualifier to the `def_qos_parameters` structure, indicating that it is read-only.
5. The patch is signed-off by two contributors.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. It fixes a potential issue by constifying the structure and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a local variable from "nr_irqs" to "nr_irq" in two different files. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing forward declarations of structures in cpuidle.h. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the pinctrl-mtk-common.c file. The patch ensures that the "configs" variable is properly freed before returning from the function in case of an error. This prevents a potential memory leak.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the gpio-ml-ioh driver. The patch modifies the ioh_gpio_get() function to ensure that the return value is clamped to [0,1] by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding entries in the HID table and referencing the "bytcht_da7213" driver. This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding support for a specific hardware configuration.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the socket argument in the function `tcp_create_openreq_child()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the code in drivers/acpi/osl.c.
2. It changes the allocation function from kmalloc to kzalloc, which allocates and initializes memory to zero.
3. The patch adds comments to explain the purpose of the code and its relation to lockdep complaints.
4. It rearranges the code to make fewer checks.
5. It initializes a work structure using INIT_WORK for each workqueue separately to prevent unnecessary lockdep complaints.
6. It sets the appropriate queue and wait values based on the conditions.
7. It adds a comment about preventing corruption caused by a software-initiated SMI.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code improvement and documentation update rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change only moves the initialization of the 'status' variable within the function. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a platform device registration for the HDMI audio codec on OMAP4 Pandaboard and PandaboardES boards. This patch does not seem to fix a critical bug or address any issues related to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the configuration of SDIO after power is reapplied to the device. This issue could potentially lead to functional problems or data corruption. Therefore, it seems to meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the issue at hand.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a condition that is reported as impossible. The patch removes a test for an impossible condition where `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. However, the condition `path > 0` is still present.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It only removes a test for an impossible condition, which is not a real bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs. The patch adds compatibility checks for several R-Car Gen2 SoCs, including r8a7792, r8a7793, and r8a7794. 

Since the patch enables PM runtime for these specific SoCs, it suggests that there might have been issues related to power management on these platforms. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issues being addressed.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system. If the bug is critical and causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a real security issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, if the bug being fixed is not critical or does not meet the mentioned criteria, then the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value from 0 to NULL in the host1x_bo_lookup() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any specific issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to replace the usage of `hid_output_raw_report` with `hid_hw_output_report` in the HID wiimote driver.

2. The rationale behind this change is that the new API, `hid_hw_output_report`, is equivalent to the old one, `hid_output_raw_report`, for the BT transport layer.

3. The patch is signed-off by Benjamin Tissoires and reviewed by David Herrmann, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

4. Looking at the code changes, the patch checks if the `ll_driver->output_report` function pointer is available before using it. If it is not available, the function returns -ENODEV.

5. The patch also replaces the call to `hid_output_raw_report` with `hid_hw_output_report` and removes the `HID_OUTPUT_REPORT` argument, as it is no longer needed.

6. The patch then frees the allocated buffer and returns the result of the `hid_hw_output_report` call.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a non-trivial fix that replaces an old API with a new equivalent one. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup."

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, which require fixes for real and critical bugs, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and modifies the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function to accept the frequency as an argument. It also sets the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer.

Since this patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the omapdrm driver in the Linux kernel. It changes the log level of certain error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer object size validation. Instead of printing these messages as errors, they are now printed as debug messages.

The reason for this change is to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages by validating userspace parameters. By turning these error messages into debug messages, it reduces the impact on the kernel log and avoids potential log flooding.

This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving the logging behavior and preventing log flooding.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.), it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing an unnecessary check before calling the `vfree()` function in the `asihpi_adapter_remove()` function of the `hpioctl.c` file in the ALSA asihpi driver. The patch claims that the `vfree()` function already performs input parameter validation, making the test around the call unnecessary.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a code optimization or cleanup, removing a redundant check.

Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the Mellanox mlx5 network driver. It introduces a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` that allows setting the minimum inline header mode for virtual functions (VFs) in the Physical Function (PF) side.

The function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` takes the Mellanox device (`mdev`), the virtual port number (`vport`), and the minimum inline value (`min_inline`) as parameters. It initializes an input buffer (`in`) and sets the necessary fields for modifying the NIC vport context, specifically the `min_wqe_inline_mode` field.

The patch also adds a declaration for the new function in the `vport.h` header file and updates the `mlx5_query_nic_vport_min_inline` function declaration in the `vport.h` header file.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. Without further context or explanation, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

   - Chris Mason <chris.mason@fusionio.com>

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the function __btrfs_run_defrag_inode() in the file fs/btrfs/file.c.

   - Line 318: Adds a call to sb_start_write() before calling btrfs_defrag_file(). This function is used to acquire a write lock on the superblock, which prevents concurrent modifications to the file system.
   - Line 322: Adds a call to sb_end_write() after btrfs_defrag_file(). This function releases the write lock acquired earlier.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing the file system and auto defragmentation. It ensures that when the file system is frozen, the auto defragmentation process does not run. The changes made in the patch acquire and release a write lock on the superblock to prevent concurrent modifications.

   This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue related to the interaction between freezing and auto defragmentation.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific adaptation for the OMAP3-based igep0020 board to accommodate changes in the ehci-omap driver. 

The patch introduces changes related to USB High-Speed (USBHS) PHY initialization and configuration for the igep0020 board. It registers the PHY's RESET regulators and the NOP PHY devices using the `usbhs_init_phys()` function. Additionally, it modifies the `usbhs_omap_platform_data` structure for the igep2 and igep3 boards to reflect the changes in port modes and GPIO configurations.

Since the patch does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Furthermore, the changes introduced in the patch seem to be specific to the igep0020 board and may not have broader applicability.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for port mirroring in the bcm_sf2 driver for DSA switches. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It does not explicitly mention fixing a bug, but rather adds support for a feature (port mirroring). Therefore, it does not meet this criterion.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   - The patch does not mention any of these issues, and it seems to be a feature addition rather than a fix for any of these problems. Therefore, it does not meet this criterion.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? 
   - The patch does not mention any trivial fixes, but it is focused on adding a new feature. Therefore, it does not meet this criterion.

Based on the analysis, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the cursor in the vmwgfx driver. The patch adds a call to "vmw_surface_unreference" when the surface is not suitable for the cursor, and returns an error code. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses an error path related to the cursor, which can be considered a critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   It does not seem to cause any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? 
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a superfluous check and a stray newline. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only makes the "i40e_gstrings_stats" structure const, which does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the function `lpfc_mbx_cmpl_read_topology` in the file `drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_hbadisc.c`. Here are the changes made by the patch:

1. Line 3251: The condition `(phba->fc_eventTag < la->eventTag) || (phba->fc_eventTag == la->eventTag)` is simplified to `phba->fc_eventTag <= la->eventTag`. This change increments `phba->fc_stat.LinkMultiEvent` and checks if the `lpfc_mbx_read_top_att_type` is `LPFC_ATT_LINK_UP`. If `phba->fc_eventTag` is not zero, it calls `lpfc_linkdown(phba)`.

2. Line 3260: The `phba->fc_eventTag` is updated with `la->eventTag`.

3. Lines 3262-3270: These lines are enclosed within a condition `if (phba->sli_rev < LPFC_SLI_REV4)`. Inside this condition, the `lpfc_mbx_read_top_mm` field is checked, and based on its value, the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag in `phba->sli.sli_flag` is set or cleared.

4. Lines 3280-3290: These lines check if the `lpfc_mbx_read_top_att_type` is `LPFC_ATT_LINK_UP` and if the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag is not set in `phba->sli.sli_flag`. If both conditions are true, it increments `phba->fc_stat.LinkUp` and performs additional actions.

5. Lines 3301-3310: These lines check if the `LPFC_MENLO_MAINT` flag is set in `phba->sli.sli_flag` and if the `lpfc_mbx_read_top_att_type` is `LPFC_ATT_LINK_UP`. If both conditions are true, it increments `phba->fc_stat.LinkDown` and performs additional actions.

6. Lines 3320-3330: These lines check if `phba->sli_rev < LPFC_SLI_REV4` and if the `lpfc_mbx_read_top_fa` field is set. If both conditions are true, it performs additional actions.

Based on the analysis, the patch seems to address a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields and introduces some conditional behavior based on the `phba->sli_rev` value. However, it does not fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving the validation of sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance values. The patch ensures that negative values cannot be directly written by users.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is more of an improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch aims to fix a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior. In IPv4, when a machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

The patch modifies the UDP error handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the IPv4 behavior. When the machine receives an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that affects the behavior of UDP sockets in IPv6. It addresses a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 and ensures consistent behavior for UDP sockets when receiving ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG messages.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the tty driver. The patch changes the return value from -ENOIOCTLCMD to -ENOTTY when a specific condition is met.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses an issue where the errno value returned in a specific scenario is incorrect. While it may not be a critical bug, it is a real issue that affects the correctness of error reporting.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue and does not introduce any new problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devexit_p. This function is no longer needed because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and it only removes a function that is no longer needed, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch sets the led_classdev max_brightness to the maximum level supported by hardware. This eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in brightness_set(). This change seems to optimize the code and improve efficiency.

2. The patch removes the "bright_max" variable from the struct netxbig_led_data. This variable was previously used to store the maximum brightness value, but it is no longer needed since the max_brightness is now set directly.

3. In the netxbig_led_set() function, the patch removes the calculation of "bright_val" and directly sets the value parameter as the brightness value. This simplifies the code and removes unnecessary calculations.

4. In the create_netxbig_led() function, the patch sets the max_brightness of the led_classdev to the template's bright_max value. This ensures that the maximum brightness value is correctly initialized.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch improves code efficiency and removes unnecessary calculations. It does not fix a critical bug or address a security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific performance bottleneck issue when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch renames the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()` and moves the reference acquisition into the `init_and_link_css()` function. This change makes the root csses hold a reference on `cgrp_dfl_root.cgrp`, which is stated to be harmless.

Since the patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only involves renaming and moving code, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This indicates that the function is only called in functions annotated with __init, which suggests that it is used during the initialization phase of the kernel.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature.

3. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they modify the behavior of the function and potentially free up resources after its usage.

4. The patch does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to address an internal issue related to resource management during kernel initialization.

Based on these observations, the patch seems to fix a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the code to use devm_ functions. This type of change is typically considered a "trivial" fix and does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8960: Use devm_regmap_init_i2c()". It suggests using the `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` function instead of `regmap_init_i2c()` in the `wm8960_i2c_probe()` function of the `wm8960.c` file.

The patch provides the following reasons for the change:
1. `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` is device managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup.
2. There was no explicit `regmap_exit` call in the previous implementation, indicating a potential bug.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code improvement or cleanup.

Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Anton Blanchard and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.

3. Cc: The patch is also copied to several individuals, including Ingo Molnar, Jiri Olsa, Namhyung Kim, Paul Mackerras, and Peter Zijlstra.

4. Link: The patch includes links to the original message and the reply on the LKML mailing list.

5. Code Changes: The patch modifies the vmlinux_path__init() function in the symbol.c file.

6. Code Addition: The patch adds an additional entry to the vmlinux_path array by allocating memory and copying the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

7. Code Modification: The patch modifies the size of the vmlinux_path array allocation to accommodate the additional entry.

8. Code Addition: The patch adds another entry to the vmlinux_path array by copying the path to the vmlinux file in the /lib/modules directory.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a valid fix for adding the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves code additions and modifications. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) until more information is available about the bug it addresses and its impact.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the init() and exit() platform callbacks for the imx serial driver in the imx platform code.
   - This change removes the initialization and cleanup functions for the platform device.
   - It seems that the init() and exit() functions were used to handle a specific GPIO configuration for uart0.

2. The patch replaces the moboard_uart0_init() function with moboard_uart0_init(void).
   - The new function does not take any arguments.

3. The patch removes the moboard_uart0_exit() function.
   - This function was responsible for freeing the GPIO used by uart0.

4. The patch initializes uart0_pdata with moboard_uart0_init().
   - This change initializes the platform data structure for uart0 with the new initialization function.

5. The patch calls moboard_uart0_init() in mx31moboard_init().
   - This change adds a call to the new initialization function for uart0 during board initialization.

6. The patch removes the pdata->init() call in serial_imx_probe().
   - This change removes the call to the init() function from the platform data structure.

7. The patch removes the pdata->exit() call in serial_imx_remove().
   - This change removes the call to the exit() function from the platform data structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch removes the init() and exit() platform callbacks for the imx serial driver and replaces them with a simplified initialization function. It also removes the specific GPIO configuration for uart0.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather simplifies the initialization process and removes specific GPIO configuration, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the rt2800 wireless driver. It initializes the BBP_R103 register in various subroutines for different chipsets. The changes involve setting the value of BBP_R103 to either 0xc0 or 0x00 depending on the chipset.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the mentioned issues. The patch does not provide any explicit information about the bug it is intended to fix or the impact it has on the system.

Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without further information about the bug being addressed and its impact, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided information, it is not clear if this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) until more information is available.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sizeimage setting in the coda driver for media devices. The patch updates the calculation of sizeimage in the vidioc_try_fmt and vidioc_s_fmt functions.

The original code incorrectly calculated sizeimage as the product of height and bytesperline, instead of width, height, and the factor 3/2 for YUV420 format. The patch corrects this calculation by using width, height, and the factor 3/2.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to fix a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect image sizes. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The changes involve replacing a DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC, and adding a check for the user setting tx_buffer beyond the defined limits of the driver.

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it contains trivial fixes like spelling changes and whitespace cleanups, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve replacing the usage of non-device managed APIs with their device managed counterparts. While this change may improve code simplicity and resource management, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function call with a recommended one. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to avoid an unnecessary register read in the i40e_virtchnl_pf.c file.

2. Change-Id: The Change-Id is a unique identifier for the patch, which helps in tracking changes and reviews. It does not provide any information about the patch's suitability for a stable release.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, indicating their agreement with the changes made.

4. Tested-by: The patch has been tested by Sibai Li, indicating that it has undergone testing.

5. Code Changes: The code changes involve removing the unnecessary register read and using the vf_base_id from the hw->func_caps structure instead.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a performance optimization or a minor improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary.
2. The function scsi_run_queue is split into two parts: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue.
3. The scsi_starved_list_run function is responsible for selecting a proper request queue to serve next.
4. The scsi_run_queue function is responsible for starting a new command if possible.
5. The scsi_single_lun_run function is called if the scsi_target has a single LUN.
6. The scsi_starved_list_run function is called if the starved_list is not empty.
7. Finally, the blk_run_queue function is called.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the efficiency of scsi_run_queue by avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and splitting the function into more clear parts. It also handles single LUN and starved_list scenarios appropriately.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential performance improvement and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on code cleanup and renaming functions for aesthetics. It does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field from the "sl811h_driver" structure in the "sl811-hcd.c" file. The patch claims to fix the "platform_no_drv_owner.cocci" warnings.

Since this patch only removes a single line of code and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the `struct amba_device` initialization in the `arch/arm/mach-netx/fb.c` file.
2. It removes the `NO_IRQ` initializer from the `.irq` field of the `struct amba_device` instance.
3. The `NO_IRQ` initializer indicates that the device does not have an associated interrupt.
4. The patch also removes the trailing comma after the `NETX_IRQ_LCD` value in the `.irq` field.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is removing the `NO_IRQ` initializer, which suggests that the device now has an associated interrupt. However, it is unclear whether this change is fixing a real and critical bug or addressing an "oh, that's not good" issue.

To make a final decision, we would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix. Without that information, it is difficult to determine whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the SPI bus clocks from the platform data. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function called `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0 immediately.

3. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device corresponding to the given `ifindex`.

4. If the device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the master index of the device.

5. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index.

6. Additionally, the patch includes a duplicate definition of the `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` function with a different implementation that always returns 0. This duplicate definition should be removed.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be adding a necessary helper function to lookup the l3mdev master index by device index. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to l3mdev master devices.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), with the removal of the duplicate definition of `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` function.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an uninitialized variable warning. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and cleaning up comments. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix to silence an integer overflow warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems. The patch moves the quirk for ALC255_FIXUP_DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE from the alc269_fixup_tbl to the alc269_pin_fixup_tbl.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is specific to the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems. It does not address a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug fix.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for enabling MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) for the rt2x00pci driver in the Linux kernel. 

Enabling MSI can improve performance and reduce interrupt latency for PCIe devices. However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a type mismatch issue in the `capi20_manufacturer` function. The function is declared with an `unsigned int` argument, but it is called with an `unsigned long` argument. This type mismatch can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or bugs.
2. The patch corrects the function prototype to match the actual argument type used in the function call. This ensures that the function is correctly defined and used as part of the user-visible API.
3. The patch was spotted with Coverity, indicating that it was identified as a potential issue through static code analysis.
4. The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Since the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate error message. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for increasing the required skbuff headroom for firmware signaling in the brcmfmac driver. The patch adds additional headroom to accommodate signaling protocol data between the host and firmware.

The patch includes changes to the brcmf_proto_bdc_header structure, adding a new field for data_offset and defines a maximum length for firmware signal data in the tx path. It also updates the brcmf_proto_attach function to increase the hdrlen by the required headroom.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to firmware signaling and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a "name" field to the omapdss's outputs structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag in the samples/seccomp/dropper.c file. This flag is required to enable seccomp, and the patch allows the dropper program to be run without requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a functional enhancement to allow running the dropper program without CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: "drm/exynos: fix buffer pitch calculation"
   This indicates that the patch aims to fix a bug related to buffer pitch calculation in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for Exynos GPUs.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - Cooper Yuan <cooperyuan@gmail.com>
   - Inki Dae <inki.dae@samsung.com>
   - Kyungmin Park <kyungmin.park@samsung.com>

   These lines indicate the authors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the calculation of the buffer pitch in the exynos_drm_gem_dumb_create() function.

   Before the patch:
   ```
   args->pitch = args->width * args->bpp >> 3;
   ```

   After the patch:
   ```
   args->pitch = args->width * ((args->bpp + 7) / 8);
   ```

   The patch changes the calculation of the pitch by adding 7 to args->bpp before dividing it by 8. This change ensures that the pitch is correctly calculated when the bpp (bits per pixel) is not a multiple of 8.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific bug related to buffer pitch calculation in the Exynos DRM driver. It fixes a potential issue where the pitch calculation could be incorrect when the bpp is not a multiple of 8. This bug could lead to data corruption or display artifacts.

   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption or display artifacts, and it does not contain any trivial changes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the Linux kernel codebase would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "regulators" array in the lp3972.c file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or improvement.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable atomic fb-helper support in the i915 driver. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   No, the patch does not mention fixing any specific bug. It seems to be adding a feature or enabling a capability.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not indicate any of these issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the function `hdmi_probe_pdata()` in the `hdmi.c` file of the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. The function currently lacks proper error handling, which can lead to resource allocation failures and subsequent issues.

The patch modifies the function signature from `void` to `int`, indicating that it will now return an error code. This change allows for proper error propagation and handling.

Within the function, several error conditions are checked. If the `plat_dssdev` is not found, the function returns 0, indicating success. If `dss_alloc_and_init_device()` fails to allocate memory for `dssdev`, the function returns -ENOMEM, indicating an out-of-memory error.

Further error checks are performed during device initialization and connection. If any of these steps fail, the function returns the corresponding error code.

In the `omapdss_hdmihw_probe()` function, the modified `hdmi_probe_pdata()` is called. If it returns an error, the necessary cleanup steps are performed, including calling `hdmi_panel_exit()`, `hdmi_uninit_output()`, and disabling power management runtime.

Overall, the patch adds proper error handling to `hdmi_probe_pdata()`, ensuring that any resource allocation failures or initialization errors are appropriately handled and propagated.

Given that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by adding necessary error handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for spurious interrupts on SDIO controllers found on Marvell Kirkwood SoCs. The patch checks if any interrupts are expected and bails out early if not, to avoid a warning later.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a workaround for a non-harmful issue related to spurious interrupts.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. The patch modifies the qla2x00_gpn_id, qla2x00_gnn_id, and qla2x00_gfpn_id functions to stop iteration after the first failure. This change is made by introducing a break statement after setting the rval variable to QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED.

Since the patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause failures in the GPN_ID, GNN_ID, and GFPN_ID operations, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing inline wrappers for nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64 functions in the netlink subsystem. These functions allow retrieving the payload of __le32 and __le64 netlink attributes respectively.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the deprecated macro DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE(). The patch replaces it with the recommended usage of 'struct pci_device_id'. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a call to `phy_suspend` when the `phydev` enters the HALTED state. While this may save power, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some unused #defines from the wlan_bssdef.h file in the staging driver for the rtl8723au wireless chipset. The removed #defines are related to NDIS_802_11_STATUS_TYPE and authentication/integrity fields.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to refactor the soft_offline_page() function in the mm/memory-failure.c file. It addresses the issue of multiple return points randomly intermingled with some "goto done" return points. The patch adjusts the function structure to have separate paths for success and failure, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, the patch replaces the use of atomic_long_add with atomic_long_inc, which is a more appropriate function for incrementing atomic long variables.

The changes made in the patch do not fall under the category of trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they improve the code structure and address potential issues related to soft offline of memory pages.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose and the absence of trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary out-of-memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for checking the return values of nla_parse() in various functions in the nl80211.c file. The patch ensures that the attributes are actually what is expected by checking the return value of nla_parse() and handling any errors appropriately.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue with attribute parsing, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `of_find_property` with `of_property_read_u32` for reading integer values. This change helps reduce the number of variables used.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a call to `seq_printf` with `seq_puts` for a specific string. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any of the mentioned issues explicitly.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to VLAN handling in the i40e driver for Intel Ethernet devices. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions to prevent them from operating when the VLAN ID (VID) is less than 1 or when the Port VLAN ID (PVID) is set. Additionally, the functions are updated to take a u16 data type instead of s16.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a functional improvement or optimization related to VLAN handling.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `cpia1.c` file of the `gspca` driver in the `media` subsystem. The patch converts a nonnegative error return code to a negative one, which is consistent with the error handling convention in the function.

Since the patch addresses a real bug by correcting an error return code, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the NVRAM location from 14 to 16 for reading the SCSI host ID. This change is based on documentation and confirmed by testing.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific hardware issue related to the RT5645 codec. The patch adds support for the ACPI ID "10EC5640" and includes a DMI quirk for jack detection.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a specific hardware issue related to the RT5645 codec on certain CHT platforms.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   The patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)? 
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug related to dereferencing a null pointer in the redrat3 driver. The patch correctly handles the case where the allocation fails by jumping to the "no_endpoints" label instead of dereferencing the null pointer.

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to a crash or data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused code and removes setting the gadget name in the driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code and making a minor change, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a constant value from `AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_RECOVERY` to `AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_INIT_RECOVERY`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to "unclaimed register" messages on Haswell after suspend/resume. The patch checks the generation of the Intel GPU and only saves/restores the DSPARB register if the generation is less than or equal to 4.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary Out-of-Memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "idle_bias_off" option to the cs53l30_codec_driver structure. This option sets the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF instead of SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only changes the names of the "DP" speakers to "DP1" and "DP2" and updates the corresponding routes in the nau88l25_max98357a machine.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only contains trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the memory_lseek() function in the drivers/char/mem.c file. The patch replaces a comparison of the new offset with a hard-coded value of -MAX_ERRNO with the use of IS_ERR_VALUE() macro.

The change improves code readability and maintainability by using a standard macro instead of a hard-coded value. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch adds a definition for a regulator supply in the board file for better power management. However, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for enabling the TX wakeup bit in the wer register for OMAP2+ UART.
   - This is not a critical bug fix, but rather a feature enhancement. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

2. The patch also restores the wer register when context is lost.
   - This is not a critical bug fix either, but rather a context restoration improvement. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

3. The patch includes changes to the uart_omap_port structure, adding a new member "wer" and "features".
   - These changes are not critical bug fixes but rather additions to the data structure. They do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

4. The patch modifies the serial_omap_startup function to enable the TX wakeup bit in the wer register if the feature is supported.
   - This change is related to the feature enhancement mentioned earlier and does not fix a critical bug. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

5. The patch modifies the omap_serial_fill_features_erratas function to set the OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP feature flag for certain UART revisions.
   - This change is related to the feature enhancement mentioned earlier and does not fix a critical bug. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

6. The patch modifies the serial_omap_restore_context function to restore the wer register.
   - This change is related to the context restoration improvement mentioned earlier and does not fix a critical bug. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch titled "ixgbe: Add a new netdev op to allow/prevent a VF from querying an RSS info" adds a new netdev operation to enable or disable the ability of a specific Virtual Function (VF) to query its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key.

The patch includes changes to the ixgbe.h, ixgbe_main.c, ixgbe_sriov.c, ixgbe_sriov.h files, and introduces a new boolean variable "rss_query_enabled" in the vf_data_storage structure.

Looking at the changes, it appears that this patch adds a new feature to the ixgbe driver, allowing users to control whether a VF can query its RSS information. This feature is currently limited to 82599 and x540 devices only, with support for other devices planned for future updates.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it introduces a new feature to control VF behavior.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It should not be accepted (NAK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to clock gating in the sunxi-mmc driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that the MMC core assumes the clock will be gated when the bus frequency is set to 0, which has been ignored so far. This suggests that there might be a bug or an issue related to clock handling.

2. The patch adds a check to gate the clock when the bus frequency (ios->clock) is set to 0. This ensures that the clock is properly gated when required.

3. The patch also includes a check for a specific configuration (8 bit DDR with MMC_BUS_WIDTH_8) that requires a higher module clock. This indicates that the patch addresses a specific scenario where clock handling needs to be adjusted.

4. In the sunxi_mmc_set_ios() function, the patch removes the check for ios->clock in the clock setup section and only keeps the check for ios->power_mode. This change suggests that the clock setup should be performed regardless of the clock frequency, as long as the power mode is set.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue related to clock gating in the sunxi-mmc driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a necessary check and modifies the clock setup logic. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip. The patch increases the total number of interrupts from 8 to 34, which aligns with the three different interrupt ranges handled by the TWL4030 (8 for the core, 8 for power events, and 18 for GPIOs).

Since this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to extend the frequency range of the Max2165 tuner driver to cover Hong Kong's digital TV broadcasting. The change increases the maximum frequency from 780000000 to 862000000. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a specific enhancement to support a particular frequency range for a TV tuner card.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a configuration issue related to antenna diversity for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. The patch checks the chip type and sets different values accordingly.

Since this patch addresses a specific hardware configuration issue and does not involve trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to parenthesis alignment in the ppdev driver. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a real issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if this patch has been tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers and if it has been successfully applied and tested on the affected platforms.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing a macro and replacing it with local variables. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the fec driver in the Linux kernel. It introduces a new property, "phy-reset-duration," which allows boards to specify the duration of the phy reset in their device tree. This is important because different boards may require different reset durations.

The patch also includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not longer than 1 second, as a longer duration would be considered invalid. If the "phy-reset-duration" property is not present, the default duration of 1 millisecond is used.

Since this patch addresses a real issue and provides a necessary enhancement, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting pointer math to array access. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the "nct7802_regmap_config" struct in the "nct7802" driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves enabling and disabling interrupts in the meson-gx-mmc driver. The patch removes the code that clears, acknowledges, and enables interrupts in the meson_mmc_request function, and instead enables interrupts in the meson_mmc_probe function and disables interrupts in the meson_mmc_remove function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb_probe() function. The "__devinit" attribute is used to mark functions that are only called during device initialization and can be discarded after that. However, since the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option is going away, the "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed.

Given that this patch only removes a deprecated attribute and does not fix any real or critical bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compile warning in the ARM architecture's PSCI implementation. The change simply adds a return statement with a value of 0 to the `psci_init` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve dropping unneeded checks and removing some conditional statements. Since the patch does not address any specific issue or bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch is simply optimizing the code by avoiding redundant function calls. Since it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant type casting. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture. The patch modifies the code to use the `of_read_number` function instead of directly accessing the device tree properties as `u32` pointers.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug related to endianness and ensures proper handling of device tree properties, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointer to the `musb` structure from the `tusb_omap_dma` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or significant improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the functions `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. These functions are currently defined as non-static, but they are only used within the same source file `dst_cache.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only contains a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a line length issue in the serqt_usb2.c file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a few missing clocks for different MIPS platforms. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential issue with the order of operations in the dsa_slave_create() function. The patch ensures that the netdev is registered before connecting the phy, which avoids an info message with an uninitialized name.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch replaces the direct comparison of jiffies with a more robust function, time_before, which is designed for comparing jiffies against other values.

Since this change improves the reliability and correctness of the code, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not fall into the category of trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the struct device pointer to point to the USB device instead of the input device.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the BUG_ON statement from the mmc_ext_csd_open function in the debugfs.c file. Instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch returns an error value to the caller if the condition n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN is not met.

The rationale behind this change is that the author believes that the condition n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN is unlikely to happen. By returning an error value instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch ensures that the error is properly propagated to the caller.

Since the patch replaces a BUG_ON with proper error handling, it does not introduce any new issues and improves the code's robustness. It does not fall into the category of "trivial" fixes, as it addresses a potential bug and improves error handling.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the attribute index for temperature sensors in the ixgbe driver. While it aligns with the hwmon ABI, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "[media] v4l: Casting (void *) value returned by kmalloc is useless". This suggests that the patch is addressing a casting issue related to the kmalloc function in the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem.

2. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the code in the vino_allocate_buffer function in the vino.c file. Specifically, it removes the unnecessary casting of the return value of kmalloc.

3. Analysis: The patch addresses a casting issue that does not have any direct impact on build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or improvement rather than fixing a critical bug.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It appears to be a trivial fix related to casting, which falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a single line of code. The change removes the "filter_relative" option from the symbol_conf structure in the symbol.c file.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the mos7720.c driver to use the module_usb_serial_driver() call instead of having a module_init/module_exit function. This change eliminates duplicated code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary braces. This type of change falls under the category of "trivial" fixes, which are not accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves an assignment statement out of an if () block. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, which is not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host
   - The patch aims to handle a new MTU value when the host reduces it due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the `nvsp_message` structure in `netvsc.c` to include the new MTU value.
   - It updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function in `netvsc_drv.c` to set the limit for MTU based on the `NETVSC_MTU` value minus `ETH_HLEN`.
   - It adds code in `rndis_filter.c` to retrieve the MTU value from the host and assign it to `net_device->ndev->mtu`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses the issue of handling a reduced MTU value set by the host due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.
   - It modifies the `nvsp_message` structure to include the new MTU value, ensuring proper communication with the host.
   - It updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function to set the correct limit for MTU based on the `NETVSC_MTU` value minus `ETH_HLEN`.
   - It retrieves the MTU value from the host and assigns it to `net_device->ndev->mtu` in `rndis_filter.c`.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to handling the MTU value reduced by the host. It ensures proper communication and avoids potential issues with encapsulation. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of using the lookup table to set the baud rate only when the ioclk is 150MHz. It mentions that some boards might set ioclk to a different frequency.

2. The patch recalculates the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz.

3. The patch also includes changes to get the clk in the probe function and put it in remove.

4. The patch removes the variable "ioclk_rate" and the associated assignment.

5. The patch checks if the port's uartclk is equal to 150000000 before performing the common rate fast calculation.

6. The patch adds code to get the clk and set the port's uartclk to the clk rate in the probe function.

7. The patch includes error handling for clk_get and clk_prepare_enable.

8. The patch disables and unprepares the clk in the remove function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the baud rate calculation when the ioclk is not 150MHz. It also includes necessary changes to handle the clk in the probe and remove functions.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the baud rate calculation and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply replaces the open-coded function call `_regulator_is_enabled()` with the function call itself. This change does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be converting the variable `num_drc_entries` from an unsigned int to an atomic_t type. This change allows for removing the spinlocking around the variable.

Analyzing the patch against the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a performance optimization by replacing a spinlock with an atomic operation.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it exports the `confirm_error_lock` symbol so that it can be used in the PCI surprise hot remove path to freeze the affected PE. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, this patch is a non-trivial change that adds functionality to the codebase. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

In general, exporting symbols is a common practice in the Linux kernel, and if this change is necessary for the proper functioning of the PCI surprise hot remove path in the powerpc architecture, it may be considered acceptable for inclusion in a stable release.

However, as an AI, I cannot make the final decision. It is recommended to consult with the relevant maintainers and reviewers of the Linux kernel for their expert opinion on whether this patch should be accepted in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a formatting issue in the perf trace code. The patch adds a closing parenthesis to the fprintf statement in the trace__sys_enter function. 

Since this patch only addresses a formatting issue and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment in the cxgb4vf driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the "do_gro" function in the "sge.c" file of the cxgb4vf driver. It adds an increment to the "vlan_ex" counter in the "rxq->stats" structure when "pkt->vlan_ex" is true. This counter keeps track of the number of VLAN packets processed.

The change itself seems to be addressing a real issue related to VLAN extraction. Incrementing the counter when a VLAN packet is encountered ensures accurate statistics tracking.

However, it is important to note that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these considerations, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL function in the amdgpu driver. The patch adds amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in different cases of the switch statement, ensuring that the BO is properly unreserved before returning.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch splits the function `media_graph_walk_next()` into two functions: `media_graph_walk_next()` and `media_graph_walk_iter()`. This is done because `media_graph_walk_next()` is becoming more complicated, especially with the addition of `has_routing()` support.

2. The `media_graph_walk_iter()` function is introduced to handle the iteration logic of the graph walk. It retrieves the current entity and link, checks if the link is enabled, checks if the entity has already been visited, and pushes the new entity to the stack if it hasn't been visited.

3. The `media_graph_walk_next()` function now uses `media_graph_walk_iter()` to perform the graph walk iteration. It continues the iteration until there are no more entities on the current level.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code refactoring or optimization to improve the readability or maintainability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable oprofile support on Lantiq targets. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, the decision would be (B) to not accept it (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an AUXDATA entry for the "nvidia,tegra30-ahub" device in the tegra30_auxdata_lookup array. This is necessary for clock lookups to work correctly for the Tegra30 I2S and AHUB modules.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. It falls under the category of a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup" as mentioned in the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the `finit_module` syscall in the SH architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

Since the patch is adding support for a new syscall, it does not fix a bug or address an existing issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the return value of the `rb532_gpio_get` function by using the `!!` design pattern. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the twl6040_power() function in the mfd/twl6040.c file. The patch checks the return value of the clk_prepare_enable() function and propagates the error in case of failure.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a potential issue in the twl6040_power() function by checking the return value of clk_prepare_enable().

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, but it is related to power management, which can have critical implications if not handled correctly.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a necessary error handling check.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a potential issue and meets the criteria for acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing duplicate code and using a generic function instead. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch modifies the kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page function in the arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c file. It adds a check for sp->role.invalid and is_obsolete_sp() before calling kvm_reload_remote_mmus().

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of obsolete pages in the KVM MMU. It introduces a check to prevent calling kvm_reload_remote_mmus() when the page is marked as invalid or obsolete.

To determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided patch content, it appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue related to obsolete pages in the KVM MMU.

Given this information, it is likely that this patch addresses a real and critical bug, potentially related to data corruption or stability issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being fixed would be necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()` to disable the ISA DMA controller and return the residue. This function is in line with the purpose of the staging driver and helps improve code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch modifies the `disable_dma_on_even()` function to use the new helper function `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `get_dma_residue()`. This change improves code clarity and reduces duplication.

3. The patch also modifies the `das16_interrupt()` function to remove the unnecessary `claim_dma_lock()`, `clear_dma_ff()`, and `release_dma_lock()` calls. These calls are not needed since the DMA lock is already claimed and released in the `disable_dma_on_even()` function.

4. The patch modifies the `das16_alloc_dma()` function to use the new helper function `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `release_dma_lock()`. This change improves code consistency and reduces duplication.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue by introducing a helper function and improves code clarity and maintainability. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is focused on fixing a critical bug related to the ISA DMA controller. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a function called `add_temp_sensors` which scans temperature sources used for fan control and reports if additional monitoring registers are available. This indicates that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to temperature monitoring.

2. The `add_temp_sensors` function iterates over the temperature sources and checks if there are any additional monitoring registers available. If available, it enables monitoring for those registers.

3. The `add_temp_sensors` function is then called twice in the `nct6775_probe` function to find unmonitored temperature registers and enable monitoring if additional registers are available. This ensures that all temperature sources are properly monitored.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug related to temperature monitoring in the `nct6775` driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the machine could be killed due to an incorrect USB endpoint type. Instead of triggering a BUG(), the patch replaces it with a dev_WARN() call to warn about the unknown endpoint type and continue execution.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue but does not fall into the category of a "real and critical bug." Additionally, the change does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

4. The change replaces the usage of the main interface with the interface supplied by the caller. This modification ensures that the correct interface is used for vendor-specific commands.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the vendor command interface in the brcmfmac driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the code. The patch suggests holding the spinlock for a shorter duration by moving the spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_unlock_irqrestore() calls inside the loop. This change aims to reduce the time the spinlock is held, potentially improving performance and reducing the likelihood of contention.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a potential performance improvement, it does not fall into the category of fixing a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: mxs: correct 'direction' of device_prep_dma_cyclic". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the 'direction' parameter in the mxs driver for the ASoC subsystem.

2. Looking at the commit message, it mentions that commit 49920bc changed the type of the 'direction' parameter from dma_data_direction to dma_transfer_direction in the device_prep_dma_cyclic function.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

4. In the code changes, we can see that the 'direction' parameter is updated from DMA_TO_DEVICE to DMA_MEM_TO_DEV for the SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK case.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the 'direction' parameter in the mxs driver. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes seem to be relatively trivial, involving a simple update of the 'direction' parameter value.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it suggests printing a message to let the user know they could try using "pci=realloc" if some PCI device resources are unassigned. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only adds a suggestion message.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing static storage class specifiers in the udl_connector.c file. The patch addresses sparse warnings related to undeclared symbols and suggests making them static.

   Yes, the patch addresses a potential issue with the alternatives patching on secondary CPUs, which could leave them in a limbo state between the old and new code. This can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the driver does not pass the number of tasks to the QM (Queue Manager) init logic. This can cause back-pressure in scenarios requiring many tasks, leading to reduced performance.

2. Impact: The issue described in the patch can potentially impact performance in scenarios where a large number of tasks are required, such as when using max MRs (Memory Regions). This suggests that it could be a real and critical bug affecting system performance.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the `qed_qm_init_pf` function in the `qed_cxt.c` file. It adds a new parameter, `num_tids`, to the `params` structure and assigns it the value of `iids.tids`. This change ensures that the number of tasks is passed to the QM init logic.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can impact system performance. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a failure in adding a route when a nonsensical route is added, resulting in incorrect route lookup and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes a specific issue related to locally assigned nexthop addresses in IPv6 routing.

3. The patch includes a test that checks if the nexthop gateway is a local address, ensuring that the issue is properly handled.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by Hannes Frederic Sowa, indicating that it has undergone peer review and is considered appropriate.

5. The patch is signed-off by Florian Westphal and David S. Miller, further indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers.

   Specifically, it corrects a copy/paste error in the line:
   `value = SOR_CSTM_LVDS | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B | SOR_CSTM_UPPER;`
   The corrected line is:
   `value = SOR_CSTM_LVDS | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_A | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B | SOR_CSTM_UPPER;`

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a copy/paste error in the code, which suggests that it is a bug fix.
   However, this bug does not seem to cause any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
   It appears to be a relatively minor issue that does not fall under the category of "real and critical" bugs.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). The issue it fixes does not meet the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes a build error on arm64 architecture, which is a real and critical bug. The error is caused by the undeclared 'PERF_REGS_MAX' variable in the 'util/event.h' file. The patch adds the missing definition of 'PERF_REGS_MAX' for arm64, resolving the build error.

Since the build error can prevent the kernel from being built on arm64, it qualifies as a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch is a trivial fix that initializes the boolean variable 'found' to false. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (initializing a variable), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be given a NAK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a compiler warning related to a debug print statement in the iommu.c file. The change modifies the format specifier for the "pgsize" variable in the pr_debug statement.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions in the MIPS architecture. The bug was introduced by a previous commit that changed the offset of certain PTE bits, causing incorrect calculations in these functions.

The patch correctly addresses the issue by using the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask instead of hardcoding values. It also includes the necessary Fixes tag and is signed-off by relevant individuals.

Considering the patch fixes a real bug that can potentially cause build errors or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes made in the patch are simply replacing the usage of the `greybus_set_drvdata` function with direct assignment to the `gdev->gb_tty` field and vice versa.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that defines a constant for the LRW block size and replaces the usage of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` with the defined constant. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only renames an argument in the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map`. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds additional fields to be recognized by the WACOM_PEN_FIELD and WACOM_FINGER_FIELD macros in the HID Wacom driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to setting the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag in the clone_mnt function in fs/namespace.c. The patch checks if the CL_EXPIRE flag is set and if the old->mnt_expire list is empty before setting the MNT_LOCKED flag in mnt->mnt.mnt_flags.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

From the patch, it seems that the fix is related to preventing unprivileged users from revealing what is under a mount. It checks if the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag is set and if the CL_EXPIRE flag is not set or if the old->mnt_expire list is empty before setting the MNT_LOCKED flag. This indicates that the patch addresses a security issue by ensuring that unprivileged users cannot access certain mount points.

Considering that the patch addresses a real security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a quirk for the ASUS X75VD laptop to fix Wi-Fi functionality. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a Wi-Fi issue on the ASUS X75VD laptop, which can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   No, the patch does not seem to introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? 
   No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a prefix to the print format in the asymmetric key signature handling code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses warnings reported by the compiler when building the microblaze architecture's kgdb.c file. These warnings indicate a comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions, which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. 

The patch resolves the issue by changing the loop counter variables from signed integers (int) to unsigned integers (unsigned int). This ensures that the loop counter and the comparison expression have the same type, eliminating the warning and potential issues.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could lead to unexpected behavior, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, as specified in the requirements.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a warning that occurs during the kernel build with W=1. It marks the function `ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg` as static, which is only used in the file where it is declared. Since the function does not require a declaration and is not used outside of the file, marking it as static is appropriate.

This patch does not fall under the category of "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue in the code and improves code quality.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `bt_coex_active` module parameter into the `iwlagn_mod_params` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces two new knobs, idgen_retries and idgen_delay, for IPv6 address generation. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. 

The patch modifies the netns_sysctl_ipv6 structure in include/net/netns/ipv6.h to include the new knobs idgen_retries and idgen_delay. It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in inet6_net_init() function in net/ipv6/af_inet6.c and adds corresponding entries in the ipv6_table_template and ipv6_table structures in net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c.

In addrconf_dad_failure() function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch replaces the hardcoded values of idgen_retries and idgen_delay with the values from the net->ipv6.sysctl structure.

In ipv6_generate_stable_address() function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch replaces the hardcoded value of idgen_retries with the value from dev_net(idev->dev)->ipv6.sysctl structure.

Overall, this patch introduces new knobs for IPv6 address generation and makes use of these knobs in relevant functions. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to auto-mute or auto-mic functionality for retasked jacks in the ALSA HDA driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to skip automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed. This is done by checking if the pin is retasked as an input using the `snd_hda_codec_get_pin_target` function.

2. In the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function, the patch adds a similar check to skip detecting pins retasked as outputs. This is done before checking if the jack is detected using `snd_hda_jack_detect`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to retasked jacks and ensures that automute and autoswitch functionality is skipped when the pin direction is different. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it involves modifying the behavior of the driver based on the pin direction.

Considering that this patch addresses a real issue related to audio functionality and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a build error by adding a missing declaration of the `cmpxchg64` function. Since the error is related to a missing function declaration, it does not appear to fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch would be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. The patch calculates the location of query 8 dynamically instead of hardcoding the offset. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. It seems to be a non-trivial fix that improves the code's flexibility and maintainability. However, it does not address any critical bug or issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code reorganization and optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the application of feature fixups earlier in the boot process for 64-bit PowerPC architecture. While this change may have some impact on MMU management and interrupts, it does not address any specific issue causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical problems.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported in the zl10353 driver for DVB frontends. The patch changes the calculation of the SNR value from a raw hardware register value to a value in a 0.1 dB scale.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC interrupt controller driver. The changes include adding more register documentation and defining register addresses.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds documentation and register definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a "line over 80" issue by removing a comment. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. This build error prevents the 'rspi_of_match' symbol from being declared, causing a compilation failure.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi driver. The patch modifies the if condition by changing the logical OR operator (||) to a logical AND operator (&&). 

The original if condition checks if the sscanf function returns a value other than 1 and if the mode variable is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the modified if condition checks if the sscanf function returns a value other than 1 or if the mode variable is not equal to 2 and not equal to 1.

This change seems to be incorrect because it will always evaluate to true. The mode variable cannot be both 2 and 1 at the same time, so the condition will always be true, resulting in -EINVAL being returned. This could potentially introduce a bug or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather introduces a potential issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro. The change itself does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for the wil6210 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds debug prints for vring de-allocation in the wil_vring_free() function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves some variables from one file to another. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it includes some trivial changes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to avoid common clk framework warnings. This change seems to be addressing a potential issue related to clock handling.

2. The patch adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_start` function. If either of these calls fails, the function will return the error code and clean up resources before exiting. This is a good practice for error handling.

3. Similarly, the patch adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `atmel_usba_stop` function. Again, this is a good practice for proper resource cleanup in case of failure.

4. The patch also adds error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls in the `usba_udc_probe` function. If `clk_prepare_enable` fails, an error message is printed, and the function jumps to the `err_clk_enable` label for cleanup. This ensures that resources are properly released in case of failure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses potential issues related to clock handling and adds proper error handling. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __func__ argument from the dev_err function calls in the gdm72xx driver. This change removes the specific instance of the device from the log printout.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for setting correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions in the x86/PCI code. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch moves the final fixups from __init to __devinit. This change suggests that the final fixups should not be executed during the initialization phase (__init) but rather during device enumeration (__devinit).

2. The changelog indicates that the patch is signed-off by Myron Stowe and Bjorn Helgaas. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The patch modifies the function quirk_amd_nb_node in the quirks.c file under the arch/x86/kernel directory. The function is currently defined as "__init" and is changed to "__devinit".

4. The quirk_amd_nb_node function sets correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions. This fix is specific to AMD systems and ensures that the correct NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node information is assigned to the AMD NB (Northbridge) functions.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch is fixing a specific issue related to setting correct NUMA node information for AMD NB functions. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it seems to address a specific problem that could potentially cause incorrect NUMA node assignment on AMD systems.

Considering the nature of the fix and the fact that it is specific to a particular hardware configuration, it is reasonable to conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the Acer Aspire 5741 model. The patch adds the necessary quirk to the video_vendor_dmi_table to address the broken ACPI-video backlight control for this particular model.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects a specific hardware model, it can be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. However, to make a final decision, further analysis is required, such as reviewing the bug report and considering any potential side effects or regressions that the patch may introduce.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I would lean towards accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that allows the inclusion of the ".GCC.command.line" section in modules to prevent modpost warnings. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, specifically for the sense buffer and scatter-gather (SG) list mapping.

2. In the function `advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma`, the patch checks for a DMA mapping error using `dma_mapping_error`. If an error occurs, it logs a debug message and returns 0.

3. In the function `asc_build_req`, the patch checks if the sense buffer mapping failed and returns `ASC_BUSY` if so.

4. In the same function, the patch also checks for an SG list mapping failure and returns `ASC_BUSY` if it fails. It logs a debug message in case of failure.

5. In the function `adv_build_req`, similar error checking is added for the sense buffer mapping and SG list mapping.

6. In the function `asc_execute_scsi_cmnd`, if `asc_build_req` returns an error (not `ASC_NOERROR`), the function returns the error code.

Overall, the patch adds necessary error handling for DMA mapping failures in the advansys driver. It addresses potential issues that could lead to build errors, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch adds a warning to catch the case where an object larger than 43 bits is created, which could lead to crashes later on. This bug could potentially cause data corruption or system instability.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the function signature and adding a warning message.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch are straightforward and do not introduce any new risks or regressions.

4. The patch has been reviewed: The patch has been reviewed by Tvrtko Ursulin, which adds credibility to its correctness and effectiveness.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a debug level for channel context in the ath9k driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant functionality or improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a new one. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for setting the `all_device_types` field when restoring the persistent state in the `pulse8-cec` driver. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be addressing a potential issue with the `all_device_types` field not being properly filled in during the restoration process. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for proper error handling in the `init_dma_pools()` function in the `amd5536udc` driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds proper error handling for the case when `dev->data_requests` is not allocated successfully. Instead of setting `retval` and jumping to the `finished` label, it directly returns `-ENOMEM`. This change improves error reporting and avoids unnecessary code execution.

2. The patch also adds proper error handling for the case when `dev->stp_requests` is not allocated successfully. Instead of setting `retval` and jumping to the `finished` label, it jumps to the `err_create_dma_pool` label, which handles the cleanup and error reporting.

3. Similarly, the patch adds proper error handling for the case when `td_stp` is not allocated successfully. Instead of setting `retval` and jumping to the `finished` label, it jumps to the `err_alloc_dma` label, which handles the cleanup and error reporting.

4. The patch also adds proper error handling for the case when `td_data` is not allocated successfully. Instead of setting `retval` and jumping to the `finished` label, it jumps to the `err_alloc_phys` label, which handles the cleanup and error reporting.

5. In the error handling code paths, the patch properly frees the allocated resources and sets the corresponding pointers to `NULL`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue by improving error handling in the `init_dma_pools()` function. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return values of tiocmget and tiocmset functions in the ftdi_sio driver. The patch includes changes to handle USB-internal error codes and translate them to appropriate return values for userspace.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for handling return values correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves performance by using the `ipv6_addr_any()` helper function instead of `ipv6_addr_type()` to determine if an address is an IPv6 any address. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary NULL checks before calling the release_firmware() function. Since the release_firmware() function can handle NULL pointers gracefully, the explicit tests before the call are indeed pointless.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, it does not introduce any significant improvements or changes.

Hence, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary line break in the show_scaling_cur_freq() function in the cpufreq.c file. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "static" keyword to the "DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE" macro in the i915 driver. This change is made to silence a warning from the sparse tool about the global variable not being declared static.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve converting the wm8776 codec driver to use table-based control and DAPM initialization.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds two new registers, `rimsc` and `fimsc`, to the `struct nmk_gpio_chip` in the `gpio-nomadik.c` file. These registers are used to cache values from the GPIO controller.

2. In the `__nmk_gpio_set_mode_safe` function, instead of reading the values from the GPIO controller, the patch uses the cached values `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the `nmk_chip` structure. This change improves performance by avoiding unnecessary reads from the hardware.

3. In the `__nmk_gpio_irq_modify` function, the patch introduces changes to handle different types of interrupts (`WAKE` and `NORMAL`). It updates the `rimsc` and `fimsc` registers based on the interrupt type and the enable/disable flag. The patch also uses the cached values `rimscval` and `fimscval` from the `nmk_chip` structure instead of reading from the hardware.

4. In the `nmk_gpio_wakeups_suspend` function, the patch removes the unnecessary reads of `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the GPIO controller. Instead, it uses the cached values `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the `nmk_chip` structure to update the registers.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a performance optimization by caching register values. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the Linux kernel. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

This patch seems to be adding functionality to parse out the ECC information for the full-id NAND chips. While it may be a useful enhancement, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address any critical issues or bugs.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes some local functions and replaces them with existing helper functions. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a parameter from the function s_cbFillTxBufHead in the vt6655 driver. The patch replaces the usage of the parameter *pPacket with the locally available skb->data. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adds the "const" qualifier to the "ab8500_cell" structure in the "db8500_prcmu_register_ab8500" function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup. As per the guidelines, patches with trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the uvcvideo driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations for the videobuf2 queue, moving the video enable/disable code to these operations.

The patch also includes changes to the uvc_queue_enable function, removing the video enable/disable calls and moving them to the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations.

Overall, this patch seems to address a real issue related to stream start/stop control in the uvcvideo driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability and does not introduce any functional changes. It changes the return type of the function `is_file_hugepages()` from `int` to `bool` and simplifies the implementation by removing an unnecessary if condition.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the "frontend" extra MSR on Skylake in the JSON conversion. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a POSTING_READ macro call to keep the cached values in sync with the hardware. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an interface to get the DMA frame and instruction buffer (IB) size for the amdgpu ring. This can be useful for properly calculating space on the ring for IB submissions.

Since this patch does not seem to fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "__always_unused" attribute to the "filter_mask" parameter in the "i40e_ndo_bridge_getlink" function. This change indicates that the "filter_mask" parameter is intentionally unused and avoids compiler warnings.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a single line of code to acknowledge the TX done interrupt in "level mode" for the nps_enet driver. While this may be necessary for certain simulators of the device, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an endian bug in the cpufreq cooling code. The bug causes incorrect values to be stored in the high bits of an unsigned long on big endian systems. 

The patch changes the data type of the "count" variable from unsigned long to unsigned int to ensure correct storage of values. It also updates the function call to "get_property" to pass the address of the "count" variable correctly.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can lead to incorrect behavior on big endian systems, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a global variable and moves it into the errata configuration function. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add soft reset controller support for STiH415 and includes new softreset lines required for other device tree nodes in the header file. However, it does not specify any real and critical bug that it fixes or any issues it addresses.

To make a decision, I would need more information about the purpose and impact of this patch. Specifically, I would need to know if it addresses any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more details or context about the patch so that I can make an informed decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of the hash function in the sch_fq.c file.
2. The patch replaces the existing hash_32() function with hash_ptr() for 64-bit architectures.
3. The reason for this change is that the author, Eric Dumazet, initially chose hash_32() due to performance issues with hash_ptr() on 64-bit architectures.
4. However, Linus Torvalds and George Spelvin have fixed the performance issues with hash_ptr(), making it a better choice for 64-bit architectures with large amounts of memory.
5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and also includes Cc to Hugh Dickins.
6. The patch modifies the fq_classify() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the fq_root array.
7. The patch also modifies the fq_rehash() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the new_array.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a performance issue and improving the hash function usage on 64-bit architectures with large memory sizes. It does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: arche-apb: Don't use gpio after failing to request it." This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to the greybus driver for the arche-apb controller.

2. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from the author, Viresh Kumar, and a reviewed-by line from Vaibhav Hiremath. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review.

3. The patch modifies the `apb_ctrl_init_seq` function in the `arche-apb-ctrl.c` file.

4. In the `apb_ctrl_init_seq` function, there is a call to `devm_gpio_request` to request a specific GPIO pin (`apb->clk_en_gpio`) for the APB clock enable. If the `devm_gpio_request` call returns an error, the patch handles the failure by printing a warning message.

5. After the `devm_gpio_request` call, there is a check for the return value. If the return value indicates an error, the patch prints a warning message and does not proceed with setting the direction of the GPIO pin.

6. If the `devm_gpio_request` call succeeds, the patch sets the direction of the GPIO pin to output. If this operation fails, the patch prints a warning message.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of GPIO pins in the greybus driver for the arche-apb controller. It ensures that the direction of the GPIO pin is not set if the initial request fails. This fix prevents potential issues that could arise from using a GPIO pin that was not successfully requested.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or potential issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `fuse_file_fallocate()` function in the `fs/fuse/file.c` file.

2. The change replaces the line `struct inode *inode = file->f_inode;` with `struct inode *inode = file_inode(file);`.

3. The `file_inode()` function is used to obtain the `inode` pointer from the `file` structure. This function is preferred over directly accessing `file->f_inode` as it provides better code readability and maintainability.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves code readability without introducing any functional changes or fixing any real and critical bugs. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ath9k: Check beaconing mode properly"
   - The patch aims to improve the beaconing mode check in the ath9k driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - In MCC (Multiple Concurrent Channels) mode, the Timestamp (TSF) of a context needs to be adjusted only if it is a Group Owner/Access Point (GO/AP).
   - The patch adds a check to return early if the previous channel does not require a switch after the beacon.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 260: Adds a check to return early if the previous channel does not require a switch after the beacon.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the beaconing mode check in the ath9k driver. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or any other critical issues. Additionally, I would need to know if the fix introduces any regressions or has been tested thoroughly.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that upgrades the sched_clock interface from 32-bit to 64-bit. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed functions that automatically handle resource cleanup. This helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve using devm_kzalloc() to allocate memory and devm_hwmon_device_register() to register the hwmon device. These changes are not trivial and can potentially fix real and critical bugs.

The patch also includes error handling and cleanup code, which is important for maintaining code integrity and preventing resource leaks.

Overall, the patch seems to address a real issue and improves the code by using managed functions and proper error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary function call. The removed function call, i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div(), is already called in the do_cmdtest() function and sets the required values for the dev_private structure. Therefore, calling it again in the do_cmd() function is redundant.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. As per the guidelines, trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the use of typedef ctl_table to struct ctl_table. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new definitions for ATPX in the AMDGPU driver. These definitions include ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only adds new definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential deadlock issue related to memory reclaim and workqueue flushing. The patch adds a new function called "check_flush_dependency" which verifies that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or its work items while reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue without WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

The patch also adds a call to "check_flush_dependency" in the "flush_workqueue" function to ensure the dependency sanity before flushing the workqueue.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential deadlock issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the FPU type for ColdFire MMU platforms. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not introduce any significant functional changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the incorrect use of `sizeof` in the `rtsx_probe()` function in the `rtsx.c` file of the staging driver for the rts5208 device. The patch replaces `sizeof(dev->chip)` with `sizeof(*dev->chip)` to correctly allocate memory for the `dev->chip` structure.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `handle_IRQ` with `handle_domain_irq` in the `sa1100_handle_irq` function. This change is aimed at automatically mapping the hardware IRQ number to a virtual IRQ.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a bug reported in the bug tracker (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65256). This indicates that there is a real issue that needs to be fixed.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues. However, it is possible that the phantom LVDS header could cause unexpected behavior or misconfiguration, which could potentially lead to issues like data corruption or system instability.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It adds a new DMI entry to handle the specific issue on the Intel D525MW mainboard.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, it is important to note that further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers is necessary to ensure the patch is correct and does not introduce any regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the verbosity of the debugging output in the turbostat tool. It modifies the dump_cnt() function to only print the counters that are active, rather than printing all counters regardless of their value.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch are related to the return value of seq_printf and converting it to check seq_has_overflowed instead. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to debug logs in the Bluetooth subsystem. The issue is that the expected and actual key counts were mixed up in the debug logs. The patch corrects this by swapping the values in the log messages.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause confusion or misinterpretation of debug logs, it can be considered a valid fix. However, it does not seem to fix a critical issue that causes a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix for an issue that could potentially cause confusion. As such, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for improving the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the tas5086 codec driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the function `tas5086_set_deemph` in the `tas5086.c` file of the sound/soc/codecs directory.

2. It introduces a loop that iterates over the `tas5086_deemph` array to find a match for the `priv->rate` value.

3. If a match is found, the loop breaks and assigns the index `i` to the `val` variable.

4. The `val` variable is then used to update certain bits in the `TAS5086_SYS_CONTROL_1` register using `regmap_update_bits`.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a minor improvement in the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a configuration option related to DMA in the addi-data drivers. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the function `comedi_driver_unregister()` to call `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` instead of `comedi_dev_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver. This change increments the reference count to prevent the device from being removed while it is being checked to see if it is attached to the driver.

2. After the check, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

3. The patch also includes the necessary sign-offs from the authors.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a potential issue related to device removal while being checked for attachment to the driver. It ensures that the reference count is properly managed to prevent any potential issues.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a generic compatible string for the "hix5hd2" SoC name, which improves the clarity and compatibility of the ethernet driver.

2. The patch updates the "compatible" property to include the SoC strings "hisilicon,hix5hd2-gemac" and "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-gemac", as well as the version strings "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v1" and "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v2". This ensures that the driver is compatible with different versions of the SoC.

3. The patch updates the driver name from "hix5hd2-gmac" to "hisi-gemac", which reflects the generic nature of the driver.

4. The patch adds definitions for hardware capabilities and gemac versions, which can be used for future enhancements or feature differentiations.

5. The patch updates the module description to "HISILICON Gigabit Ethernet MAC driver", which provides a more accurate and descriptive name for the driver.

Overall, the patch improves compatibility, clarity, and maintainability of the ethernet driver for the "hix5hd2" SoC. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters in the cxgb4 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial change that adds device IDs to the driver's PCI device table.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the onyx and tas codec drivers to use the `module_i2c_driver()` macro. This change makes the code smaller and simpler, but it does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics in the amdgpu driver. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: Reorder i915_params fields to not create holes." This suggests that it aims to reorder the fields in the i915_params structure to avoid creating any holes.

2. Looking at the patch, we can see that it reorders the fields in the i915_params structure. Specifically, it moves the "enable_hangcheck" and "fastboot" boolean fields to the end of the structure, after the "invert_brightness" integer field.

3. The patch also adds a comment stating that the boolean fields are left at the end to avoid creating holes.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code cleanup or optimization change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing register settings for the SRC_O_BUSIF_MODE in the ASoC rsnd driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the IS_ERR_OR_NULL macro instead of explicitly checking for NULL and IS_ERR separately. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the nfsd (NFS server) code in the Linux kernel. It adds reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op and makes some modifications to the nfsd4_open_downgrade and nfsd4_lock functions.

Based on the provided patch, it is difficult to determine if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. The patch does not provide any clear indication of a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical problem.

Without more context or information about the bug being fixed, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the information provided, it seems that this patch may not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a whitespace cleanup and symbol visibility change in the `drivers/crypto/dcp.c` file. It makes the `global_dev` symbol static and changes the visibility of two functions, `dcp_dma_unmap` and `dcp_watchdog`, to static as well.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only contains trivial fixes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a local variable 'status' and simplifies the code by removing an unnecessary check. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the 'data' parameter in the fsnotify() function and related function signatures. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a bug related to the blackfin architecture's clock driver. It specifically addresses the issue of clk_round_rate() returning a negative error code instead of 0 upon an error.

2. The rationale for the change is explained in the patch description. The return type of clk_round_rate() is being changed to an unsigned type to accommodate clock sources that can generate rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.

3. The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The actual code change is straightforward and does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The bug being fixed does not fall into the category of build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it does address an issue that can potentially cause incorrect behavior or unexpected results, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a non-trivial issue, and it does not introduce any unnecessary changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects some kerneldoc typos and adjusts the function declaration for consistency. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains trivial fixes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces open-coded SPI transfer with the spi_sync_transfer() helper function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The change replaces the variable "mute_led_nid" with "cap_mute_led_nid" in the function alc269_fixup_hp_cap_mic_mute_hook().

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that turns off the voltage for thermistors when the ADC conversion is initiated. This change is aimed at saving power. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the MPL3115 pressure sensor driver in the IIO subsystem. The patch adds the use of claim/release helper functions to ensure that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: Yes, it fixes a potential issue where the driver was checking for direct mode but not locking it, which could lead to incorrect behavior during raw reads.

2. The bug causes a critical issue: No, the bug does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

3. The patch contains only non-trivial fixes: Yes, the patch introduces changes to claim and release direct mode during raw reads, which is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While it addresses a bug, it does not fix a critical issue as defined by the criteria. However, it may still be suitable for inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel or other development branches.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup of error codes in the hv.c file in the staging directory. The patch changes the return values from -1 to specific error codes, such as -EMSGSIZE and -ENOMEM.

Since this patch only involves error code cleanup and does not fix any real and critical bugs, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue of dropped characters at close in the sierra USB serial driver. The patch adds the implementation of the `sierra_chars_in_buffer` function, which calculates the number of characters in the buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBS (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue of dropped characters, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the visibility of a structure declaration. The change from "struct snd_soc_aux_dev rx51_aux_dev[]" to "static struct snd_soc_aux_dev rx51_aux_dev[]" suggests that the intention is to limit the visibility of the "rx51_aux_dev" structure to the current file.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

2. It introduces a new macro `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the intervals.

3. The `INTERVALS` macro is defined as `(1UL << INTERVAL_SHIFT)`, which calculates the number of intervals based on the shift value.

4. In the `get_typical_interval` function, the patch checks if the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`. If true, it performs a right shift of `avg` and `stddev` by `INTERVAL_SHIFT` bits instead of using `do_div`.

5. The patch then calculates the standard deviation by summing the squared differences between the intervals and the average interval.

6. Finally, the patch checks if the standard deviation is small compared to the average interval to determine the typical interval.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It improves the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor and introduces a more efficient way of calculating intervals using shifts instead of `do_div` when the divisor is a power of two. This change does not fall under the category of "trivial" fixes and can potentially address real and critical bugs or issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the uprobes/x86 code.
2. The patch ensures that if the ->pre_xol() hook fails, the task's state is not changed, and the error is returned to allow for proper restart.
3. The patch includes a Signed-off-by line, indicating that the author has agreed to the patch's inclusion.
4. The patch has been reviewed by Jim Keniston and the arch/x86/kernel/uprobes.c code.
5. The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, but rather address a real issue in the code.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver. Instead, it suggests determining the value of 'ai_continuous' from the cmd->stop_src member.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the 'ai_continuous' member is no longer being used or referenced anywhere in the driver. The patch also introduces a new variable 'cmd' to access the comedi_cmd structure.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the removal of 'ai_continuous' does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the changes made by the patch seem to fall under the category of "trivial" fixes, as they involve removing an unused member and introducing a new variable.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes the prototype of the `libcfs_ioctl` function in `libcfs.h` to match its definition in `libcfs/module.c`. This indicates that there was a mismatch between the declaration and definition of the function.

2. The patch is signed-off by Aleksei Fedotov and Acked-by James Simmons. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The change in the patch is a modification to the function prototype, specifically changing the type of the `arg` parameter from `void *` to `void __user *`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to user-space pointer handling.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a real bug related to the `libcfs_ioctl` function prototype. The change is not trivial and could potentially lead to issues such as build errors or data corruption if left unaddressed. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces no functional changes or addresses any critical bugs. The patch only introduces a local variable `ops` to store `rdev->desc->ops`, which is then used in subsequent code blocks.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only contains a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is not addressing any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it would be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the powergating logic in the AMDGPU driver for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU family. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code." This suggests that it is refining the power management code for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block on CI GPUs.

2. The patch includes a "Fix up the powergating logic" comment, indicating that there was an issue with the powergating logic that needed to be addressed.

3. The patch is signed-off by Rex Zhu and has an Ack-by from Tom St Denis, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch also has a Reviewed-by tag from Alex Deucher, further indicating that it has been reviewed by another developer.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` function in the `ci_dpm.c` file.

6. The changes in the function include adding powergating state control for the UVD block based on the `gate` parameter. If `gate` is true, the UVD block is stopped and powergated. If `gate` is false, the UVD block is un-gated.

7. The `ci_update_uvd_dpm` function is called after the powergating state is set, regardless of whether it is gated or un-gated.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is fixing a real issue with the powergating logic for the UVD block on CI GPUs. It is not a trivial fix as it involves modifying the powergating state and ensuring the UVD block is properly stopped or un-gated. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a function in the rtl8192e driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function "add_pcie_port" to "dra7xx_add_pcie_port" in the PCI driver for the dra7xx platform. This change is made to avoid name collision in the global namespace.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new feature to the DRM Radeon driver for the Cayman GPU. The patch implements the ability to force a performance level via sysfs. 

While this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it does address a functionality enhancement. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being accepted in a stable release. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for encoding the `flags` field in the `ceph_osd_op` structure. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the bug description, severity, and impact. This information is crucial in determining whether the bug is critical, causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant problems that warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the necessary Kconfig entry to enable the MODULE_TX28 configuration option. This option selects various platform-specific features, including MXS_HAVE_PLATFORM_MXS_MMC. This indicates that the patch is adding support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. This is a functional change and not a trivial fix.

2. The patch also adds a new struct mxs_mmc_platform_data variable named tx28_mmc0_pdata. This structure contains platform-specific data for the MXS MMC device, such as the write-protect GPIO pin and capabilities flags. This indicates that the patch is adding specific configuration for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform.

3. The patch modifies the tx28_stk5v3_init() function to call mx28_add_mxs_mmc() with the newly created tx28_mmc0_pdata structure. This function initializes the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. It does not appear to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the MIPS PNX8550 platform. The warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization data annotation in the prom_getcmdline() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It addresses a section mismatch warning, which is not considered a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch contains a trivial fix by adding the __init annotation to the prom_getcmdline() function. This annotation is used to mark functions that are only used during the initialization phase and are not needed afterwards. While this annotation is necessary for correctness, it falls under the category of a trivial fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: "Staging: hv: Properly handle the error in hv_acpi_init()"
   The title suggests that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - K. Y. Srinivasan <kys@microsoft.com>
   - Haiyang Zhang <haiyangz@microsoft.com>
   - Hank Janssen <hjanssen@microsoft.com>
   - Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

   These lines indicate the authors and contributors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the hv_acpi_init() function in the vmbus_drv.c file.

   - Line 788: The patch adds error handling code after calling vmbus_bus_init(irq).
     If vmbus_bus_init() returns a non-zero value (indicating an error), the patch unregisters the vmbus_acpi_driver using acpi_bus_unregister_driver() and returns the error code.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function. It properly handles the error by unregistering the vmbus_acpi_driver in case of failure. This fix is relevant to the "oh, that's not good" category, as it ensures proper error handling.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file of the hwmon subsystem. The patch modifies some macros for consistency and to improve code readability.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it only addresses smatch warnings, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `list_tail_entry()` with `list_last_entry()` in the `zbud_reclaim_page()` function in `mm/zbud.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a vifs list to the wl12xx driver in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds a new list and initializes it.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the clock data for OMAP4. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant functionality or improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: interface: deactivate interface on enumeration failure". This suggests that it addresses an issue related to the Greybus interface.

2. The patch adds error handling code to deactivate an interface immediately on enumeration failure.

3. The patch includes two "Signed-off-by" lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

4. The code snippet in the patch shows that if the activation of the interface fails, an error message is logged, and the code jumps to the "err_interface_add" label.

5. If the interface activation succeeds, the code proceeds to enable the interface. If enabling the interface fails, an error message is logged, and the code jumps to the "err_interface_deactivate" label.

6. The "gb_interface_add" function is called after the interface activation and enabling steps.

7. The patch adds error handling code to deactivate the interface and then adds it again in case of failure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue by deactivating the interface immediately on enumeration failure. It also includes proper error handling to ensure that the interface is correctly deactivated and added again if necessary.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves correcting the mask defines for certain registers in the WM8900 codec driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The change only modifies the return value of the function `ti_abb_init_table` from `-ENODEV` to `num_entries`. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that uses designated initializers for the irq class array in irq.c. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unnecessary use of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function of the ASoC ux500_pcm driver. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), and it only removes a function call that is not used, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `spin_lock_init()` function call after the error checking for the `kmalloc()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the stability or security of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of pr_err/info functions with dev_err/info functions in the cpufreq driver for Exynos processors. This change aims to provide more accurate log messages with the device name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the function `clk_get()` to `devm_clk_get()` in the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function. This change suggests that the patch is replacing the usage of `clk_get()` with the managed version `devm_clk_get()`. This change is not a trivial fix as it affects the clock handling in the code.

2. The patch removes the `clk_put()` call in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the `clk_put()` call is no longer necessary or has been handled differently. Removing this call could potentially introduce a resource leak if not handled correctly.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code improvement or optimization. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. The reason for marking them as static is that they are not used outside of this file. This improves code organization and reduces the risk of accidental usage or conflicts with other functions.

Additionally, the patch addresses a warning in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file by providing prototypes for the `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` functions. This ensures that the functions are properly declared before they are used, eliminating the warning.

Since the patch fixes a real issue (the warning) and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the start of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the function is only executed when the interrupt mode is enabled. This is a valid optimization and does not introduce any trivial changes.

2. The patch then skips the validation of ring count if they are not going to change. This optimization avoids unnecessary validation when the ring count remains the same. This is also a valid optimization and does not introduce any trivial changes.

3. The patch adds an error message and returns -EINVAL if the adapter does not support RSS/TSS in non MSI-X mode. This is a real issue and a valid error handling mechanism.

4. The patch checks if the `rx_count` has changed and validates the rings accordingly. This is a valid check to ensure the correct number of rings are used.

5. Similarly, the patch checks if the `tx_count` has changed and validates the rings accordingly. This is also a valid check to ensure the correct number of rings are used.

6. The patch removes the check for RSS/TSS support in INT-x and MSI modes. This change removes the error messages and returns -EINVAL for these cases. It is unclear why this change was made, as it seems to remove important error handling for unsupported modes.

Based on the analysis, the patch seems to introduce a regression by removing the error handling for unsupported interrupt modes. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue), and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the bcm_sf2 driver in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch description:
   The patch description explains that during the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use b53_common, a small piece was left untouched where a local copy of the per-port port_vlan_ctl bitmask value was kept. The patch aims to fix this issue by using the value maintained by b53_device instead of the local copy.

2. Fixes tag:
   The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit hash "f458995b9ad8" that introduced the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use the core B53 driver. This indicates that the patch is intended to address a specific issue introduced by that commit.

3. Signed-off-by:
   The patch includes the "Signed-off-by" lines from Florian Fainelli and David S. Miller, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the bcm_sf2_port_setup function in the bcm_sf2.c file. Specifically, it replaces the usage of "priv->port_sts[port].vlan_ctl_mask" with "priv->dev->ports[port].vlan_ctl_mask" in the "reg |= ..." line. This change ensures that the correct vlan_ctl_mask value is used.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the bcm_sf2 driver and fixes an incorrect usage of the vlan_ctl_mask value. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting a stale value that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "mtd: docg3: Don't leak docg3->bbt in error path" and is signed-off by Richard Weinberger and Brian Norris.

2. In the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the error handling path in the `doc_probe_device` function in the `docg3.c` file.

3. The patch changes the `goto nomem3` statement to `goto nomem4` in two places. This means that if the `chip_id` is not equal to its inverse, it will jump to the `nomem4` label instead of `nomem3`.

4. The `nomem4` label is added and it frees the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt` using `kfree`.

5. The `nomem3` label is already present in the code and it frees the memory allocated for `mtd` using `kfree`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential memory leak issue by properly freeing the allocated memory for `docg3->bbt` in the error path. This is not a trivial fix as it addresses a resource management issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p_jpeg_device_run and s5p_jpeg_runtime_resume callbacks. These callbacks alter device registers, which makes it critical to have spin_lock protection.

The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to protect the critical sections of code. This ensures that the device registers are accessed safely in a multi-threaded or interrupt-driven environment.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces "x != NULL" with "x". This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the missing OF module alias information for the ppc4xx_edac platform driver. This fix enables module autoloading for the driver.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix SGL Initialization and posting Pages for Dual Chute". It mentions that the initialization of SGL (Scatter-Gather List) and related page posting is to be done for the chute. It also states that for the BE-X family, the iSCSI protocol is loaded only on a single chute.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by John Soni Jose, Jayamohan Kallickal, and James Bottomley.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the file "drivers/scsi/be2iscsi/be_main.c" and makes the following changes:

   - Line 3450: A loop is added to determine the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) number based on the configuration value of each chute.
   - Line 3946: The ULP number is used to calculate the page offset for SGL initialization.
   - Line 4013: Another loop is added to determine the ULP number.
   - Line 4031: The ULP number is used to calculate the SGL index.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the code changes, it appears that the patch addresses an issue related to SGL initialization and page posting for the be2iscsi driver. It introduces a loop to determine the ULP number and uses it to calculate the necessary offsets and indices. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the issue.

5. Decision:
   Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers before making a decision.

Based on the analysis above, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) until more information is available.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch appears to be related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the nau8825 codec. It aims to improve the jack connection decision logic by considering both active low and active high jack insertion scenarios.

The changes made in the patch include:
- Adding a new variable `active_high` to store the jack polarity information.
- Reading the `NAU8825_REG_JACK_DET_CTRL` register to determine the jack polarity.
- Checking if the jack insertion logic is active high or active low.
- Modifying the return statement to compare the `active_high` value with the `is_high` value.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or enhancement to the existing code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the regulator_ops structure to use the regulator_map_voltage_ascend function instead of the regulator_list_voltage_table function.

Since this change does not fix any critical issue and is considered a trivial fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new member called "allow_runtime_pm" of type bool to the "struct sdhci_pci_fixes" and "struct sdhci_pci_chip" structures. This flag indicates whether runtime PM is allowed for the device.

2. In the "sdhci_intel_mfd_sd", "sdhci_intel_mfd_sdio", and "sdhci_intel_mfd_emmc" structures, the "allow_runtime_pm" flag is set to true, indicating that runtime PM is allowed for these devices.

3. In the "sdhci_pci_probe" function, if the "fixes" member of the "chip" structure is not NULL, the "quirks" and "allow_runtime_pm" members of the "chip" structure are set based on the values in the "fixes" structure.

4. In the same function, if the "allow_runtime_pm" flag is true, the "sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow" function is called to allow runtime PM for the device.

5. In the "sdhci_pci_remove" function, if the "allow_runtime_pm" flag is true, the "sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid" function is called to forbid runtime PM for the device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds support for runtime PM for certain devices in the sdhci-pci driver. Since runtime PM is an important feature for power management and can improve energy efficiency, it can be considered a valuable addition. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. It adds support for handling interrupts for both VCS1 and VCS2 rings. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to handling interrupts for the second BSD ring. However, without further context or details about the bug it fixes, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a real security issue. Additionally, we would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without this additional information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch addresses an issue where the return variable of the function `request_code_segment()` is used uninitialized if the argument `boot_case` is false. The patch fixes this by assigning the return value of `write_blk_fifo()` to the `status` variable.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug or its impact on system stability, security, or functionality.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional information such as the frequency and likelihood of encountering the uninitialized return variable issue, any potential consequences it may have, and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release (e.g., critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue).

Without this additional information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the clock ID for the "pclk_isp_in" clock in the rockchip clk-rk3288.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "blk-mq-sched: check for successful allocation before assigning tag". This suggests that it addresses a potential issue related to the allocation of tags in the blk-mq-sched (block multi-queue scheduler) code.

2. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Bart Van Assche from SanDisk.

3. The patch modifies the code in blk-mq-sched.c, specifically in the blk_mq_sched_get_request() function.

4. In the original code, a request is allocated using the __blk_mq_alloc_request() function, and then the allocated request is assigned to the corresponding tag in the data->hctx->tags->rqs array.

5. The patch adds a check to ensure that the allocation of the request was successful before assigning it to the tag. If the allocation fails (rq is NULL), the assignment is skipped.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue in the blk-mq-sched code by checking for successful allocation before assigning the request to a tag. This could prevent potential issues such as oops, data corruption, or hangs.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the naming for the "micd-timeout" device tree property in the extcon-arizona driver. It adds the time units of -ms (milliseconds) to the property.

2. The patch is signed-off by Charles Keepax and Chanwoo Choi.

3. The patch modifies the "wlf,micd-timeout" property to "wlf,micd-timeout-ms" in the extcon-arizona.c file.

4. The patch updates the device property read function to read the "wlf,micd-timeout-ms" property instead of the previous "wlf,micd-timeout" property.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that updates the naming and adds time units to a device tree property. It does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed off by xiangxiao <xiaoxiang@xiaomi.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@linaro.org>.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the function `snd_soc_jack_add_gpios` in the file `sound/soc/soc-jack.c`.

4. Code analysis: The patch introduces a change in the code where the initial jack status update is delayed using `schedule_delayed_work` function. The delay is set to `gpios[i].debounce_time` using `msecs_to_jiffies` function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is introducing a necessary delay in the initial jack detect process to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. This delay could potentially prevent issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a redundant definition for `pgprot_writecombine`. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that hardcodes the clock event rating to 125 for the CMT driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch removes an explicit memset() call and replaces it with the __GFP_ZERO flag in the krealloc() function. This change initializes the newly allocated memory with zeros.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug, but rather improves code readability or performance, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to microcode handling for AMD processors. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes.
   - This is mentioned explicitly in the patch description.

2. The patch reads the CPUID(1).EAX leaf at the correct CPU and uses it to search the equivalence table for a matching microcode patch.
   - This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to microcode handling.

3. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.
   - It appears to be a targeted fix for microcode handling, rather than addressing any critical bug or issue.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
   - There are no such changes mentioned in the patch.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to missing return statements in the nl802154_add_llsec_key() function. The patch adds a missing return statement to handle the case where certain attributes are not present, returning -EINVAL.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or security issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used in the msi-available-ranges property. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the system. Therefore, this patch addresses a real and critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the bug at hand.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the platform name from "omap-pcm-audio" to "omap-mcbsp.2" in the n810_dai structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming of the platform name.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8994: Make sure we sync DAPM on WM8958 detection mode changes." It appears to address a specific issue related to the WM8958 audio codec driver in the ASoC subsystem.

The patch modifies the `wm8958_mic_detect` function in the `wm8994.c` file. It adds two lines of code to force enable or disable a pin (`CLK_SYS`) in the DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) context and then syncs the DAPM context.

Based on the provided patch and description, it seems that this change ensures that the DAPM context is properly synchronized when the detection mode changes for the WM8958 codec. This synchronization is necessary when the system enables or disables detection at runtime.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or a non-critical improvement.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a sparse warning. The warning itself does not indicate a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the fix does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing call to `i2c_set_clientdata()` in the `mma8450_probe()` function. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to modify the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq` from `unsigned int` to `int`. The reason for this change is that the function may eventually return a negative error code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix related to the return type of a function.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming two repository routines in the powerpc/ps3 code. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the error-handling code of `nes_reg_user_mr()` function in `nes_verbs.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch removes two lines of code that set the current x and y counts to zero. Since there is no explanation or justification provided for this change, it does not seem to fix any specific issue or address any critical bug.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the Intel(R) Trace Hub PCI ID for Broxton SOC. This does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "usb_put_dev". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or optimization rather than addressing a critical problem.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a space before a parenthesis, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. This patch is a whitespace cleanup and does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary calls to usb_get_dev and usb_put_dev. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused constant, OZ_MAX_TIMER_POOL_SIZE. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the email address of the author in the MODULE_AUTHOR field. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate "const" declaration in the ASoC wm8804 driver. This fix addresses a sparse warning related to the duplicate const declaration.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized variable issue in the netpoll_setup function in net/core/netpoll.c. The issue was reported by Fengguang Wu and the patch is signed-off by Cong Wang and David S. Miller.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses a warning about an uninitialized variable.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve moving the allocation of a local variable and removing an unnecessary if statement. These changes do not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the contrast value in the wm8505 framebuffer driver. The original commit had a typo in the contrast value, and this patch corrects it to a more suitable value based on user feedback.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check to only disable the 1.2GHz OPP (Operating Performance Point) for the mx6quad variant.
2. This check is necessary because only the mx6quad variant can run at 1.2GHz.
3. Without this check, a warning is generated on the mx6solo variant when trying to disable the 1.2GHz OPP.
4. The patch is signed-off by Fabio Estevam and Shawn Guo, who are both from Freescale.
5. The patch modifies the file "arch/arm/mach-imx/mach-imx6q.c" at line 320.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a specific issue related to the mx6solo variant and prevents a warning from being generated. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and addresses a real bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to clear the hidden CPU state at reset time in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. It only sets the `vcpu->arch.hflags` to 0, which does not address any significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for reporting whether the interrupt was handled or not in the tda998x driver. The patch introduces a new variable "handled" and sets it to true when certain conditions are met. It then returns IRQ_RETVAL(handled) instead of IRQ_HANDLED, which allows the kernel to report whether the interrupt was actually handled or not.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue with stuck-IRQ problems and prevents the kernel from solidly locking up, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only converts the code to use the new irq_alloc/free_hwirq interface without any functional change. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch converts the i2c core to use the common attach/detach functions for PM domains, extending the support to include the generic PM domain as well. This indicates a change in functionality.

2. The patch is signed-off by Ulf Hansson, reviewed by Kevin Hilman, and acked by Wolfram Sang. It is also reviewed by Dmitry Torokhov and signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki.

3. The changes made in the patch are in the `i2c_device_probe` and `i2c_device_remove` functions.

4. In the `i2c_device_probe` function, the patch replaces the usage of `acpi_dev_pm_attach` and `acpi_dev_pm_detach` with `dev_pm_domain_attach` and `dev_pm_domain_detach`. This change indicates a shift from supporting only ACPI PM domain to supporting the generic PM domain as well.

5. The `dev_pm_domain_attach` function is called with the `true` parameter, indicating that the device should be resumed during the attach operation.

6. The `driver->probe` function is called after the `dev_pm_domain_attach` function. If the probe fails (`status != 0`), the `dev_pm_domain_detach` function is called.

7. In the `i2c_device_remove` function, the patch replaces the usage of `acpi_dev_pm_detach` with `dev_pm_domain_detach`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is introducing a functional change by extending the support for PM domains to include the generic PM domain. Since the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture. It checks if the weak symbol `vpe_run()` is defined or not. If it is not defined (i.e., its value is zero), the patch returns failure early without attempting to load the VPE (Virtual Processing Element).

The patch also includes a warning message when `vpe_run()` is not defined, indicating that the ELF load has failed. This provides useful information for debugging purposes.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a real issue related to the VPE loader.

Overall, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like build errors or data corruption.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "usb: dwc2: host: add function to compare frame index"
   - The patch appears to add a new function to compare frame indexes in the dwc2 USB host driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - The function `dwc2_frame_idx_num_gt` is added to compare frame indexes used for descriptor lists with 64 entries.
   - The function performs a modulo comparison of frame indexes, accounting for rollover when the maximum index is reached.
   - The function returns true if `fr_idx1` is greater than `fr_idx2`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch adds a necessary function to compare frame indexes in the dwc2 USB host driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially address a critical bug or issue related to frame index comparison.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a deprecated and unused operation related to video-level DV timings in the s5p-tv driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for an indentation style issue in the ks7010_sdio.c file. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the dma-range size when the DT attribute is missing. It sets the size to dev->coherent_dma_mask + 1 instead of dev->coherent_dma_mask and adds code to check for invalid values of size configured in DT and log an error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake RAPL in the powercap intel_rapl driver. Gemini Lake RAPL support is stated to be similar to Goldmont.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It should not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

However, the provided patch does not seem to address any specific bug or issue. It appears to be adding support for a new hardware platform (Gemini Lake) in the powercap intel_rapl driver. This does not fall under the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and splitting of the FPU initialization sequence into two parts: one for system initialization and another for per-CPU initialization. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `dev_{get|set}_drvdata` with `spi_{get|set}_drvdata` in the `mrf24j40` driver. This change allows for direct passing of the `struct spi_device` instead of using `&spi->dev`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a NULL comparison style in the code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the MODULE_VERSION macro from the carl9170 driver in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of a cleanup or cosmetic change.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` to the `vce_v3_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function is responsible for setting the bypass mode for VCE 3.0.

2. The `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function reads a register value (`GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL`) using the `RREG32_SMC` macro and stores it in a temporary variable `tmp`.

3. If the `enable` parameter is true, the function sets the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit in the `tmp` variable using the bitwise OR operator. Otherwise, it clears the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit using the bitwise AND operator.

4. Finally, the function writes the modified `tmp` value back to the register using the `WREG32_SMC` macro.

5. The `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function in the same file checks if the `adev->asic_type` is `CHIP_POLARIS10` and calls the `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function with the `enable` parameter based on the `state` parameter.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary function to set the bypass mode for VCE 3.0 on the specified AMD GPU. This functionality is specific to the CHIP_POLARIS10 ASIC type. Since it addresses a specific hardware feature and does not seem to introduce any new issues, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to initializing the "tokens" and "ctokens" variables correctly in the htb_change_class function in the sch_htb.c file. The patch converts the values from ticks to nanoseconds using the PSCHED_TICKS2NS macro.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses an issue with incorrect initialization of variables, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or performance problems. While it may not be a critical bug, it can be considered a bug that needs fixing.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not seem to address any of these issues directly. It is more focused on correctness and performance.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to variable initialization.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. However, the final decision ultimately rests with the maintainers and reviewers of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: [SCSI] pm80xx: Fix for 32 bit compilation warning

4. Code changes:
   - Line 424: A typecast is added to the "memvirtaddr" variable to avoid a compilation warning on 32-bit systems.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a compilation warning on 32-bit systems. It does not fix a critical bug, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any real security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference error in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds a NULL check for the 'match' variable before using it. 

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch converts the control and DAPM initialization in the ASoC wm8940 codec driver to a table-based approach. It replaces the existing audio_map with wm8940_dapm_routes and wm8940_dapm_widgets.

Looking at the changes, it seems that the patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup, converting the control and DAPM initialization to a more structured table-based approach.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and contains only a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "drm_framebuffer_funcs" argument in two functions: "drm_fb_cma_alloc()" and "drm_fbdev_cma_create_with_funcs()". 

Since this patch only adds the "const" qualifier to function arguments, it does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve existing functionality.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add the ability to defer skb freeing in the net_sched module. This change aims to address issues related to TX/RX freezes and latency spikes caused by freeing skbs under locks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, it aims to fix TX/RX freezes and latency spikes caused by freeing skbs under locks.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: Yes, the bug causes TX/RX freezes and latency spikes, which can significantly impact system performance.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a new function, rtnl_kfree_skbs(), and modifies existing functions to utilize it.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to properly starting and stopping the phy device in the mv643xx_eth driver. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, it addresses a real and critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on the bug fix.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only replaces a couple of lines of code with a helper function, which calculates a multiplier value from wMaxPacketSize. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for cleaning up coding style issues in the clk-bcm2835.c file. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a code style warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only replaces the usage of `call->conn->params.peer` with `call->peer` in multiple places. This change is not related to fixing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a macro from "RSND_GEN2_SRU" to "RSND_GEN2_SCU". This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity or consistency purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the file `fs/proc/kcore.c` and specifically focuses on the `elf_kcore_store_hdr` function. The change is as follows:

```diff
-	strncpy(prpsinfo.pr_psargs, saved_command_line, ELF_PRARGSZ);
+	strlcpy(prpsinfo.pr_psargs, saved_command_line, sizeof(prpsinfo.pr_psargs));
```

The patch replaces the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy` to copy the `saved_command_line` string into `prpsinfo.pr_psargs`. The `strlcpy` function ensures that the destination string is always null-terminated, even if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.

Now, let's evaluate whether this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? - No, this patch does not fix a bug. It is a code improvement to ensure proper null termination.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? - No, this patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? - No, this patch does not address a security vulnerability.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue? - No, this patch does not fix any problematic behavior.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? - No, this patch does not involve trivial changes like spelling or whitespace.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a struct and associated variable names. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: staging: comedi: ni_atmio16d: use comedi_buf_write_samples()
   - The patch title suggests that the patch is related to the staging driver for the National Instruments ATMIO16D device in the Comedi subsystem.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch aims to improve the aesthetics of the code by using the comedi_buf_write_samples() function to add a sample to the async buffer.

3. Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off-by H Hartley Sweeten and reviewed-by Ian Abbott, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change replaces the line `comedi_buf_put(s, inw(dev->iobase + AD_FIFO_REG));` with the following lines:
     ```
     val = inw(dev->iobase + AD_FIFO_REG);
     comedi_buf_write_samples(s, &val, 1);
     ```
     This change reads a value from the device's input register and writes it to the async buffer using the comedi_buf_write_samples() function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a trivial code improvement for aesthetics.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to selecting only devices with active links in the staging/rdma/hfi1 driver. The patch introduces a new function `usable_device` that checks if a device is available for general use by verifying if the driver link state is active. The patch then modifies the `get_user_context` function to only consider devices that are active when assigning a user context.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical issue related to device availability and ensures that only active devices are used, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch exports the function `ioremap_nocache` in the CRIS architecture. The function `ioremap_nocache` is used to map physical addresses to virtual addresses for memory-mapped I/O operations. 

Based on the provided patch, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It appears to be a trivial change that exports the `ioremap_nocache` function.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release, I would classify it as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style issue flagged by checkpatch.pl. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "staging: rtl8712: Remove unnecessary cast on void pointer"
   - This indicates that the patch aims to remove an unnecessary cast on a void pointer.

2. Coccinelle script:
   - The Coccinelle script is used to detect instances of unnecessary casts in the code.

3. Patch changes:
   - The patch modifies the code in the file "drivers/staging/rtl8712/usb_ops_linux.c" at line 334.
   - It replaces the cast on the "priv" variable from "(struct _adapter *)" to just "priv".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is removing an unnecessary cast on the "priv" variable. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary casts), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that makes the function `lp8727_ctrl_switch()` inline. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that clarifies variable names and prepares for further checks. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to releasing the rtnl_lock on error paths in the enic_change_mtu_work() function in the enic_main.c file of the enic driver. 

The patch adds rtnl_unlock() calls before returning on two error paths. This ensures that the rtnl_lock is released properly in case of errors during the execution of the function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug by properly releasing the rtnl_lock, it can be considered a valid fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it ensures two channels are clocked for I2S mode, as I2S requires stereo clocking even for mono data.

2. The patch modifies the `arizona_hw_params` function in the `arizona.c` file.

3. The patch introduces a new variable `val` to store the value read from the ARIZONA_AIF_FORMAT register.

4. The patch checks if the number of channels in the `params` structure is 1 and if the ARIZONA_AIF1_FMT_MASK bit is set in `val`. If both conditions are true, it means that mono data is being used in I2S mode.

5. If the conditions in step 4 are met, the patch prints a debug message and updates the `bclk_target` variable to double its value.

6. Finally, the patch iterates through an array of supported rates and checks if the calculated `bclk_target` is greater than or equal to the current rate and if it is a multiple of the `params_rate`. This loop is used to find the appropriate rate for the bit clock (bclk).

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to I2S mode and ensures that stereo clocking is used even for mono data. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces logic to handle the specific case of mono data in I2S mode.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it has been thoroughly tested and does not introduce any regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for an additional token, "ubi_num," to the UBI command line API. This token allows for adding UBI volumes with specific numbers. 

Analyzing the patch against the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? No, it does not fix a bug but rather adds a new feature to the UBI command line API.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? No, it does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does the patch address a real security issue? No, it does not address a security issue.

4. Does the patch fix an "oh, that's not good" issue? No, it does not fix any such issue.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? No, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug. The patch mainly involves caching the current cdclk frequency in the dev_priv structure and renaming the vlv_update_cdclk function to intel_update_cdclk. These changes do not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the SMFC module enable/disable helpers from ipu-common.c to ipu-smfc.c. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/radeon: set power control in ci dpm enable" and is signed-off by Alex Deucher <alexander.deucher@amd.com>. This indicates that it is intended to address a specific issue related to power control in the Radeon driver.

2. The patch adds a call to the function "ci_power_control_set_level(rdev)" in the "ci_dpm_enable" function. This suggests that the patch is introducing a new power control mechanism for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU series.

3. The patch checks the return value of "ci_power_control_set_level(rdev)" and returns an error if it fails. This indicates that the patch is handling potential failure scenarios.

4. The patch also enables auto-throttling based on thermal conditions and updates the current power state.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new power control mechanism for the CI GPU series and handling potential failure scenarios. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch seems to be more of an enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to fix a detection issue for some boards in the BCM47XX MIPS architecture. It addresses a problem where the nvram reset performed from CFE sometimes does not contain the productid value in nvram but still contains the hardware_version.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it adds specific board types and their corresponding hardware versions to the bcm47xx_board_list_hardware_version array. These additions seem to be necessary to correctly identify and handle the affected boards.

Based on the provided information, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a specific board detection fix.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to export the I2C table for the lirc_zilog driver. This change allows udev to auto load the correct module when the device is added.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the usage of the `plane->fb` pointer in the watermark code of the `drm/i915` driver. The patch replaces `plane->fb` with `plane->state->fb` to ensure that the calculations are based on the correct framebuffers.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect calculations and potentially impact the functionality of the driver, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it changes the visibility of the function `register_disk()` from global to static. This means that the function can only be accessed within the same source file, `block/genhd.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a sparse warning by making the function `digital_tg_send_sensf_res()` static. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a debug entry for GCA configuration data in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes changes to the amdgpu_device.c file, adding a new debugfs file operation for reading the GCA configuration data.

Upon analyzing the patch, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new debug feature to the driver.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and contains trivial changes (such as indentation correction and squash in kmalloc fix), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the em28xx-v4l extension in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch moves the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() to the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function.

3. The reason for this change is that currently, these functions are only called when the last user closes the device and the device is already disconnected. However, it is deemed incorrect, and the patch aims to call these functions whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

4. The patch includes a warning message to indicate that the device is open and memory deallocation is deferred on the last close.

5. The patch removes the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() from the em28xx_v4l2_close() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the em28xx-v4l extension and improves the handling of v4l2_ctrl_handler and v4l2_device. The changes appear to be necessary and do not involve trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for fast-xmit in the ath9k driver. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch does not mention any bug or issue that it fixes. It seems to add a new feature or enhancement instead.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only sets the return value to 0 when `master->transfer_one` returns a positive value, and then waits for completion. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to auxtrace data alignment in the perf tools. The patch allows the auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size, which is necessary for certain scenarios like BTS where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing trace statement in the ext4_ext_map_blocks() function. This trace statement is meant to trace blocks punched out when the function is called by punch_hole.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch contains a trivial fix (adding a trace statement) which is not allowed in -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding two new system calls, sched_setattr and sched_getattr, to the microblaze architecture.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the variable "max_buffer_heads" from int to unsigned long. This change is made to prevent potential overflow when calculating the value from nr_free_buffer_pages().

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the "artpec6-pinctrl" driver. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue. The patch allows X.509 certificates to be blacklisted based on their TBSCertificate hash. While this feature may be convenient and align with UEFI's blacklist, it does not address any of the specified criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the deletion of the AP station in the iwlwifi driver. The patch ensures that the station is not deleted directly, but instead marked as unused and relies on the unassociated RXON to drop it from the station database in the device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding accessor functions for the GCR_L2_CONFIG register in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds register accessors.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that marks the function `dwc_dump_chan_regs` as inline. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch is titled "[SCSI] qla2xxx: No fcport FC-4 type assignment in GA_NXT response." This suggests that the patch aims to fix an issue related to the FC-4 type assignment in the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by three individuals, Armen Baloyan, Saurav Kashyap, and James Bottomley. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and approval by these contributors.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the qla2x00_ga_nxt() function in the qla_gs.c file. Specifically, it adds a new line of code to assign the fc4_type based on the value of ct_rsp->rsp.ga_nxt.fc4_types[2].

4. Impact analysis: The patch addresses the issue of not assigning the fc4_type in the GA_NXT response. This could potentially lead to incorrect handling of FC-4 types, which may result in functional issues or data corruption.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to FC-4 type assignment in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential bug in the Linux kernel related to IPv6 packet fragmentation. The patch replaces the existing code that uses `BUG()` to report an error with `BUG_ON()`.

The `BUG_ON()` macro is a debugging aid that checks if a given condition is true and triggers a kernel panic if it is. This helps in identifying and debugging critical issues during development and testing.

In this case, the patch replaces the `BUG()` call with `BUG_ON()` in the `ip6_fragment()` function, specifically in the `skb_copy_bits()` call. This change ensures that if the `skb_copy_bits()` function fails to copy the IP datagram block, it will trigger a kernel panic.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a potential critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the `dvb_unregister_device()` function. Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or optimization.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to clean up the code by moving release handles into fail labels. This is a code organization improvement and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch does not mention any specific bug or issue it addresses.

3. The changes made in the patch do not seem to fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the TWL6030 MFD (Multi-Function Device) driver by implementing the irq_set_wake() function. This function allows TWL6030 client drivers to make use of irq_wake() for waking up the application processor on specific IRQ events.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, this patch seems to be adding a new feature rather than fixing an existing issue.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is reverting the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT on the read syscall path in the perf subsystem. The reason for this change is that it breaks the standard way to read the counter, which is to open the counter, wait for the monitored process to die, and then read the counter.

The patch has been reported by Stephane Eranian and signed-off by Jiri Olsa. It has also been acknowledged by Stephane Eranian and Peter Zijlstra. There are several other individuals who have been copied on the patch for information.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a functional change to revert a check that was causing issues with the standard way of reading the counter.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the hfi1_query_qp function is being removed from the staging/rdma/hfi1/qp.c file. The function is then no longer being used in the codebase.

Since the patch removes a function that is not being used, it does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it does not introduce any new issues and helps to clean up the codebase by removing unused code.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to prevent accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it has been reset. This is necessary because when the kernel reboots, the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called. The buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler, so it should not be updated if it has been reset.

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch involve modifying the bfin_serial_dma_tx_int() function in the bfin_uart.c file. The following changes are made:
   - The line "xmit->tail = (xmit->tail + uart->tx_count) & (UART_XMIT_SIZE - 1);" is removed.
   - The line "uart->port.icount.tx += uart->tx_count;" is retained.
   - The removed line is now placed inside an if condition, which checks if the xmit circular buffer is not empty.
   - The if condition is followed by the code that was previously present after the removed line.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it has been reset. It ensures that the buffer tail is not updated if it has been reset. This fix is important to prevent potential issues such as data corruption or hangs.

4. Decision:
   Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or hangs. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a thorough review of the code and testing in the relevant environment is always recommended before accepting any patch.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch titled "ARM: i.MX5x clocks: Add EPIT support" adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem. It introduces new clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2 and registers them with the clock device framework.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to be adding necessary clock support for the EPIT hardware on the i.MX5x platform. This is not a trivial fix as it involves adding new clock gates and registering them with the clock device framework.

However, based on the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch fixes any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be an enhancement or addition of functionality rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, based on the given information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to updating the scan response data in the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch updates the correct variables (`scan_rsp_data_len` and `scan_rsp_data`) instead of mistakenly updating the advertising data variables (`adv_data_len` and `adv_data`).

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption in the Bluetooth subsystem, it meets the criteria for being accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to convert the usage of `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` in the `bond_debugfs.c` file of the bonding driver. This change improves consistency and allows for better integration with the networking subsystem.

The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing a warning message related to the registration and reregistration of the bonding device to the debugfs filesystem.

The change from `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` ensures that the warning message is associated with the specific network device (`bond->dev`) rather than being a generic warning. This can be helpful for debugging and identifying the specific device causing the issue.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue with the debugfs registration process in the bonding driver and improves the clarity of warning messages. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like build errors, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the declaration of the "decon_crtc_ops" structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix in terms of adding a qualifier to the structure declaration.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the `mask_pos` correctly in the PCI subsystem. The original code incorrectly calculated the value of `mask_pos` based on the `control` and `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` values.

The patch modifies the code to correctly calculate `mask_pos` based on the `control` value. It uses a conditional statement to check if `control` has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set. If it does, `mask_pos` is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, otherwise it is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this bug causes any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is not mentioned if this fix is non-trivial or if it only involves whitespace changes.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. More context about the bug and its impact would be necessary to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a version update for the tg3 driver in the Linux kernel. However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is simply updating the version number and release date.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, it should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the `builtin_platform_driver()` helper. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to use drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence in the msm_atomic_commit() function.

2. Purpose: The purpose of using drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() is to avoid overwriting plane_state->fence if the user has already set an explicit fence.

3. Cc, Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by: The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the msm_atomic_commit() function by introducing a new variable, "fence," and using drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane_state.

5. Analysis: The patch appears to address a specific issue related to setting the fence in the msm_atomic_commit() function. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it seems to be a functional improvement or optimization.

6. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the usage of a variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to clock aliases in the OMAP2+ ARM architecture. However, without further context or information about the bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug being fixed and any other relevant details to proceed with the analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivarfs driver. The patch correctly changes the return type from ssize_t to size_t to avoid potential sign issues.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to newer versions of gcc and variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch aims to address the issue by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays directly.

However, the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it fixes. It only refers to three bug reports related to the issue. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem being addressed.

Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to fall under the category of "trivial" fixes, as they involve modifying the way arrays are accessed. These changes do not seem to address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to debug information display in the mac80211 module. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" debug information outside the mesh_stats debug group and adds it separately. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to address a sparse warning. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds locking to improve concurrency and prevent potential race conditions.

Since this patch does not address a critical bug and contains a "trivial" fix (adding locking), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses the non-success return paths where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks in certain scenarios, such as when the card isn't ready or when the card is hardware-rfkilled.

The suggested fix includes deallocating the broadcast stations and returning an error code when the card is not ready or when it is hardware-rfkilled. This prevents memory leaks and ensures proper cleanup.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can lead to memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that eliminates the send buffers in the GSI receive QP. This change does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "userns: Convert xenfs to use kuid and kgid where appropriate." This suggests that it aims to convert the xenfs filesystem to use kernel user identifiers (kuid and kgid) where necessary.

2. The patch includes changes to the file "drivers/xen/xenfs/super.c" and the file "init/Kconfig."

3. In the "drivers/xen/xenfs/super.c" file, the patch modifies the "xenfs_make_inode" function. It sets the i_uid and i_gid fields of the inode to GLOBAL_ROOT_UID and GLOBAL_ROOT_GID, respectively. This change ensures that appropriate user identifiers are used.

4. In the "init/Kconfig" file, the patch removes a dependency on XENFS for the UIDGID_CONVERTED configuration option. This suggests that the patch is removing a dependency on XENFS for the UIDGID_CONVERTED feature.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code improvement or a non-critical change.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   - It mentions that this enumeration is used for pipeline power management in the future.
   - It also fixes a documentation bug related to a warning message.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds code to lock the `graph_mutex` before checking if the current graph walk object is large enough.
   - If the current graph walk object is not large enough, a new graph walk object is created and initialized.
   - The old graph walk object is cleaned up, and the new one is assigned to `mdev->pm_count_walk`.
   - The `graph_mutex` is unlocked before returning.

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - It addresses a potential issue related to the size of the graph walk object.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless conditional branch. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes redundant declarations of functions in the perf_event.h header file.

false || Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch description only mentions adding AR9580 support to the ath9k driver, and it includes the necessary changes to the PCI device table.

To make a decision, we need more information about the nature of the bug being fixed, whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases (such as causing a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue), and whether the patch contains any trivial fixes.

Without this additional information, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'i8254_osc_base' data from the boardinfo structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the removed line seems to be a configuration parameter that is the same for all board types.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a wait for one vblank before disabling CRCs in the i915 driver. This change is aimed at avoiding a spurious interrupt warning. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new member `resource` to the `struct drbd_device` in the `drbd_int.h` header file. This member is then assigned a value in the `drbd_create_minor` function in `drbd_main.c` and used in the `drbd_adm_prepare` function in `drbd_nl.c`.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the svcrpc module related to server thread shutdown. The patch adds locking around the traversal of the xprt_list to ensure proper synchronization.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a locking issue that may not have a significant impact on system stability or security.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a code refactoring change that factors out the function `sdhci_set_default_irqs()` from the `sdhci_init()` function in the `sdhci` driver. It also moves the call to `sdhci_set_default_irqs()` to the end of the `sdhci_init()` function.

Based on the provided patch, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that does not have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of the `led_info` structure in the `leds-pca963x.c` file. The patch initializes the `led` structure completely by using the `{}` initializer, which ensures that all fields are properly initialized.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to uninitialized data and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real issue. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this bug causes a critical issue such as a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a helper function called `dwc3_core_fifo_space` to the `dwc3` USB driver. This helper function is used to retrieve the available space in different queues and FIFOs in the `dwc3` controller. The purpose of this helper function is to facilitate debugging and potentially issue remote wakeup when starting a transfer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of a debugging and functionality enhancement patch rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential security issue. The patch reintroduces a check to disallow world-writable files in sysfs. This check was previously removed but is now being reintroduced to ensure that all users are fixed.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a semicolon. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the values of n, m1, and m2 in the code. These values are used for clock calculations in the gma500 driver. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are considered trivial as they do not address any significant issues.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug. The patch only changes the return type of the `drm_pci_agp_init` function from `int` to `void`. This change does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any existing issues. It simply removes the `return 0;` statement from the `drm_pci_agp_init` function, which does not have any impact on the behavior of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch addresses the issue of freeing nf_bridge information after POST_ROUTING, which is only needed for -m physdev. This change ensures that the allocation and freeing of nf_bridge information happen on the same CPU, which can improve performance.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a specific issue related to nf_bridge information.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the Lustre staging driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes warnings related to pointer-to-integer casts and integer-to-pointer casts in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. These warnings occur when compiling a 64-bit kernel.

2. The warnings indicate potential issues with pointer size conversions, which can lead to compatibility problems or undefined behavior.

3. The patch introduces a new macro, IS_DMA_ALIGNED, which checks if a given address is aligned to the DMA_ALIGNMENT value.

4. The patch also modifies the initialization of the null_dma_buf field in the driver_data structure. It replaces the ALIGN macro with PTR_ALIGN, which aligns the address to the DMA_ALIGNMENT value.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the changes are related to warnings and alignment, they address potential compatibility issues and improve the code's robustness.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of hardcoding it to the bit used by current Tegra GPUs. This suggests that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the IOMMU functionality.

2. The patch adds a new member, "iommu_bit," to the "gk20a_instmem" structure. This member will store the IOMMU bit value obtained from the platform data.

3. In the "gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to clear the IOMMU bit instead of hardcoding the specific bit (34) used for unmapping pages.

4. Similarly, in the "gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to set the IOMMU bit instead of hardcoding the specific bit (34) used for resolving addresses through the IOMMU.

5. Finally, in the "gk20a_instmem_new" function, the patch assigns the IOMMU bit value from the platform data to the "iommu_bit" member of the "gk20a_instmem" structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the IOMMU functionality in the "gk20a_instmem" module. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces changes to multiple functions and adds a new member to a structure. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that replaces the module_init and module_exit calls with the module_i2c_driver macro. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the explicit initialization and cleanup functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function callback. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unused code), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a new function `nvme_free_queue_mem()` to free the memory allocated for the admin queue in case of initialization failure. This function is then called in the `nvme_configure_admin_queue()` function when the device is not ready, ensuring that the memory is properly freed before returning an error.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential resource leak and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a valid fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a coding style warning related to void function return statements. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the function `blkdev_mmap()` as static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch allows vendor commands that require the WIPHY_VENDOR_CMD_NEED_RUNNING flag to be sent to the NAN (Neighborhood Aware Networking) interface.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Andrei Otcheretianski, Luca Coelho, and Johannes Berg, who are all from Intel.

3. Code changes: The code changes in the patch modify the nl80211_vendor_cmd function in the nl80211.c file.

4. Code analysis: The patch adds an additional condition to the if statement in the nl80211_vendor_cmd function. The new condition checks if the wireless device (wdev) is not associated with a network device, is not in P2P mode, and is not in NAN mode. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns -ENETDOWN, indicating that the network is down.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch allows vendor commands to be sent to the NAN interface only if the wireless device is not associated with a network device, is not in P2P mode, and is not in NAN mode. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for obtaining the BOS (Binary Object Store) descriptor test scenario for USB 3.0 in the usbtest module. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the usbtest module.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to a dentry leak in the greybus driver. The patch removes the debugfs file and disables USB logging, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue that could lead to resource leaks or other problems.

However, without further context or information about the severity of the bug, it is difficult to determine whether this patch qualifies as a critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not mention any specific build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues that it addresses.

Given the limited information provided, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it seems to address a relatively minor issue related to debugfs dentry leak. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding stub functions for v_sys, refclk, and unipro resource management in the greybus subsystem. These stub functions are currently not implemented and return 0.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only adds stub functions without any implementation, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "dmaengine: edma: kill the tasklets upon exit". It suggests that the driver should ensure that tasklets are killed to prevent them from being executed after the driver is removed.

2. The patch adds a new function called "edma_cleanupp_vchan" which is responsible for cleaning up and killing the vchan tasklets.

3. In the "edma_remove" function, the "edma_cleanupp_vchan" function is called to clean up and kill the vchan tasklets before unregistering the DMA device.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue with tasklets not being properly killed upon driver removal. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes if the tasklets are executed after the driver is removed.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential issue that could cause unexpected behavior or crashes, it can be categorized as fixing an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch title: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: fixup FPGA ioremap area"
   - The patch appears to fix an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - The patch has two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

3. Code changes:
   - Line 42: The variable "fpga" is changed from a static variable to a non-static variable.
   - Line 66: The "fpga" variable is unmapped using the iounmap() function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is fixing an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or falls into the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until more information is available about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the AXP20X and AXP22X battery drivers to the MFD cells of the AXP209, AXP221, and AXP223 MFDs. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds functionality to support battery drivers for specific PMICs.

Since this patch does not address any critical issues and is not fixing a bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply allows NULL or error pointers to be passed unconditionally, which simplifies error paths in drivers that use optional clocks. However, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds definitions for Skylake stepping revision IDs. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "ops" member of the "ds2404" structure. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for unregistering the connector during component removal in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds the necessary calls to unregister and cleanup the connector in the `hdmi_connector_destroy` function.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to component removal and ensures proper cleanup, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. The patch modifies the dwc3_omap_probe function in the dwc3-omap.c file to mark the interrupt handler as shared using the IRQF_SHARED flag. This change is necessary on OMAPs to share the IRQ with the OTG device driver.

Since this patch addresses a critical issue related to interrupt handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria for inclusion.

The patch addresses a bug related to the pageflip finish event for interlace mode in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs. The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison of DMA addresses.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the patch correctly fixes the issue by comparing the base and shadow registers for each window's DMA address. If they are not equal, the patch exits the function, indicating an error.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a flag to indicate that a recovery work was initiated on purpose to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set.

2. The patch modifies the wl1271_recovery_work() function to include a check for the new flag. It uses the BUG_ON() macro to trigger a bug if bug_on_recovery is true and the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is not set.

3. The patch modifies the wl1271_op_add_interface() function to set the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag before initiating the recovery work.

4. The patch modifies the wl1271_op_remove_interface() function to set the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag before queuing the recovery work.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to recovery work in the wl12xx driver. It introduces a new flag to avoid triggering a bug when the recovery work is intentionally initiated. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it involves modifying multiple functions and adding a new flag.

Considering that the patch addresses a real issue related to recovery work and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new sysfs file to show the Latency Tolerance Messaging (LTM) capabilities of USB devices. This does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to the call_usermodehelper_fns() function in the KEYS subsystem. The patch replaces the call to call_usermodehelper_fns() with a combination of call_usermodehelper_setup() and call_usermodehelper_exec() functions.

The patch aims to address a potential problem where the cleanup function may not be called in case of an out-of-memory (OOM) condition. This could result in a missed call to key_put(), which could lead to resource leaks.

Considering the patch addresses a potential bug that could cause data corruption or resource leaks, it falls under the category of fixing a real and critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch moves the initialization of the `rateinfo` structure to a separate helper function called `rateinfo_init()`. This change is done to avoid bloating the main match function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new function `dso__last_symbol()` to find the last symbol in a DSO (Dynamic Shared Object). This function will be used when parsing address filters to calculate a region that includes the entire DSO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? No, it does not fix a bug but rather adds a new function.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? No, it does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? No, it does not address a security vulnerability.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue? No, it does not fix any problematic behavior.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? No, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that made changes to the ARM shmobile emev2 code. The reason for the revert is mentioned as changing the flags of the wrong CPUs, which breaks the bootup of secondary CPUs.

The patch itself does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to the wrong CPU flags, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug and does not address any of the specified issues. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes deprecated usage of the `cpus_` functions in the IA64 architecture. The changes involve replacing the deprecated functions with the corresponding `cpumask_` functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the ACPI device ID array in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a numeric value with a defined constant. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be modifying the nve0_fifo_intr_engine function in the nve0.c file of the nouveau driver. It adds a new function called nve0_fifo_intr_engine, which triggers a specific event when called. This function is then called within the nve0_fifo_intr function.

Based on the provided patch, it seems that the changes are related to handling interrupts in the nve0_fifo_intr function. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional details about the bug being addressed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, we would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without this information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by removing unnecessary comparisons. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it only improves code readability without addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling `schedule_work()`. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the i2c-mxs driver. The bug causes slow scanning of the i2c bus due to the driver ignoring the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit during the busy-waiting loop. The patch adds a check for the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit and returns an error if it is set, which should prevent the slow scanning issue.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the i2c-mxs driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error when the mc138xxx driver is built as a module. The error is related to undefined symbols "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" in the mc13892-regulator.ko module.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the changes in the patch are trivial, as they only export two symbols using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a whitespace before a parenthesis, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch warning. The change only involves reformatting the syslog message to fit within the recommended coding style. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to scheduling while atomic in the sdhci_s3c_set_clock() function. The patch caches the rates of all bus clocks at probe time and then uses those cached values instead of calling clk_get_rate(), which might sleep.

Since this patch addresses a potential scheduling issue and improves the code by avoiding a potentially sleeping function call, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to the initialization of the `mtd_oob_ops` structure in the `nand_base.c` file. The patch initializes the structure using `memset` instead of explicitly setting individual fields to NULL.

The patch also mentions that the ooblen field is not being initialized, but it is not critical since users check if oobbuf is NULL first. However, it is considered good practice to zero out unused fields.

The patch includes a reference to Coverity IDs #200821 and #200822, indicating that the issue was identified by static code analysis.

Overall, the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it addresses an issue that can be considered as "oh, that's not good" and improves code quality by following good practices.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes a "line over 80" issue and resolves a "blank line" issue, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug. The change only involves removing a comment and reordering the lines of code. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change simply moves the assignment of `gpio_base = -1` to an earlier position in the code. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the f2fs filesystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch title suggests that it aims to detect an error in the `update_dent_inode` function during a rename operation in the f2fs filesystem.

2. The patch adds a check to verify the return value of the `update_dent_inode` function after it is called with the `old_inode`, `new_inode`, and `new_dentry->d_name` parameters.

3. If the return value of `update_dent_inode` is non-zero (indicating an error), the patch releases an orphan inode and jumps to the `put_out_dir` label, which handles the error condition.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential error scenario in the f2fs filesystem's rename operation. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new check and handles the error condition appropriately.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues during a rename operation in the f2fs filesystem.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for different MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths. This can be useful for systems that require separate memory regions for transmitting and receiving data.

2. If only one region is specified, it is assumed to be shared between Rx and Tx, ensuring backward compatibility.

3. The patch also assigns the Tx channel to Rx if the MMIO regions are different and Rx is not specified. This ensures that the system can still function with a single channel dealing with both Tx and Rx.

4. The patch modifies the structure `struct mbox_test_device` to include separate `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers for the MMIO regions.

5. The `mbox_test_message_write` function checks if `tx_mmio` and `signal` are not NULL before sending a message through the MMIO region.

6. The `mbox_test_receive_message` function checks if `rx_mmio` is not NULL before receiving a message from the MMIO region.

7. The `mbox_test_prepare_message` function checks if `tx_mmio` is not NULL before preparing a message to be sent through the MMIO region.

8. The `mbox_test_probe` function maps the MMIO regions using `devm_ioremap_resource` and assigns the mapped regions to `tx_mmio` and `rx_mmio` pointers.

9. If the Rx channel is not specified but there is a separate Rx MMIO region, the patch assigns the Rx channel to the Tx channel.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds functionality to support separate Tx and Rx MMIO regions and handles the case where only one region is specified. It also ensures backward compatibility and assigns the appropriate channels based on the MMIO regions. This patch does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a line over 80 characters warning detected by the checkpatch.pl script. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the code. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for an inconsistency issue in the wakeup path of the fair scheduler. The patch ensures that the use of `prev_cpu` is consistent throughout the code by passing it as an argument to the relevant helper functions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses an inconsistency issue, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does not seem to meet the criteria for being included in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "ALSA: fireworks: Fix wrong value as an argument for PTR_ERR()". It suggests a fix for a specific driver in the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) subsystem, specifically the fireworks driver.

The patch addresses a bug related to the handling of the return value of the memdup_user() function. In the original code, the return value of memdup_user() is assigned to the 'buf' variable, but if an error occurs, the incorrect 'data' variable is passed to PTR_ERR(). This is a mistake, as the correct variable to pass is 'buf'.

The fix in the patch correctly assigns the return value of memdup_user() to 'buf' and passes 'buf' to PTR_ERR() in case of an error. This ensures that the correct error value is returned.

The bug fixed by this patch does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption. However, it can be considered a "real and critical bug" as it involves incorrect error handling, which can lead to incorrect error reporting or handling in the code.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue and provides a necessary fix.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring patch that improves code readability by breaking up the handle_cmd_completion() function into smaller functions. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "_single" suffix from the page table allocator function names. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the parameter 'dma_mask' to 'max_addr' in the blk_queue_bounce_limit() function. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional change.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary variable initialization in the `d40_probe()` function of the `ste_dma40.c` driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing an unnecessary initialization), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue occurs when Q_GETNEXTQUOTA is called for a filesystem with quotas disabled, causing an oops. This bug can lead to unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes the problem: It adds an early check to determine whether the filesystem has quotas enabled. If quotas are not enabled, the function returns -ESRCH, indicating that the filesystem does not support quotas.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on fixing the critical bug and does not include any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

4. The patch does not introduce any new issues: It does not modify any existing functionality or introduce any potential regressions.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a change related to ACPI Power Management Timer (PM Timer) in the ACPICA subsystem. The patch makes the PM Timer optional, aligning with ACPI 5.0A specifications.

Since the change doesn't directly affect Linux and doesn't fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated function `simple_strtoul` with the recommended function `kstrtoul`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an extra variable declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for whitespace issues in the `spidev_test` file. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch increases the timeout for aborting transmission in certain channel conditions. While this may improve the reliability of the system, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only reformats pointer variables in the `main.c` file of the `staging/speakup` directory, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that renames the driver from "ohci" to "ohci-da8xx" in the davinci ohci driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1) The patch fixes two bugs in the __lpc_handle_xmit() function of the lpc_eth driver.

2) The first bug is that it can leak skbs (socket buffers) if TXSTATUS_ERROR is set. This bug can potentially lead to resource leaks and memory issues.

3) The second bug is that it can wake up the txqueue even when no slot was freed. This bug can cause incorrect behavior and potential race conditions.

4) The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and reported/tested by Roland Stigge.

5) It is also cc'd to Kevin Wells.

6) The patch is further signed-off by David S. Miller, who is a maintainer of the drivers/net/ethernet/nxp/lpc_eth.c file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes real and critical bugs that can cause incorrect behavior and resource leaks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue where the cmos interrupt handler is allowed to run before resuming, causing problems with the alarm timer not being removed. This can lead to other timers not being cleared, resulting in timeouts for utilities like hwclock.

2. Impact:
   The issue described in the patch does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that can potentially affect the functionality of utilities relying on the update interrupt.

3. Fix:
   The patch adds a check to enable hpet_rtc_timer_init only if the device may wake up. This ensures that the call to hpet_rtc_timer_init is not undone during resume.

4. Code Analysis:
   The code changes are minimal and focused on adding the conditional check before calling hpet_rtc_timer_init. There are no trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses an issue related to the functionality of utilities but does not seem to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two issues related to the update-qp command in the mlx4_core driver. The first issue is a wrong bit mask for the supported driver features, and the second issue is a wrongly voided return value of the mlx4_update_qp() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze each issue:

1. Wrong bit mask for supported driver features:
   This issue seems to be a bug that could potentially cause incorrect behavior or data corruption. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting the definition of the bit mask. Therefore, this issue meets the criteria for a critical bug fix.

2. Wrongly voided return value of mlx4_update_qp():
   This issue indicates a potential error in the code where the return value of mlx4_update_qp() is not properly handled. While the patch fixes this issue by assigning the return value to the 'err' variable and adding error handling, it is not clear from the provided context whether this issue could lead to any critical problems such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of this issue.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a critical bug related to the wrong bit mask for supported driver features. However, without more information about the impact of the second issue, it is not possible to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the decision for this patch would be (A) ACK for the first issue and (B) NAK for the second issue until further information is provided.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. The patch adds missing configuration for MBUS windows access protection in the mvneta_conf_mbus_windows function. This configuration was unused since the initial support in v3.8, causing the register contents to be inherited from the bootloader.

The patch includes the necessary changes to enable the access protection by writing to the MVNETA_ACCESS_PROTECT_ENABLE register. This fix addresses a potential security issue by ensuring that the register contents are properly configured.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to security, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the usage of prsctp policies in the sctp module. The patch changes the check for prsctp enablement from `asoc->prsctp_enable` to `asoc->peer.prsctp_capable`, ensuring that prsctp is enabled on both the local and peer hosts.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing break statement in the set control handler of the tvp5150 driver. It fixes a potential issue where the hue control could enable or disable the decode completely.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The Tilera boot infrastructure now provides the initramfs to Linux with a different name, "initramfs", instead of "initramfs.cpio.gz". This change allows for the use of other compression techniques without causing confusion.

2. The patch ensures compatibility with older kernels: By falling back to checking for the old name, the patch ensures that older kernels remain compatible with the newer Tilera boot infrastructure.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a significant change in the boot infrastructure and is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and includes appropriate Cc's to relevant parties.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the issue and maintain compatibility with the Tilera boot infrastructure.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the async_probe generic module parameter. The bug causes a crash whenever the async_probe parameter is used, due to a missing required argument in the parse_args() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause a crash. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference in the bcm2835_i2c_isr() function. This bug was introduced in the commit e2474541032d, which fixed a hang issue for writing messages larger than 16 bytes.

The patch adds a check for a NULL curr_msg pointer before accessing its flags. If the curr_msg pointer is NULL, it logs an error message indicating an unexpected interrupt. Otherwise, it proceeds with the existing logic.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential crash scenario and improves error handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the translation of source code lines for call chains of user space applications in the perf report tool. The patch changes the usage of the "ip" variable to the "addr" variable in the addr_location structure.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and improves the accuracy of the reported call chains, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses an issue where kprobes fail to find symbols even if they exist in the map (dso). The current implementation relies on `map__load()` to find symbols, which does not work for kprobes as it reuses an existing kernel map. To fix this, the patch suggests using `map__find_symbol_by_name()` instead, which loads a map with full symbols and sorts them by name.

The patch also introduces a new function `find_probe_functions()` that uses `map__find_symbol_by_name()` to search for symbols in the map. It iterates through the symbols and counts the number of matched functions.

In the `find_probe_trace_events_from_map()` function, the patch replaces the previous implementation with a call to `find_probe_functions()` to find the matched symbols. If no symbols are found, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code.

The patch then continues to iterate through the symbols using `symbol__next_by_name()` and performs the necessary operations for each symbol found.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to kprobes and improves the efficiency of symbol searching. It does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes or non-critical changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the code related to setting the 'action' to 'idle' in the md (multiple devices) subsystem. The issue arises when checking the sync_thread without holding the mddev_lock(), which can lead to unsafe behavior.

The patch proposes a solution by introducing a check for the MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING flag before proceeding with the synchronization process. If the flag is set, the patch ensures that the flush, test, and reap operations are performed under the mddev_lock to avoid any race conditions with md_check_recovery.

The patch also includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it resolves a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the fix and understanding its context.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to confusion and potential issues with thread synchronization, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not contain any trivial fixes, as it focuses on resolving a race condition.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the debugfs entry creation path in the f2fs filesystem. It moves the initialization of the "status" debugfs entry to the init part of f2fs and the destruction of the entry to the exit part. This change ensures that the "status" entry is maintained for the entire F2FS filesystem, regardless of the number of partitions.

The patch also introduces two new functions: f2fs_create_root_stats and f2fs_destroy_root_stats. The f2fs_create_root_stats function creates the debugfs directory "f2fs" and the "status" file within it, while the f2fs_destroy_root_stats function removes the debugfs directory.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code refactoring or optimization related to debugfs entry creation.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The call to topology_init is too late for the set_sched_topology call. This suggests that there is a bug causing a timing issue in the current implementation.

2. The patch proposes a solution: It suggests using the smp_cpus_done() call to register the s390 specific topology array early enough. This change ensures that the set_sched_topology call is made at the appropriate time.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-critical modifications. It focuses solely on fixing the timing issue.

4. The patch is targeted for stable releases: The Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org tag indicates that this patch is suitable for inclusion in stable releases, specifically for versions v3.16 and above.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the TX queue stop/wake flow in the mlx4_en driver. The issue is that the "blocked" flag is redundant and can lead to a race condition. The patch removes the "blocked" flag and replaces it with a check using the netif_tx_queue_stopped function to avoid the race condition.

The patch also includes some code cleanup by removing the unnecessary assignment of "blocked" flag and initializing it to 0 in mlx4_en_activate_tx_ring function.

The changes in mlx4_en_process_tx_cq function ensure that the TX queue is woken up only if it was previously stopped and at least one packet was completed. This improves the efficiency of the TX queue handling.

In mlx4_en_xmit function, the patch removes the assignment of "blocked" flag and the subsequent queue stop operation. This is because the queue is already stopped when it becomes full, and there is no need to explicitly set the "blocked" flag.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the TX queue stop/wake flow and improves the code by removing redundant and unnecessary operations. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a reported bug (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42578) where copying large amounts of data from NTFS caused an OOM kill on 32-bit X86 with 16G of memory. This bug can lead to system instability and data loss, making it a critical issue.

2. The patch modifies the vmscan.c file, specifically the functions move_active_pages_to_lru(), shrink_active_list(), and balance_pgdat(). These functions are responsible for memory management and reclaiming in the kernel.

3. The patch introduces a change to force kswapd and direct reclaim to scan the highmem zone regardless of the allocation request or watermarks. This change aims to address the issue of lowmem being fully consumed by buffer_heads with nothing trying to free them.

4. The patch includes signed-off-by statements from multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to memory management and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak in the error path of the function `rsi_send_auto_rate_request()` in the `rsi_91x_mgmt.c` file. The patch frees the previously allocated `skb` in case memory allocation for the `selected_rates` array fails.

Since this patch addresses a potential memory leak, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the HID i2c-hid driver and ACPI GPIO interrupts. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug: The commit a485923efbb8 did not handle the case when acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() returns -ENXIO when CONFIG_GPIOLIB is not enabled.

2. The bug can cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: This bug does not seem to fall into any of these categories. It is more of a functional issue related to the handling of ACPI GPIO interrupts.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of percpu_ref_tryget() and percpu_ref_tryget_live() can result in a reference leak, leading to hangs and potential data corruption during CPU hotplug.

2. The bug can cause hangs and data corruption: The provided stack trace indicates that the bug can lead to hangs in blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait, which can impact I/O operations. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed.

3. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem: The patch describes the issue and provides a sample stack trace to demonstrate the problem. This helps in understanding the impact and urgency of the bug.

4. The fix is well-explained and targeted: The patch proposes a fix by using an actual boolean internally instead of truncating the atomic long result to an int. This ensures that the tryget routines return the correct value, preventing reference leaks.

5. The patch has been reviewed and tested: The patch has been reviewed by Jens Axboe and signed-off by Douglas Miller and Tejun Heo. It also includes a link to the bug report and mentions that it fixes a previous commit.

Considering all these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug, provides a clear explanation, and has been reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function in `fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c`. This is done because `s_dirty` is reset under that mutex.

2. The previous condition was incorrect because it did not consider cases where a checkpoint was done followed by all the node pages being written back. The patch fixes this issue.

3. The patch introduces a new label `out` and a `goto` statement to skip the checkpoint if `s_dirty` is not set. This ensures that the checkpoint is only performed when necessary.

4. The `unblock_operations` function is called after the checkpoint is completed.

5. The `stat_inc_cp_count` function is called to increment the checkpoint count in the statistics.

6. The `mutex_unlock` function is called to release the `cp_mutex`.

7. The `write_checkpoint` function is called from `f2fs_sync_fs` in `fs/f2fs/super.c` when `sync` is true.

8. In `f2fs_sync_fs`, the patch removes the previous condition that checked if `s_dirty` is not set and if there are no dirty nodes. This condition is no longer needed because the `write_checkpoint` function now handles the check for `s_dirty`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the checkpointing process in the F2FS filesystem. It ensures that the checkpoint is only performed when necessary and under the correct mutex. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to handle races with hardware (HW) when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The patch fixes a potential race condition where a short time to the next alarm could result in a delay of approximately 4 seconds until it triggers.

3. The patch introduces a check after updating the HW to ensure that the alarm timestamp is still in the future. If it is, the alarm is scheduled, and if not, it is moved to the completed list.

4. If there are no more pending alarms, the interrupt is shut down.

5. Finally, the completed callbacks are executed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential race condition and ensures that alarms are scheduled correctly. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could cause delays in alarm triggering.

true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch aims to fix an overflow condition in the `pool_find_page()` function of the `dmapool` module.
   - When a DMA pool is at the very top of the `dma_addr_t` range, the calculated end address of the pool wraps around to zero, causing page lookup failures.
   - The patch intends to make the relevant calculation overflow-proof.

2. Patch Changes:
   - In the `pool_find_page()` function, the following line is modified:
     - Before: `if (dma < (page->dma + pool->allocation))`
     - After: `if ((dma - page->dma) < pool->allocation)`

3. Analysis:
   - The original code compares the DMA address `dma` with the sum of `page->dma` and `pool->allocation`.
   - The modified code calculates the difference between `dma` and `page->dma` and compares it with `pool->allocation`.
   - This change ensures that the calculation does not overflow and correctly handles the wraparound case.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a critical bug that can cause page lookup failures when a DMA pool is at the top of the `dma_addr_t` range. The patch addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required for a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a problematic modification that was introduced accidentally. The patch aims to fix a regression where failed XS_TRANSACTION_START messages were leaving the transaction open, causing issues with suspend and migration.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can impact system stability and functionality, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving a specific issue related to transaction handling in xenbus_dev_request_and_reply().
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new software pte flag called L_PTE_NONE. This flag is set to identify faulting, present entries. The patch modifies various files in the ARM architecture to include this new flag in the page protection attributes.

From the patch description, it is not explicitly mentioned that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be addressing a potential security vulnerability where PROT_NONE pages can be read by tasks via syscalls such as read/write over a pipe.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. Instead, it addresses a potential security vulnerability.

Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt routing in the GEN9 hardware of the i915 driver. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `btrfs_init_test_fs()` function. The patch ensures that a negative error code is returned from the `kern_mount()` error handling case instead of 0, which is set by `register_filesystem`. This change is consistent with the error handling approach used elsewhere in the function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug by fixing an error return code, it can be considered for inclusion in a stable release. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the return value to correctly handle errors during the mount process.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the ratelimit code. Currently, when the ratelimit interval is passed (case #2), the `rs->begin` value is set to 0. This causes improper suppression because the time interval check will always be false, and `rs->printed` will not be initialized. As a result, even if enough time has passed, the ratelimit may return 0 if `rs->printed` is not less than `rs->burst`.

To fix this issue, the patch suggests setting `rs->begin` to `jiffies` instead of 0. This ensures that the interval is properly reset, allowing the ratelimit to function correctly.

The patch includes a test case that demonstrates the problem and shows the expected behavior after applying the fix.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that can lead to incorrect suppression in the ratelimit code. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the behavior of the UDP error handler in both IPv4 and IPv6 code paths.
2. In the IPv4 code path, the patch changes the handling of ICMP redirects. Instead of calling `ipv4_sk_redirect()`, it now jumps to the `out` label, effectively skipping the redirect handling.
3. In the IPv6 code path, the patch adds similar handling for NDISC redirects. It calls `ip6_sk_redirect()` and then jumps to the `out` label.
4. The `out` label is defined later in the code and is used to skip the rest of the error handling code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is modifying the behavior of the UDP error handler to not report ICMP redirects to user space. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or behavior change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a regression in HDMI audio functionality for the nv84 GPU. The patch adds missing code that was removed during a code refactoring commit, resulting in HDMI audio working again.

However, it is important to note that the patch author mentions that they were only able to test it on one HDMI head and it might be necessary to add similar code for nva3, which they couldn't test. This limitation should be taken into account during the evaluation process.

In summary, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the RGMII_MODE_EN bit in the bcmgenet driver. The patch correctly updates the value of RGMII_MODE_EN from 0 to 6, which is necessary for newer GENET controllers to enable their RGMII data-pad.

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the `md/raid5` module. The bug is described as `drop_one_stripe()` being called with `max_nr_stripes == 0`, which should not be allowed. The patch adds a test to ensure `max_nr_stripes` is kept above `min_nr_stripes` and uses a 'mask' instead of a 'mod' in `drop_one_stripe` to ensure the validity of 'hash' even if `max_nr_stripes` reaches zero.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a real issue where the ADS7846 regulator is disabled twice in a row in the ads7846_remove() function. The redundant regulator_disable() call causes a warning about unbalanced disables, which can lead to potential issues.

The patch removes the redundant regulator_disable() call and ensures that the valid call in ads7846_disable() is used instead. This fix resolves the warning and ensures proper handling of the regulator.

Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch disables register synchronization for low-frequency SYSCLK in the WM8996 codec. It mentions that with a low-frequency SYSCLK and a fast I2C clock, register synchronization may occasionally take too long to take effect, causing I/O issues. Disabling synchronization is proposed to avoid these issues.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function in `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.c` and adds a new variable `sync` initialized with the value of `WM8996_REG_SYNC`. It then updates the value of `sync` to 0 when the clock rate is 32000 or 32768. Finally, it updates the `WM8996_CONTROL_INTERFACE_1` register with the value of `sync` using `snd_soc_update_bits`.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch aims to address potential I/O issues caused by register synchronization delays when using a low-frequency SYSCLK with a fast I2C clock. By disabling synchronization in specific clock rate scenarios, it attempts to avoid these issues.

4. Criticality Assessment:

However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue related to I/O problems. The impact of the issue is not clearly defined, so it is difficult to assess its criticality accurately.

Considering the analysis above, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a (B) "should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK)" unless further information is provided to demonstrate the criticality of the I/O issues and their potential impact on system stability or security.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The code in the paging_init() function is ineffective in detecting unsupported highmem due to dcache aliasing, leading to potential coherency issues or triggering a BUG_ON in flush_kernel_dcache_page().

2. The patch fixes the issue by running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(), ensuring that the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro evaluates correctly and the unsupported highmem case is detected successfully.

3. The patch also resolves a hidden issue where mem_init_free_highmem() attempts to free all highmem pages, even though they are not used and lack valid page structs. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception. The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates true, avoiding the issue.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone peer review.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause an oops and log flooding. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a bug related to memory errors on hugepages and the incorrect handling of hugetlbfs swap entries. It explains that the bug occurs because the coredump-related code does not recognize the "hugepage hwpoison entry" and fails to retrieve the correct page from the given address.

The patch proposes a fix by modifying the follow_hugetlb_page() function to properly handle hugetlb_fault() for both hugepages under migration and hwpoisoned hugepages. This fix ensures that the affected processes can access the error hugepages correctly and allows for proper actions to be taken, such as waiting for migration entries or failing with VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE for hwpoisoned entries.

The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Naoya Horiguchi, Michal Hocko, KOSAKI Motohiro, and David Rientjes. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags.

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver.

2. Code changes: The code changes involve modifying the ath_tid_drain() function in the ath9k/xmit.c file.

3. Issue addressed: The patch addresses a situation where an A-MPDU subframe can still have fi->retries at 0 after a transmission attempt, which can occur if the retry count wasn't incremented due to powersave. In such cases, the subframe is still tracked as part of the block ack window. The patch ensures that when draining the tid queue, the sequence number of the subframe is cleared from the pending frame bitmap.

4. Impact: The issue being fixed does not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it can lead to incorrect tracking of subframes in the block ack window.

5. Code changes analysis: The code changes appear to be focused on addressing the specific issue described. There are no trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups included in the patch.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. While it does not directly fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it addresses an issue that can lead to incorrect behavior. However, the final decision ultimately rests with the maintainers and reviewers of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential buffer overflow issue in the HFS file system. The patch adds a sanity check for the file name length and limits it to HFS_NAMELEN if it exceeds that value.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential security issue (buffer overflow) and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: quirk asserts controllable backlight presence, overriding VBT". It suggests that the patch is related to the i915 driver for Intel graphics.

2. The commit message explains that the patch addresses a regression caused by a misconfigured VBT (Video BIOS Table) on certain machines. The patch adds a quirk to assert the presence of a controllable backlight and uses it to ignore the VBT backlight presence check during backlight setup.

3. The patch includes a Bugzilla reference (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79813) indicating that it addresses a specific bug.

4. The patch has been tested by James Duley and Michael Mullin, as mentioned in the "Tested-by" lines.

5. The patch has been reviewed by Jani Nikula, who is also one of the authors.

6. The patch includes the "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 3.15 only" line, indicating that it is intended for the stable branch of the Linux kernel.

7. The patch includes the "Signed-off-by" lines from Scot Doyle, Jani Nikula, and Daniel Vetter.

8. The patch adds a new quirk flag, QUIRK_BACKLIGHT_PRESENT, to the i915 driver.

9. The patch modifies the intel_panel.c file to handle the case where the VBT does not indicate the presence of a backlight.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a regression caused by a misconfigured VBT and adds a quirk to handle the presence of a controllable backlight. It has been tested and reviewed, and it includes the necessary metadata for inclusion in the stable branch.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to double accounting in the cpu-timer code. The issue is that the delta for the calling task is added twice, causing the sample to run ahead and making the sleep short. 

The patch modifies the `cpu_timer_sample_group()` function in `kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c` to remove the double accounting. It changes the line `*sample = cputime.sum_exec_runtime + task_delta_exec(p);` to `*sample = cputime.sum_exec_runtime;`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause incorrect behavior in the system. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to UVD suspend and resume for VI APU in the AMDGPU driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to skip the suspend and resume operations for APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) by checking the `AMD_IS_APU` flag in the `adev` structure. This indicates that the suspend and resume operations are not applicable or necessary for APUs.

2. The patch then proceeds to call `uvd_v6_0_hw_fini()` and `uvd_v6_0_hw_init()` functions for both APUs and non-APUs. These functions handle the hardware initialization and finalization for UVD (Unified Video Decoder) version 6.0.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a specific fix for UVD suspend and resume for non-APUs, while skipping these operations for APUs. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is reverting the default behavior of link protections in the VFS (Virtual File System) of the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that the new link protections introduced in a previous commit have caused issues with some applications and scripts, breaking existing systems.

The patch sets the sysctl variables `sysctl_protected_symlinks` and `sysctl_protected_hardlinks` to 0, effectively disabling the link protections by default.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it addresses a behavior change that has caused compatibility issues with certain applications and scripts.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: Yes, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking bug in the SELinux/NetLabel glue code. The bug causes a suspicious RCU usage error, which can lead to system instability. This bug can be considered a critical issue as it can potentially cause hangs or data corruption.

The patch itself converts the bottom half socket lock to a more conventional and correct lock_sock() call. This change should address the locking bug and prevent the error from occurring.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that the patch fixes it directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Mellanox and reviewed by Mark Bloch.
5. The patch modifies the mlx5_ib_add function in the main.c file of the mlx5 driver.
6. In the mlx5_ib_add function, if RoCE is not enabled or node data initialization fails, the code jumps to the "err_free_port" label instead of "err_dealloc" as before.
7. The "err_free_port" label is responsible for freeing the dev->port.
8. The patch also initializes mutexes and creates device resources.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to memory leak and ensures proper cleanup when RoCE cannot be enabled or node data initialization fails. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a build error, as indicated by the reported BUG and slab-out-of-bounds error.

2. The bug is reproducible on the Rockchip platform rk3368 SoC, which supports USB 2.0 and uses functionfs for ADB.

3. The bug is triggered when the kernel is built with CONFIG_KASAN=y and CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y, indicating that it is not a trivial issue.

4. The patch fixes the out-of-bounds access issue by checking if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor.

5. The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and another developer, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Considering these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a typo in the get_fmt callback function of the m5mols driver. The patch corrects an inverted check of the return value from __find_format().

Since this patch addresses a regression introduced in a previous commit and fixes a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. This BUG_ON statement was causing a regression in the Linux kernel version 3.5, resulting in a kernel crash.

The patch is removing the BUG_ON statement, which was intended to verify that no batches were submitted to the kernel while the UMS/GEM client was suspended. However, the checks performed by the BUG_ON statements are considered a crude approximation and are too late in the code execution to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state.

Considering that the BUG_ON statement is unnecessary and removing it does not introduce any new issues, it can be concluded that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). This is because it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a kernel crash, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the Xen pciback driver and the resetting of pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called. The patch aims to avoid resetting pci_dev->irq and mentions that a proper fix will be prepared for the next merging window.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially cause issues with the Xen pciback driver, it can be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. However, further analysis is required to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.) and that it meets the necessary quality standards.

Therefore, I would recommend further review and testing of the patch before making a final decision on whether to accept it in the Linux -stable releases.

Considering these factors, it appears that this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a resource management issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver. The patch reinitializes descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume, instead of freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues during suspend/resume, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and provides a more efficient solution by preserving memory data.

However, it is important to note that the patch should undergo thorough testing to ensure it does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues on different platforms.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds support for passing probe requests and beacons from other access points (APs) in AP mode and Group Owner (GO) mode. This change is necessary for proper handling of the ht protection IE.

Since the patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm in the TCP implementation. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause performance issues and longer HoL blocking. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged.
2. The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require calling prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical.
3. The patch suggests letting the driver decide when prepare_fb and cleanup_fb are noops, instead of handling all the special cases in the core.
4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to atomic drivers and allows the driver to handle prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions appropriately. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix a real and critical bug or issue.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Given that the patch is reverting a previous implementation and the reason provided for the revert is a race condition, it suggests that the previous implementation was causing issues. Additionally, the patch mentions the need to revisit how to properly support kexec within the DRM.

Based on this information, it appears that the patch is addressing a real and critical issue related to shutdown or driver unload time, which can potentially lead to hangs or other problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open.
2. It addresses a specific scenario where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.
3. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.
4. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to use the synack_stamp instead of tp->lsndtime to compute the SYNACK RTT.
5. It also adds a check to only update the RTT if synack_stamp is available and there are no total retransmissions.
6. Additionally, the patch introduces a new condition to check if tp->srtt is zero before updating the RTT in tcp_ack_update_rtt(). This condition ensures that the SYNACK RTT is only updated if it hasn't been already updated in tcp_ack().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific scenario related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and improves the accuracy of the RTT measurement. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch changes the way signaling is done based on the queue depth, removing a magic define.
3. It introduces a new function `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit` to calculate the signaling limit based on the queue depth.
4. The patch modifies the condition for signaling completion to use the new function `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit`.
5. The patch also mentions that the existing code snippet is copied from the iSER initiator and the magic number '32' is derived from there.
6. The patch ensures that flushes are always signaled and explains the reason behind it.
7. The patch includes appropriate Cc, Signed-off-by, and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to NVMe-oF queue size and improves the signaling mechanism. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the intended behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It modifies the scheduling behavior of the task, which could potentially address a real and critical bug or issue.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

4. The change is specific to the stmpe-ts.c file in the drivers/input/touchscreen directory, suggesting that it targets a specific functionality or driver.

Based on these observations, the patch seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It fixes a potential issue related to task scheduling and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug related to a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver. This bug was introduced by the commit 7d32cdef5356, which caused the core platform driver to correctly return an error code when failing to probe.

The patch adds a validation check for the musb pointer before calling the usb_phy_set_suspend function, preventing the NULL pointer dereference. This fix addresses a potential hang or system instability issue during system suspend.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause a hang or system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not getting out of idle when HDMI is enabled. The patch adds a temporary hack by calling `dss_runtime_get()` before `pm_runtime_get_sync()` to ensure the DSS clock domain is enabled.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause HDMI not to work when it's the default display. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the patch author suggests that a correct fix should be implemented later by modifying the DSS related hwmod's mainclks and making changes in how optional clocks are handled in the DSS driver.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error in the s3c2410_udc driver. The error is caused by passing the address of a bit-field 'maxpacket' instead of its value to the 'usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit' function.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. However, it is important to note that this fix is not considered trivial, as it involves correcting a fundamental error in the code.

Therefore, the correct decision is (A) to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and the information given, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the memory allocated for struct request_queue needs to stay around until all blk_exit_rl() calls have finished. This suggests that there is a use-after-free bug related to struct request_queue.

2. The patch fixes a specific crash that is caused by a general protection fault. The crash is described in detail, including the stack trace and the affected task.

3. The Fixes tag references a specific commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear indication of the bug being addressed.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been acknowledged by Tejun Heo. It has also been reviewed by Hannes Reinecke and Christoph Hellwig.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to a use-after-free issue in struct request_queue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt enable code in the cavium-octeon MMC driver. The patch description explains that on certain OCTEON SoCs with CIU3, there is no interrupt masking local to the MMC bus interface, and attempting to write to the enable register can cause interrupts to fire immediately, breaking the driver.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `octeon_mmc_int_enable` function to only write to the enable register if the `has_ciu3` flag is not set. This ensures that the register is not touched on SoCs where it can cause problems.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause issues with the driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a hang issue related to direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN. The patch ensures that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag is set and the i_aiodio_unwritten counter is increased simultaneously. This prevents the counter from going negative and causing processes to wait indefinitely.

The patch also includes additional defensive checks to ensure the flag is not already set before incrementing the counter. This is done in both the ext4_end_io_buffer_write() function in fs/ext4/inode.c and the io_submit_add_bh() function in fs/ext4/page-io.c.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to a lockdep warning in the IB/ipoib driver. The lockdep warning indicates a possible recursive locking scenario, which can lead to a deadlock. The patch proposes using `down_read_nested` instead of `down_read` to prevent the warning.

Considering that the lockdep warning indicates a potential issue that can cause a hang or deadlock, and the patch addresses this issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug that can cause a hang and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a NULL pointer dereference when read_tree_block() fails, leading to an oops and potential system instability.

2. The bug is not a trivial issue: It results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference, which can cause system crashes or hangs.

3. The patch fixes the bug by setting the tree_root->node to NULL when read_tree_block() fails. This prevents the subsequent code from triggering the error and resolves the NULL pointer dereference issue.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It focuses on fixing the critical bug and does not include spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-essential modifications.

Based on these points, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI-E transport "inta" race in the iwlwifi driver. The bug causes interrupts to be missed if the reset happens after some other interrupt reasons were already added to the variable. This bug could potentially lead to random command timeouts.

The patch itself addresses the issue by resetting the "trans_pcie->inta" variable after releasing the spinlock, ensuring that interrupts are not missed. The patch also includes a comment explaining the bug and how it was discovered.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to command timeouts and has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized memory access issue when writing to oprofilefs on the s390 architecture. The patch checks the return value of the oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() function and returns an error if it is less than or equal to zero.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sctp_diag module in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the condition for skipping certain endpoints during dumping, specifically when the idiag_states flag does not have the TCPF_LISTEN flag set and the endpoint's asocs list is not empty.

The patch introduces a change to the condition by adding the TCPF_CLOSE flag to the check. This change ensures that the sctp_diag module correctly handles endpoints that have the TCPF_CLOSE flag set, in addition to the TCPF_LISTEN flag.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a relatively minor fix that improves the behavior of the sctp_diag module.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the values of LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 in the poison.h header file. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is simply adjusting the values of poison pointers to be smaller for systems with small mmap_min_addr setups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that the previous fix accidentally changed the loop condition in too many places while fixing a real bug. This indicates that there was a genuine issue that needed to be addressed.

2. The patch correctly fixes the loop condition in the dual_emac mode section, where 'i' is used as an index into priv->slaves, which is a 0-based array. This fix is necessary to ensure correct behavior.

3. The other two changes, which are only used in switch mode, were incorrect in the previous fix. In switch mode, 'i' represents the ALE port number, where port 0 is the host port and ports 1 and up are the slave ports. The patch restores the correct loop condition for switch mode.

4. The addition of comments clarifies the intent of the code and helps avoid future confusion. Additionally, a comment that previously stated the opposite of what was happening has been fixed.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone review and approval.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug and improves the correctness of the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning generated by newer versions of GCC. The warning is related to a potential implicit fall-through in a switch statement. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an issue where the `sock_tx_timestamp()` function in `packet_snd()` does not work correctly when the `sendto` syscall is used without a `msg_control` buffer. This issue can cause the syscall to not function properly.

The patch sets `socks.tsflags` to `sk->sk_tsflags` as the default value, which should resolve the problem.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the `sendto` syscall. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lockdep splat issue in the l2tp module. The lockdep splat is a possible recursive locking scenario that can lead to a deadlock. This issue can cause hangs and impact system stability.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving the lockdep splat issue, which is a significant problem.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PFMF instruction handler in the s390 architecture. The patch attempts a copy-on-write (COW) operation on read-only pages before continuing and bails out in case of errors. This addresses a potential issue where the storage key is blindly written even if the page is mapped as read-only in the host.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems like a valid patch that addresses a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change in question is a negation of the return value of `ti->type->iterate_devices()` function call. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` to clear the RWC (Read/Write Clear) bit in the PORTSC (Port Status and Control) register.

2. The function `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` checks if the RWC bit is set in the PORTSC register. If it is set, the function clears the RWC bit and updates the register.

3. The patch modifies the `xhci_bus_resume()` function in `xhci-hub.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC (Port Link Control) bit in the PORTSC register.

4. The patch also modifies the `handle_port_status()` function in `xhci-ring.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC bit in the PORTSC register.

5. The patch adds the declaration of the `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function in `xhci.h`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to use it. The purpose of the patch is to clear the RWC and PLC bits in the PORTSC register when necessary.

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than fixing a critical issue.

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem: The kernel hangs during bootup on Little Endian (LE) operating systems when both IMA and VTPM are enabled.

2. Cause: The hang occurs because IMA calls `tpm_pcr_read()`, which triggers the execution of `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` and `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()`. It was observed that `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()` was hanging.

3. Resolution: The patch fixes the hang by addressing the issue in `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()`. The problem was caused by `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` sending a CRQ message that didn't make sense to phype (Power Hypervisor) due to Endianness. The patch ensures that the CRQ is correctly converted for Little Endian systems.

4. Testing: The patch has been tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in the kernel configuration on both Big Endian (BE) and Little Endian (LE) PowerPC64 LPARs. The testing covers the CRQ and TPM command code paths in the VTPM module.

5. Patch Details: The patch modifies the `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` function in `tpm_ibmvtpm.c` and the `struct ibmvtpm_crq` in `tpm_ibmvtpm.h`. It replaces the usage of `u64` with `__be64` for the `word` variable and uses appropriate conversion functions (`cpu_to_be16()`, `cpu_to_be32()`, `be64_to_cpu()`) for the `crq.len` and `crq.data` fields.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the function `send_leave` sets the `group->query_id` member after calling `sa_query`, but `leave_handler` can be executed before the setting, potentially deleting the `group` object and causing memory corruption. This indicates a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption.

2. The patch also mentions that the `group->query_id` variable is not used, so removing it does not affect the functionality of the code.

3. The patch includes the `Fixes` tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug, which adds credibility to the fix.

4. The code changes in the patch remove the assignment of `ret` to `group->query_id` in both `send_join` and `send_leave` functions. Instead, it returns 0 if `ret` is greater than 0, indicating a successful query, and returns `ret` otherwise. This change ensures that the `group->query_id` is not accessed after potential memory corruption.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the virtio console driver. It ensures that when a port is unplugged, all subsequent read operations return -ENODEV, indicating that the device is no longer available. This is important for proper error handling and preventing potential issues caused by reading from a disconnected device.

The patch also mentions that previously, even if a port was unplugged, subsequent read operations would return 0, which did not indicate that the device had gone away. This could lead to confusion for users who were not monitoring the SIGIO signal, as they would not have a chance to find out if the port went away.

The fix is straightforward and does not contain any trivial changes. It adds a check to return -ENODEV on all read operations if the port is unplugged. The existing behavior for write operations already handles this correctly.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the non-trivial fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to GPU reset in the Intel i915 driver.

Since this patch addresses a real bug and improves error handling, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "Avoid OOM when requesting highmem"
   - This indicates that the patch aims to prevent an out-of-memory (OOM) situation when requesting highmem pages from the balloon.

2. Code changes:
   - The patch modifies the `alloc_xenballooned_pages` function in the `drivers/xen/balloon.c` file.
   - Specifically, it changes the behavior of the function when `highmem` pages are requested.

3. Code analysis:
   - The original code allocates all available memory when trying to find highmem pages to return, which can lead to an OOM situation on systems without highmem.
   - The patch modifies the code to allow low memory to be returned when highmem pages are requested, thus avoiding the loop that could cause an OOM.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue (OOM when requesting highmem) and provides a fix that avoids the problematic loop.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to preventing inner-reload while virtual functions (VFs) exist in the bnx2x driver. The bug caused the prevention of bnx2x_resume() from running, which was harmless but incorrect. The patch moves the check to the correct spot.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a non-critical issue related to MTU change prevention when VFs are enabled.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "PCI: imx6: Fix config read timeout handling" and it references a specific commit that made PCI configuration requests non-posted.

2. The patch explains that synchronous aborts need to be handled differently from the asynchronous aborts that were previously encountered. It mentions that the PC (program counter) needs to be advanced when resolving the abort.

3. The patch includes a function called "imx6q_pcie_abort_handler" that handles the aborts. It checks the instruction being executed and modifies the registers accordingly.

4. The patch also includes a call to "hook_fault_code" to install the abort handler.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to PCI configuration requests timing out and introduces a fix to handle synchronous aborts correctly. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to PCI configuration and does not include any trivial changes.

7. In the modified code, the patch removes the "SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VPID" flag from the "nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs" function.
8. Instead of unconditionally setting the "SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VPID" flag, the patch conditionally sets it based on the value of the "enable_vpid" variable.
9. If "enable_vpid" is true, the "SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VPID" flag is set, and the "nested_vmx_vpid_caps" variable is updated accordingly.
10. If "enable_vpid" is false, the "nested_vmx_vpid_caps" variable is set to 0.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to nested VPID vmx exec control in the KVM subsystem and provides a clear and well-documented solution. The patch also follows the necessary conventions, such as being signed-off and referencing the commit it fixes.

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current reservation of the full SZ_16M range in the thunder_pem_legacy_fw() function causes a failure in child device driver initialization when the pcieport driver requests resources. This bug can lead to the inability to enable the device, resulting in a functional issue.

2. The patch fixes the bug by modifying the reservation of resources. Instead of reserving the full SZ_16M range, only the PEM-specific register (SZ_64K) is reserved. This change ensures that the child device driver initialization does not fail.

3. The patch also increases the PEM resource size back to SZ_16M at the end. This is necessary for proper initialization in the thunder_pem_init() call.

4. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag, providing a reference to the commit that introduced the bug.

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and a maintainer, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.

6. The patch includes the appropriate CC to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it should be considered for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these points, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch title: "ksm: fix m68k build: only NUMA needs pfn_to_nid"
   - The patch aims to fix a build error specific to the m68k architecture when the CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM configuration is enabled.

2. Description:
   - The error occurs in the mm/ksm.c file at line 492, where the function `pfn_to_nid` is implicitly declared.
   - The error is due to the expectation that the arch's asm/mmzone.h file should declare `pfn_to_nid` for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM, similar to how it is declared for CONFIG_SPARSEMEM and CONFIG_FLATMEM.
   - The patch suggests that the declaration of `pfn_to_nid` is only expected when CONFIG_NUMA is enabled.
   - The patch fixes the build error by modifying the `get_kpfn_nid` function to use `NUMA(pfn_to_nid(kpfn))` instead of `pfn_to_nid(kpfn)` when `ksm_merge_across_nodes` is false.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific build error on the m68k architecture caused by the missing declaration of `pfn_to_nid` for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.
   - It does not fix any critical bug, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical issue related to the GIC/GICv3 interrupt controller on ARM-based systems. The patch ensures that all interrupts are deactivated and disabled at boot time to guarantee a clean state.

This patch addresses a potential problem where the firmware or a previous kernel may have left some interrupts active, leading to unpredictable behavior. By clearing the active bits and disabling all SPIs (Shared Peripheral Interrupts), the patch ensures a clean and reliable initialization of the interrupt controller.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause unexpected behavior or system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to overwriting PHY interrupts with a value of 0. This bug can lead to unpredictable behavior depending on the PHY's location on the MDIO bus. The patch removes the memcpy operation and the now unused phy_irq member to ensure that the SMSC911x PHYs are always in polling mode.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause unpredictable behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to lockups caused by iput() calls in the Btrfs file system. The patch replaces the iput() calls with btrfs_add_delayed_iput() to delay the iputs and prevent potential lockups.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a real security issue.

4. The patch is well-documented: The patch includes a clear description of the bug it fixes and references the commit that introduced the issue.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch simplifies the netlink message length assignment by using the precalculated size instead of subtracting and adding the netlink header length.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (simplifying code without addressing any real issue), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "iio: adc: at91: don't use the last converted data register." It addresses an issue where the last converted data register can contain touchscreen relative values if a conversion is requested on another channel while the touchscreen mode is enabled. This can lead to incorrect data being read from the register.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the at91_adc_read_raw() function in the at91_adc.c file. It introduces a new variable "chnb" to store the channel number and uses it to read the channel data register instead of the last converted data register.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch aims to prevent incorrect data from being read from the last converted data register when touchscreen mode is enabled. It ensures that the conversion value is taken from the channel data register instead. This fix addresses a potential data corruption issue.

4. Patch Size and Complexity:
   The patch is relatively small and focused. It introduces a new variable and modifies a few lines of code within the at91_adc_read_raw() function.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to data corruption and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the backref code in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch addresses a problem where nodes were being checked along with leaves when populating extent item entries, which could lead to unexpected issues. 

The patch modifies the code to only perform the check on extent item positions when certain conditions are met, specifically when `ref->inode_list` is not present and `ref->level` is 0. This change ensures that the check is only performed when necessary and avoids potential problems.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a specific issue and the fact that it does not contain any trivial changes, such as spelling or whitespace fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` is being removed from the code. The patch states that there is nothing to prevent another thread from dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call to `nfs4_ds_disconnect()`, which could result in a NULL pointer dereference and potentially cause an Oops.

The patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid the issue with the device ID instead. It seems that the intention is to prevent the potential NULL pointer dereference by removing the `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` function.

Given this information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a potential issue that could lead to an Oops.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to running the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver.

2. The current behavior of calling dev_close() in the offline self-test causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes interface routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent with bringing down the interface before the test.

3. The proposed solution is to call the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(), avoiding the clearing of IFF_UP.

4. The patch includes changes in the ixgbe.h, ixgbe_ethtool.c, and ixgbe_main.c files.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to the offline self-test behavior in the ixgbe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a real and critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops. This qualifies as a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The bug is caused by an incorrect implementation in the workingset shadow nodes shrinker, which becomes memcg aware. The patch addresses this issue by checking the sc->memcg variable instead of using memcg_kmem_enabled().

3. The fix has been tested and reported by Marek Marczykowski-Grecki, and it has been acknowledged by Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh.

4. The patch is also marked as a stable fix, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems appropriate to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch increases the maximum number of properties in the DRM subsystem from 16 to 24. The reason for this change is to address a situation where on i915 machines with many TV connectors, the maximum number of properties is reached, resulting in backtraces in the logs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a limitation in the number of properties for a specific use case.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the criteria, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to revert a deprecation warning message related to SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. The reasons for reverting the message are outlined in the patch description:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and cannot be changed, making the deprecation warning unnecessary.
2) Applications using SCTP need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support to ensure compatibility with older and newer kernels.
3) Some applications, especially those with proprietary legacy components, may not have the ability to change and will be affected by the warning.

The patch author argues that the warning provides little benefit, especially considering point 1. The issue was reported by Jamal Hadi Salim, and the patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by him.

Upon reviewing the code changes, the patch removes the warning message from the sctp_setsockopt_events function in the net/sctp/socket.c file.

Given the reasoning provided and the removal of the warning message, which does not fix a critical bug or introduce any potential issues, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the release of the mcc/mbox lock in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function in the be_cmds.c file of the be2net driver. The patch ensures that the lock is released in case be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier.

   Yes, the bug can potentially cause hangs or data corruption, making it a critical issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on addressing the bug.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an off-by-two bug in the "perf hists browser" tool. The bug causes misalignment in the normal output. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the pinctrl driver for the Baytrail platform. The patch clears the BYT_DIRECT_IRQ_EN bit for pads using IO mode, which can prevent the IO-based IRQ from being detected. The patch also includes a WARN message to indicate a bad pad configuration for IO mode.

Considering that this patch addresses a real issue that can cause functionality problems, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential hang or data corruption issue that could occur due to misconfiguration of the BYT_DIRECT_IRQ_EN bit.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing may be necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to the use of variable-length arrays in the kernel/sys.c file. The patch replaces the variable-length array with a fixed-size array of 65 characters.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be addressing a potential code generation problem on the POWER architecture and avoiding the use of variable-length arrays for better code generation.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in this case.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling the use of shadow registers in the iwlwifi driver by default due to reliability issues causing host command timeouts. The patch sets the `shadow_reg_enable` parameter to `false` for various iwlwifi devices.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause communication issues and host command timeouts. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a regression where kswapd could previously compact, but kcompactd could not. It addresses an issue where kcompactd never wakes up due to a mistake in the zoneindex calculation. The patch modifies the code to use the correct comparison operator (<=) instead of (<) in two places.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a functional issue rather than a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a build error caused by commit 03fbf488cece, which removed the type LPSS_SSP without realizing it was used in this code.
2. The build error is a real and critical bug that prevents successful compilation of the code.
3. The patch removes the incorrect DT binding that caused the build error, effectively resolving the issue.
4. The patch is reported by Axel Lin and signed-off by Jarkko Nikula and Robert Jarzmik, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.
5. The patch is also marked for stable release (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), suggesting that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by commit 05cc5a39ddb7 in the bnx2x driver. The regression causes a null pointer dereference when loading the 8021q module on machines with 57710 or 57711 adapters. The patch adds a check for the specific chip type and sets the accept_any_vlan flag accordingly.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can lead to a null pointer dereference, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that can potentially cause system instability or crashes, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch modifies the dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() function in the dwc3/gadget.c file. It aims to improve the algorithm used to resize transmit (TX) FIFOs in the DWC3 USB gadget driver.

The patch changes the loop that iterates over the endpoints. Previously, it iterated over all DWC3_ENDPOINTS_NUM endpoints, but now it iterates only over the number of IN endpoints specified by the dwc->num_in_eps parameter. This change prevents dereferencing a potential NULL dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

The patch also updates the FIFO size calculation and the write to the FIFO size register based on the new loop index 'num' instead of 'fifo_number'.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a potential issue related to NULL dereference and improves the algorithm for resizing TX FIFOs. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch seems to be a "trivial" fix that falls under the category of whitespace cleanup and code refactoring. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the SCTP module. This bug can lead to a kernel panic and is triggered by a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet. The patch addresses the issue by checking for a NULL return value from the sctp_get_af_specific() function, which could occur in certain scenarios.

Considering that the bug can lead to a kernel panic and the patch fixes a real and critical issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to accessing ctl_table in the proc_sys_poll() function. The bug can cause issues when poll() is called in entries created by modules, such as hostname and domainname. If an entry goes away while polling, ctl_table may not exist anymore, leading to potential issues.

The patch adds protection by grabbing the header with grab_header() before accessing ctl_table and releasing it with sysctl_head_finish() afterward. This ensures that the code accessing ctl_table is protected and prevents potential issues.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to potential issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to enable CPUID for Intel SHA extensions, which provides new instructions for accelerated computation of SHA-1 and SHA-256. It adds the X86_FEATURE_SHA_NI definition to the cpufeature.h file.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for a new CPU feature.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the error message in the l2c310_of_parse() function in the ARM architecture. The patch changes the error message from "PL310 OF: cache setting yield illegal associativity" to "L2C-310 OF cache associativity %d invalid, only 8 or 16 permitted". 

Since this patch only modifies the error message and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to setting the IRQ thread policy without checking CAP_SYS_NICE. The patch uses sched_setscheduler_nocheck() to omit the CAP_SYS_NICE check, which is required for the SCHED_OTHER policy.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria for acceptance. The patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an issue related to thread priority and the SCHED_OTHER policy.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug or a "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a significant problem.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the dma_mmap() function in the ARM IOMMU-based dma-mapping implementation. The patch adds a missing range check for mmap parameters, specifically the offset and buffer size, to prevent access beyond the allocated buffer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or access beyond allocated memory. Therefore, it qualifies as a fix for a real and critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to size updates for asynchronous I/O (AIO) writes in the NFS (Network File System) module.

2. The patch addresses a bug where the inode size is not updated correctly when AIO writes are performed.

3. The current implementation of nfs_file_direct_write only updates the inode size if the write operation succeeds and returns the number of bytes written. However, in the AIO case, the return value is converted to -EIOCBQUEUED, causing the size update to be skipped.

4. The patch modifies the nfs_direct_complete function to update the inode size correctly in the AIO completion path.

5. The implementation includes a hacky workaround because there is no straightforward way to determine if nfs_direct_complete is called for a write operation in nfs_direct_complete.

6. The patch also modifies the nfs_direct_read_completion, nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec, and nfs_direct_write_schedule_work functions to call nfs_direct_complete with the appropriate write flag.

7. Overall, the patch addresses a specific bug related to size updates for AIO writes in the NFS module and provides a fix for it.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption or incorrect file sizes in NFS AIO writes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The WRITE_SAME commands are not present in the blk_default_cmd_filter write_ok list, causing them to fail with -EPERM when the SG_IO ioctl() is executed without CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

2. The problem can be reproduced and observed with the sg_write_same command, which fails with "Operation not permitted" when executed by unprivileged users.

3. The patch adds the WRITE_SAME commands to the write_ok list, allowing the SG_IO ioctl to finish successfully.

4. The patch is reported to fix SCSI I/O errors observed in QEMU KVM guests with 'scsi-block' devices, which employ the SG_IO ioctl() and run as unprivileged users.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author, reviewers, and maintainers.

6. The patch includes relevant links to related commits and documentation for further reference.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can lead to a null-pointer dereference and a kernel panic. The patch cancels pending work for each unit in sbp2_remove(), ensuring that there are no extra references preventing the module from unloading.

Considering that the bug can cause a kernel panic, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can potentially lead to system instability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the incorrect re-injection of STP packets in the bridge module. This bug can potentially cause issues with the kernel's STP functionality. The patch addresses this by learning the packet's source MAC address and injecting it back into the Rx path for further processing.

Additionally, the patch ensures consistent behavior with regards to packets destined to the Bridge Group Address, regardless of whether STP is enabled or not.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493) that caused problems on GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link.

2. The patch is signed-off by Giuseppe Cavallaro <peppe.cavallaro@st.com> and has several Cc's.

3. In the stmmac_mdio_register() function, the patch modifies the code to check for a compatible child node ("snps,dwmac-mdio") under the device's of_node. If found, it sets the mdio_node variable accordingly.

4. In the stmmac_probe_config_dt() function, the patch removes the code that searches for a child node with the compatible string "snps,dwmac-mdio" and assigns it to the plat->mdio_node variable.

5. In the plat_stmmacenet_data structure definition in include/linux/stmmac.h, the patch removes the mdio_node variable.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch reverts a commit that caused issues with specific boards when connected to a real transceiver. The changes made in the patch seem to address the issue by modifying the code related to mdio_node handling.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause connectivity issues on specific hardware configurations, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) cipher handle in the drbg_healthcheck_sanity() function. The patch also removes a call to drbg_generate() with an uninitialized DRBG, which was previously causing a build error.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG handle, which is an inappropriate use of the kernel crypto API. While it may not directly cause a build error or a security issue, it is considered a bug as it violates the proper usage of the API.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug that violates the proper usage of the kernel crypto API.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the PCI config address for DDW (Dynamic DMA Window) in the powerpc/pseries architecture. The patch modifies the calculation of the cfg_addr variable to match the expected format specified by the PAPR (Power Architecture Platform Reference) specification.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug related to PCI config address handling and follows the PAPR specification, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error on sparc64 caused by missing exported symbols in the mc13xxx-regulator-core.c file. The patch exports the symbols "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" to resolve the build failure.

Since the patch addresses a real bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the patch.

6. The patch modifies the vudc_transfer.c file, which is part of the USBIP subsystem, suggesting that it is relevant to the USBIP functionality.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair.
2. Previously, MTU probing initialization only occurred at connect() and SYN or SYN-ACK reception, but these scenarios did not cover repaired sockets.
3. As a result, if MTU probing was enabled and TCP_MAXSEG sockopt was not used before connect(), probing would be stuck at the tcp_base_mss value until tcp_probe_interval seconds have passed.
4. The patch adds the necessary MTU probing initialization when setting the MSS in a TCP repair.
5. It also includes the necessary function call tcp_mtup_init(sk) to reinitialize MTU probing.
6. The patch modifies the tcp_repair_options_est() function to use the correct TCP socket structure (struct sock *sk) instead of the TCP socket structure (struct tcp_sock *tp).
7. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair. It ensures that MTU probing is correctly initialized when setting the MSS in a TCP repair, preventing the probing from being stuck at the wrong value. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes some variables from unsigned int to size_t. This change is aimed at enabling 64-bit arithmetic for very large files. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The udf_next_aext() function can potentially loop forever for a corrupted filesystem. This can lead to system hangs or data corruption, which qualifies as a critical bug.

2. The patch introduces a limit on the number of indirect extents that can be followed in a row. This prevents the potential infinite loop and provides a safeguard against corrupted filesystems.

3. The patch includes a clear and concise changelog, which improves the documentation and readability of the code.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Vegard Nossum, Jan Kara, Quentin Casasnovas, and Andrew Morton. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch updates the set_discard_limits() function to properly align discards sent to the DM thin device on a full block boundary, ensuring that each discard covers an entire DM thin-pool block and the block is reclaimed.

Since this patch addresses a real issue that can potentially lead to data corruption or loss, it can be considered critical. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The mvsas driver is causing a General Protection Fault when encountering an expander attached ATA device. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The analysis explains the root cause of the bug: The driver assumes all ATA devices are locally attached and obtains the phy mask by indexing the local phy table. However, expanders have more phys than the HBA, causing an index overflow and returning incorrect data.

3. The patch proposes a fix: It suggests mirroring the approach used in mvs_task_prep_ssp() for obtaining the phy mask using the port properties in mvs_task_prep_ata(). This fix should prevent the panic caused by the index overflow.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: It includes the reported-by and tested-by tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by Adam Talbot. It also includes the signed-off-by tag from James Bottomley, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the author.

5. The patch is submitted to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list: This indicates that the patch is intended for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases, which are focused on bug fixes and stability improvements.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be ACKed.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit and fixes shortcomings in the pci_restore_state() function. It ensures that the restoration of Base Address Registers (BARs) is retried only for Type 0 configuration headers, as opposed to treating all PCI devices as Type 0.

The patch modifies the pci_restore_config_space() function to include a new function, pci_restore_config_space_range(), which handles the restoration of BARs within a specified range. The pci_restore_config_space() function is then updated to call pci_restore_config_space_range() based on the header type of the PCI device.

The patch also includes a Tested-by tag, indicating that it has been tested by Mikko Vinni, and is signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki and Linus Torvalds.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of the pci_restore_state() function. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the restoration of BARs. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the programming of the CSMSADRCFG register in the ARM PXA3xx platform. It states that the register must be programmed to 0x2 for correct behavior of the Static Memory Controller.

2. The patch explains that without this fix, devices wired to DFI and accessed through SMC cannot be accessed after resuming from S2.

3. The patch explicitly mentions not relying on the bootloader to program the CSMSADRCFG register, indicating that the fix should be implemented in the kernel smemc module.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the smemc.c file to set the CSMSADRCFG register to 0x2 during resume.

5. The patch also includes a comment explaining the purpose of the CSMSADRCFG register and its bit definitions.

6. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Igor Grinberg and Eric Miao, and is also CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list.

Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the ARM PXA3xx platform, fixes a critical bug that can cause devices to be inaccessible after resume, and provides the necessary changes to set the CSMSADRCFG register to the correct value. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the restoration of UCB1x00 gpio output data on resume. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect GPIO output data after a resume. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior in the system. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, which is considered invalid according to the Software Developer's Manual (SDM). However, the code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).

2. The patch aims to get back to real mode to prepare a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER. This process is more complicated if the vCPU supports long mode.

3. The patch checks if the vCPU supports long mode. If it does, it clears CR4.PCIDE before CR0.PG and sets up a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA.

4. For the 64-bit case, the patch clears EFER.LMA by clearing CR0.PG and CR0.PE.

5. The patch also clears CR4.PAE (before clearing EFER.LME) and finally goes back to 32-bit mode.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode. It introduces necessary checks and modifications to ensure a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER. Since it fixes a real and critical bug related to system management mode, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the madvise_free_huge_pmd function in the mm/huge_memory.c file. The patch ensures that the fallback PTE operations are correctly executed after splitting a transparent huge page (THP) if necessary.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific behavior in the code that could be improved but does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI versatile host bridge driver. The bug causes the PCI IO resource to be considered valid even if the kernel fails to map the PCI host bridge memory address driving IO cycles to the CPU virtual address space.

The patch addresses this issue by destroying the PCI host bridge PCI IO resources retrieved through firmware when the pci_remap_iospace() function call fails. This prevents the kernel from adding the respective PCI IO resource to the list of valid resources, thereby fixing the problem.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to incorrect resource assignment and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the handling of the last register block in the specified range. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of registers that should be synced, resulting in either syncing too few or too many registers.

The patch correctly adjusts the calculation formula to ensure the correct number of registers are synced. It updates the code by subtracting the number of the first register in the block from the max register number and adding one.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that can potentially lead to incorrect synchronization of registers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the powerpc specific nx-842 compression driver. The patch addresses the problem of not properly handling vmalloc addresses, which causes a failure due to the lack of passing a proper physical address to the hypervisor.

The patch introduces a new routine, `nx842_get_pa()`, which checks if the address is a vmalloc address and handles it appropriately. It replaces the usage of `__pa()` with `nx842_get_pa()` in several places within the code.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it fixes a critical bug that could lead to failures, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces structure assignments with timer API functions. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or performance improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses two issues in the dummy-hcd driver. The first issue is a NULL pointer dereference and a WARN_ON that can occur when unloading a gadget driver. The patch fixes this by checking if the driver argument is NULL before printing its name. This is a real bug that can cause issues and should be fixed.

The second issue is related to the removal of a sysfs attribute file attached to the gadget. The patch moves the removal before the UDC is deleted, which is the correct order of operations. This ensures that the attribute file is properly removed and avoids any potential issues.

Both of these issues are not trivial fixes and can potentially cause problems such as crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the data type of two variables from 'u32' to 'int'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any reported issues or provide any specific fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to transmission failure on a Sierra Wireless MC7710 device. The patch modifies the cdc_mbim_info structure by adding the FLAG_SEND_ZLP flag. 

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes transmission failure, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the change does not seem to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, my decision is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression: The patch fixes a regression where the driver fails when Device Tree (DT) is enabled because the Device Tree probing code is not executed.

2. Rejigging probe() semantics: The patch modifies the probe() function to attempt to extract a platform ID from Device Tree if it cannot be sourced from platform data. This ensures that the driver can work correctly with both platform data and DT.

3. Simplification of code: The patch removes unnecessary checks for platform data and executes the DT case only when platform data is not available. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

4. Proper error handling: The patch adds proper error handling by returning -ENODEV when both platform data and DT are missing. This ensures that the driver fails gracefully and provides a meaningful error message.

5. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Lee Jones and Linus Walleij, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, the patch addresses a regression, improves code simplicity, and provides proper error handling. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the "mixer_wait_for_vblank" function in the "exynos_mixer.c" file.

2. It ensures that the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable is cleared by expecting the upcoming vsync interrupt handler routine to do so.

3. The patch calls "drm_vblank_get" to increment the vblank reference count for the specified pipe.

4. It sets the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable to 1.

5. It waits for the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable to be cleared, with a timeout of HZ/20 (one-twentieth of a second).

6. If the wait times out, it prints a debug message.

7. Finally, the patch calls "drm_vblank_put" to decrement the vblank reference count for the specified pipe.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a functional improvement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to dropping the voltage to Vmin when the Gfx is power gated for the latest VLV revision. The patch drops a workaround that is no longer needed for the latest VLV revision and instead requests the minimum frequency to bring the voltage Vnn.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug related to power gating and voltage control, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a critical bug related to data corruption. The patch ensures that the timestamp is set as the last element in the channel specification, which is necessary for correct interpretation of the data by userspace code reading the buffer via sysfs.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it is safer to turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator since the driver will turn off the regcache_cache_only after enabling the regulator. This suggests that there might be an issue if cache_only is not turned on before disabling the regulator.

2. The patch mentions that if cache_only is not turned on, some commands like 'amixer cset' would fail if run before wm8962_resume(). This indicates that there might be a bug or issue related to the cache_only setting.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch adds the line "regcache_cache_only(wm8962->regmap, true);" before the call to "regulator_bulk_disable()". This sets the cache_only flag to true before disabling the regulator.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses a potential issue related to the cache_only flag and ensures that it is set correctly before disabling the regulator. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it addresses a specific bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes incorrect directory entries after fsync log replay, resulting in directories having multiple hard links, which is illegal in Linux. This issue can lead to data corruption and file system inconsistencies.

2. The bug can cause "oh, that's not good" issues: The sample reproducer demonstrates that attempting to remove the affected directories becomes impossible, leading to stale file handles and inaccessible directories.

3. The patch fixes the bug by ensuring that the last_unlink_trans value is set for the inode during rename operations, even for directories. Additionally, if the new parent directory is logged, a fallback to a transaction commit is performed.

4. The patch includes a test case for fstests, indicating that it has been tested and verified.

Considering these factors, the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and file system inconsistencies. It does not contain any trivial fixes and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of the exit code -1 with the portable value EXIT_FAILURE. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a general protection fault (GPF) in the `flush_to_ldisc()` function. The previous commit already addressed the issue for line disciplines that do not define a `receive_buf()` method. However, this patch aims to fix the same problem in the `tty_ldisc_receive_buf()` function, which is used by the vt driver and speakup driver to push selection data directly to the line discipline's `receive_buf()` method.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a GPF. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a bug in the ocfs2_file_aio_write() function in the ocfs2 file system. The bug occurs when ocfs2_inode_lock() fails, causing the function to skip unlocking the rw lock, which can lead to issues in ocfs2_lock_res_free().

Considering that this bug can potentially cause data corruption or other critical issues, it appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) L2 header check in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to make the L2 header check more generic by considering the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug reported by Shlomo Pongratz, where the GRO L2 header check fails on IB/ipoib traffic. This bug can be considered a real and critical issue.

2. The patch modifies the __napi_gro_receive() function in the net/core/dev.c file.

3. The patch introduces a new variable, maclen, which stores the hard_header_len value of the skb (socket buffer).

4. The patch adds conditional checks based on the value of maclen. If maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length), it uses the existing compare_ether_header() function to compare the L2 headers of the packets. Otherwise, if maclen is non-zero and there are no other differences between the packets, it uses memcmp() to compare the L2 headers.

5. The patch updates the NAPI_GRO_CB structure for each packet, setting the same_flow flag based on the comparison result.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the GRO L2 header check. It introduces a more generic approach to handle different L2 header lengths, improving compatibility with IB/ipoib traffic. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria for inclusion.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a mis-merge in gmap handling for the s390 architecture in the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that some changes were dropped during a previous merge, which caused KVM to fail for certain memory sizes, specifically 2GB.

The patch itself modifies the gmap_map_segment() function in the gmap.c file. It updates the condition for checking the validity of the memory range by subtracting 1 from the calculated end address. This change ensures that the memory range does not exceed the maximum allowed size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could cause KVM to fail for specific memory sizes. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The ATPX method may not always exist on the dGPU and could be located at the iGPU instead. This causes a conflict with port PM and prevents the dGPU from powering on.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug. This indicates that it is addressing a known issue.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-and-tested-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by a user.

4. The patch includes "Signed-off-by" tags from multiple developers, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the patch.

5. The patch modifies the code to correctly handle the bridge power management (bridge_d3) based on the parent device of the iGPU.

6. The patch also adds a check for d3_supported, which is set based on the bridge_d3 status of the parent device. This ensures that the bridge power management is usable.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to power management and ensures proper functionality. It meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is a revert of a previous commit that fixed a boundary check issue in the ioremap function for ARM architecture.
2. The revert is requested by a user who reported that the original fix caused booting issues on their custom AT91RM9200 board.
3. The user provided debugging information that clearly shows the incorrect behavior caused by the original fix.
4. The analysis reveals that the if condition in the original fix is incorrect, leading to incorrect mapping assumptions.
5. Additionally, it is mentioned that the original premise of the fix was wrong, as the code already handles the requested offset into the page.
6. The patch is acked by Nicolas Pitre, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch reverts a problematic fix and resolves the reported booting issue. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make dropped packets consume the NAPI budget in the octeon-ethernet staging driver. This is done to ensure that the NAPI handler does not run for an extended period.

2. Patch Impact: The patch addresses a potential issue where the NAPI handler may run for too long if dropped packets are not counted. This could lead to performance degradation or other issues.

3. Patch Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Aaro Koskinen and Jason A. Donenfeld, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Code Changes: The patch introduces two changes in the code:
   a. Line 303: Adds a line to increment the rx_count variable.
   b. Line 429: Removes the existing rx_count increment.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a potential issue and has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors. It does not contain any trivial fixes and aligns with the criteria for inclusion in -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential lost wakeup scenario in the staging driver "quatech_usb2" when using the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl. The patch addresses a race condition between the qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status.

The patch modifies the code by adding a barrier, setting the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, and checking for changes in the modem status. If there is no change, it returns an error (-EIO), and if there is a change in the requested modem status, it returns success (0).

Considering the patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a lost wakeup scenario, it can be categorized as fixing a "real and critical bug." Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch improves PM runtime and phy handling for the 2430 glue layer in the USB MUSB driver.
2. It simplifies the code by allowing idling both MUSB and PHY when nothing is configured.
3. The patch returns early from PM runtime if MUSB is not yet initialized, which is a good improvement.
4. It adds a warning if the PHY is not configured, which helps in identifying potential issues.
5. The patch initializes the PHY in the omap2430_musb_init() function.
6. It removes the redundant phy_init() and phy_power_on() calls in omap2430_musb_init().
7. The omap2430_musb_enable() function now checks if the PHY is not NULL before calling phy_power_on().
8. The omap2430_musb_disable() function also checks if the PHY is not NULL before calling phy_power_off().
9. The patch removes the phy_power_off() call from omap2430_musb_exit() and adds a NULL assignment to musb->phy.
10. It cancels the omap_musb_mailbox_work in omap2430_remove() and assigns NULL to musb->phy.
11. The omap2430_runtime_suspend() function now returns early if musb is NULL.
12. The omap2430_runtime_resume() function returns 0 if musb is NULL.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to improve the PM runtime and phy handling for the 2430 glue layer in the USB MUSB driver. It simplifies the code and removes redundant calls. It also adds necessary checks and warnings. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VCE ring test on Big-Endian systems. The patch ensures that every write to the ring is translated to little-endian. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as build errors, hangs, or data corruption. It also addresses a specific issue related to Big-Endian systems, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

Furthermore, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on the critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called get_random_long() to provide a source of randomness that operates the same as get_random_int() but returns an unsigned long value. This addition is necessary to support systems that require more than 32 bits of randomness.

2. The shifting constant in mmap_rnd() is fixed to be an unsigned long, ensuring that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is important for x86 systems, as values over 31 would otherwise disable mmap_base randomization.

3. Calls to get_random_int() are replaced with get_random_long() where appropriate, ensuring consistent usage of the new function.

Overall, this patch addresses a real issue related to randomness generation and ensures proper functionality on systems that require more than 32 bits of randomness. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to calling xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice on a V4 superblock, which leads to setting both pquotino and gquotino to NULLFSINO. This behavior can cause issues.

2. The patch makes it safe to call xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice and removes the extra calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk.

3. The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the sb_from_disk change occurred after V5 became the default. Therefore, this issue only exists on a V4 superblock.

4. The patch has been reported by Eryu Guan and reviewed by Carlos Maiolino, providing additional validation.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the irq_domain_add() function. The current sanity check in the function tests whether desc->irq_data is not NULL or irq_data->domain is not NULL. This check prevents adding an irq_domain to an irq descriptor when irq_data exists, which is true when the irq descriptor already exists.

However, the check for irq_data == NULL is not separated, which can lead to confusion and potential issues. The patch splits the check for irq_data == NULL and adds a separate warning for it.

The patch also includes proper attribution and references to related discussions and mailing lists.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential bug and improves code clarity. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a temporary fix for an infinite loop issue in the Exynos DRM driver when using a multi-platform kernel. The patch checks if the machine is compatible with certain Exynos SoC models and only registers the Exynos DRM device object if it is. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a workaround for a specific issue related to multi-platform support.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses two audio bugs, which can be considered real and critical issues.
2. The first bug is a long-standing issue where changing the audio encoding inadvertently changes the input as well. This bug has always been present.
3. The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and broke the default_audio_input module option handling, preventing the audio encoding from switching to AC3 if default_audio_input was set to 2 (SPDIF input).
4. The patch also mentions that since kernel 3.10, the audio encoding is always set at the start, making the first bug always happen when the driver is loaded. Previously, this bug would only surface if the user changed the audio encoding after the driver was loaded.
5. The patch includes a small trivial fix for a typo (bufffer -> buffer).

Considering that the patch addresses real and critical audio bugs, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the trace_marker file adds the trace mark to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer.

2. Impact: This issue does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the functionality of the trace_marker file.

3. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the `tracing_mark_write` function in the `kernel/trace/trace.c` file. It adds a new variable `tr` of type `struct trace_array` to hold the instance's buffer. The `buffer` variable is then updated to use the instance's buffer instead of the global trace buffer.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. It is more of an improvement or bug fix for a specific functionality. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch avoids a duplicate call to `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` for `ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE` within `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. This duplication is unnecessary since it already occurs once during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation.

2. The patch removes the local `conn->stat_sn` assignment and increment, indicating that this should be handled by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

3. The third parameter of `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` is changed to signal that the assignment and increment of `cmd->stat_sn` should be done by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

4. The patch includes a `Tested-by` tag indicating that it has been tested by Moussa Ba.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to duplicate calls and unnecessary assignments. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the `of_get_display_timings()` function in the `drivers/video/of_display_timing.c` file. The patch adds a `kfree(dt)` statement to free the memory allocated for `dt` in case `of_parse_display_timing()` fails.

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is a revert of a previous commit that claimed throughput improvement for MSC/UVC but did not show significant improvement in measurements. Additionally, the commit introduced two regressions:

1. The ASIX usb-ethernet dongle is completely broken on UDP RX.
2. Unplugging a 3G modem behind a hub causes console log flooding with an error message.

Since the patch reverts the commit that introduced these regressions, it is likely to fix the issues and improve the stability of the system. The changes in the patch do not include any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug report states that when DDW (64-bit direct DMA on Power) is not enabled for NVMe devices, a fallback to 32-bit DMA via the IOMMU occurs, which uses 4K TCEs. However, the NVMe device driver assumes that the DMA alignment for the PRP entries matches the device's page size, causing a bug in nvme_setup_prps().

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch changes the default device page size to 4K, which matches the IOMMU's page size. This ensures that the DMA alignment for the PRP entries matches the device's page size, preventing the bug from occurring.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a functional issue and does not include trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has been tested: The patch has been tested with a hardware test exerciser, and it is reported that the kernel no longer encounters a bug within a few minutes of testing.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the selection of the default overall mode for the ELF FP ABI in the MIPS architecture. The bug causes a kernel panic when CONFIG_MIPS_O32_FP64_SUPPORT is enabled and binaries without PT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS program header and associated .MIPS.abiflags section are used.

The patch addresses this issue by moving the selection of the default overall mode to the start of arch_check_elf, ensuring that a default mode is selected regardless of the presence of PT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS program header.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that attempted to fix a reported issue with the "capacity_now" value being higher than the "full_charge_capacity" value when the battery is fully charged.

2. The patch author argues that it is not unexpected for "capacity_now" to increase above "full_charge_capacity" due to variations in charging cycles and battery firmware behavior. Good battery firmwares may update "full_charge_capacity" when the current charging cycle is complete, even increasing it if necessary.

3. The patch claims that capping "capacity_now" to "full_charge_capacity" is incorrect and that printing a warning if they don't match the "design_capacity" is both annoying and wrong.

4. The patch explains that the current behavior results in bogus warnings on perfectly working systems/firmwares and incorrect values being reported for "capacity_now" and "full_charge_capacity" after the warning has been triggered.

5. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag and is signed-off by the patch author and the relevant maintainers.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the previous commit was addressing a non-existent issue and causing unnecessary warnings and incorrect values. Reverting the commit would restore the expected behavior and eliminate the reported problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Linus Torvalds, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.
5. The patch is signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.

Therefore, considering the critical bug fix, the potential issues it resolves, and the positive review and testing, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to sparse warnings in the drivers/of/platform.c file. The patch changes the type of the "reg" variable from "const u32 *" to "const __be32 *". 

Since this patch is addressing a sparse warning and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an unbalanced mutex issue in the dma_pool_create() function. The bug was introduced in the 3.16 kernel version. 

The patch itself adds a fix by setting the 'retval' variable to NULL in the error case, ensuring that the mutex is unlocked before returning. This addresses the unbalanced mutex issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the arm64 architecture. The bug causes a regression in the coarse clock monotonicity, which can lead to incorrect timestamps being obtained via the VDSO interface.

The patch addresses the issue by modifying the update_vsyscall function in the vdso.c file. It replaces the usage of __current_kernel_time() with the timekeeper object provided by the timekeeping core. This ensures that the correct time values are used for the coarse clock.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can impact the accuracy of timestamps obtained through the VDSO interface on arm64 architecture.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro to export module alias information for the "b53_mmap" driver. This change allows user-space to match the registered device with the corresponding module when the driver is built as a module.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a kernel crash when unloading the i2c-hid driver. The crash occurs because the command buffer is released before attempting to power down the device.

The patch modifies the i2c_hid_stop() function by removing the call to i2c_hid_free_buffers(). This change ensures that the buffers are not freed when unloading the i2c-hid driver.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a kernel crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a regression that causes harm even after previous attempts to fix it.
2. It addresses a bug related to flushing the PTEs before suspend.
3. The patch includes a Bugzilla reference and has been tested by ming.yao@intel.com.
4. It has been reviewed and signed-off by Chris Wilson, Jani Nikula, and Daniel Vetter.
5. It includes changes to the i915_gem_gtt.c file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to suspending and flushing PTEs. It also has undergone testing and review. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the IPI domain in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a crash when ipi_destroy() is called on a multi-cpu system, as it attempts to free cpumask_weight() IRQs that were never allocated. 

The patch sets the IRQ_NO_BALANCING flag to prevent the affinity from being overwritten by setup_affinity(), ensuring that the affinity mask is not modified before the IPI is destroyed. This fix addresses the issue and prevents the crash.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to modify the acpi_find_child_device() function in the ACPI/scan module. Currently, if there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope, the first one found to be present is returned. However, this behavior is not defined by the spec, and it may not match the ASL writers' expectations.

The patch suggests modifying the find_child_checks() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change aims to cover the special case where devices without valid ACPI/PNP device IDs should be matched against a given bus address first.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be an improvement to handle a specific case that violates the ACPI specification.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is a port of a previous fix for ARMv7 to ARMv8. It fixes the broken evtype mask to include the NSH bit, allowing profiling at EL2.

2. Impact: The patch addresses a bug in the ARMv8 architecture that affects event selection for profiling. Without this fix, profiling at EL2 would not be possible.

3. Criticality: The bug addressed by the patch does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does fix an issue that affects the functionality of profiling at EL2, which can be considered a critical bug.

4. Triviality: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-trivial fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to memory leaks on resume_latency.notifiers.
2. It mentions that the behavior was changed in a previous commit, but the notifiers field of latency_tolerance is never used.
3. The patch restores the original behavior of freeing the notifiers pointer on qos->resume_latency, which is used.
4. It fixes a kmemleak warning related to an unreferenced object.
5. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the issue.
6. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch fixes a real and critical bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array. This bug could be exploited by a malicious device lacking the expected endpoints. Therefore, this patch addresses a potential security issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes the unnecessary `enable_lock` spinlock in the `imx-tve` driver. The patch mentions that the DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, which prevents concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions. Additionally, holding a spinlock while calling `clk_prepare_enable()` is incorrect and can cause a warning if debugging is enabled.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it is a trivial fix that removes unnecessary code, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the stk_camera_read_reg() function in the stk-webcam driver.
2. It allocates a buffer using kmalloc() to store the USB control message response.
3. The usb_control_msg() function is called to send a control message to the USB device and retrieve the value of a register.
4. The response is copied to the buffer using memcpy().
5. The buffer is freed using kfree().
6. The function returns the result of usb_control_msg().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential issue with using a stack-allocated buffer for DMA operations. By allocating a buffer using kmalloc(), the patch ensures that the buffer is in a DMA-enabled area. This is a critical fix as using a stack-allocated buffer for DMA can lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to DMA usage in the stk-webcam driver.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes two issues:
   a. It adds a check for the return value of `rpc_clone_client()` and handles the case where it fails.
   b. It ensures that the cloned `rpc_clnt` is shut down in the case where `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` replaces the original value of 'client', preventing a memory leak.

2. The patch simplifies the code by moving the call to `rpc_clone_client()` after `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` has completed its operations.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Andy Adamson.

4. The patch is signed-off by Trond Myklebust, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to NFSv4 and improves the code's correctness and simplicity. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to avoid select_idle_sibling() from picking a sibling thread if there's an idle core that shares cache. This is done to fix SMT balancing in cases where there's a shared cache core available to balance to.

2. Tested-by: The patch has been tested by Mike Galbraith, which indicates that it has undergone testing and validation.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Peter Zijlstra and Ingo Molnar, indicating their approval and agreement with the changes.

4. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch modify the select_idle_sibling() function in the kernel/sched_fair.c file.

5. Analysis of Code Changes: The code changes introduce a new variable "smt" and a new label "again". The patch modifies the for_each_domain loop to handle cases where SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER is set and there is an idle CPU available. It also adds a loop to iterate through sched_groups and find an eligible idle CPU.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to SMT balancing and improves the selection of idle siblings. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

(B) The patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

2. The patch introduces a new helper function called "nvme_set_queue_limits" that sets the queue limits for the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This is important because without this helper, the command size on the admin queue is arbitrarily low, which can lead to issues.

3. The helper function applies various queue limits to the admin queue, such as maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush requirements, and virtual boundary. These limits ensure proper functioning and prevent potential issues like data corruption or hangs.

4. The patch is applied in two places: during controller initialization (nvme_init_identify) and when allocating a new namespace (nvme_alloc_ns). This ensures that the queue limits are set correctly for both the admin queue and I/O queues.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue related to queue limits for the admin queue in the NVMe driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 platforms. The patch description explains that using the dummy clock with a rate of zero can lead to misconfigured timings and devices being lost on the bus.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause misconfigurations and device loss. It does not appear to be a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for defining and using an explicit "CONNECTED" state in the libceph module. The patch adds the CONNECTED state and updates the relevant code to set and clear this state appropriately.

From the description, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new state to improve the clarity and maintainability of the code.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup or a code readability improvement. As per the guidelines, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the USB gadget serial driver. The patch adds a check for the 'port->port_usb' pointer before accessing it to avoid the crash.

Since this patch addresses a potential crash, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects an allocation size issue in the watchdog core. The patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The current code generates lots of warnings when the system is run with the kernel 'threadirqs' option selected. This indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The bug causes warnings: The warnings indicate a potential problem in the code, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch uses in_interrupt() instead of in_irq(): The patch replaces the use of in_irq() with in_interrupt() to check the context. This change allows for either type of interrupt and avoids the warnings generated in the previous code.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: The patch has been reviewed and tested by Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

5. The patch is related to the DRM subsystem: The patch is specific to the DRM subsystem, which suggests that it addresses a critical issue related to graphics display.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. The patch aims to use a stored value for the maximum voltage (max_vddc) instead of looking it up manually each time.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ni_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `ni_dpm.c` and the `rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `rv770_dpm.c`. These functions are responsible for parsing power tables and adjusting voltage values if necessary.

2. The patch removes the variable `vddc` from both functions since it is no longer needed.

3. In both functions, if the voltage value (`pl->vddc`) is equal to `0xff01`, the patch checks if `pi->max_vddc` is non-zero. If it is, the patch assigns `pi->max_vddc` to `pl->vddc`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to voltage adjustment in the power management code for Radeon GPUs. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of the code and removes unnecessary variables.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to guest MMU changes in the KVM MIPS implementation. The patch ensures that TLB entries are correctly invalidated on SMP hosts when a guest is migrated to a different physical CPU. It also takes care to only invalidate valid TLB entries and only for the kernel ASID when the virtual address is outside the guest user address range.

The patch introduces a new function, "kvm_mips_invalidate_guest_tlb," which is called to indicate a change in guest MMU mappings. This function invalidates both user and kernel host ASIDs on other CPUs, causing new ASIDs to be generated when the guest runs on those CPUs. Additionally, the patch modifies the existing functions "kvm_mips_emul_tlbwi" and "kvm_mips_emul_tlbwr" to use the new "kvm_mips_invalidate_guest_tlb" function.

Considering the nature of the bug being fixed and the changes made in the patch, it appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK) in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable, causing the device to not wake up for important events.

Given that this patch addresses a real and critical issue with potential data loss or functionality problems, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on reverting the problematic change.

However, it is important to note that further investigation may be required to identify the root cause of the issue and find a more reliable solution in the future.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch is focused on fixing the length calculation for ethtool statistics in the qlcnic driver. While it may improve the accuracy of the statistics, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic error in the original implementation of the code. The patch corrects the clock disable logic in the sdhi and mmcif drivers. 

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause issues such as hangs or data corruption, it meets the criteria for being considered for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the fix does not seem to be trivial, as it involves modifying the logic of the clock disable operation.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the configuration of the FTLB (First Level Translation Buffer) on certain MIPS cores (proAptiv, P5600).
2. The issue is that the FTLB probability is calculated based on zero sizes of the TLBs, resulting in a suboptimal FTLB:VTLB write ratio.
3. The patch proposes to configure the FTLB probability after decoding config4, ensuring that the TLB sizes are properly considered.
4. To achieve this, the set_ftlb_enable function is modified to accept flags indicating whether to enable the FTLB and whether to configure the write probability.
5. The decode_configs function is updated to call set_ftlb_enable with the appropriate flags, considering whether the FTLB is disabled or not.
6. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Fixes tags, as well as the Patchwork and Cc information.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the FTLB configuration on certain MIPS cores. It fixes an issue that can lead to suboptimal use of available FTLB resources. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix the wrong minimal dump size obtained from rtnl_calcit() function in RT netlink. Currently, the function does not account for the size of the header of the netlink message, and this patch aims to fix that.

2. Impact: The issue addressed by the patch does not seem to cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or correctness improvement.

3. Patch content: The patch modifies the rtnl_calcit() function by changing the return statement from "return min_ifinfo_dump_size;" to "return nlmsg_total_size(min_ifinfo_dump_size);". This change ensures that the size of the netlink message header is accounted for when calculating the minimal dump size.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any real issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "xHCI: Clear PLC for USB2 root hub ports" and provides a fix for clearing the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports.

2. Problem Statement: The issue being addressed is that when the link state changes, the xHC (xHCI host controller) reports a port status change event and sets the PORT_PLC bit for both USB3 and USB2 root hub ports. However, the PLC is cleared by usbcore for USB3 root hub ports but not for USB2 ports because they do not report USB_PORT_STAT_C_LINK_STATE in wPortChange.

3. Patch Details: The patch adds a check in the handle_port_status() function to clear the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports if the hcd (host controller driver) speed is not HCD_USB3.

4. Patch Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Andiry Xu, Sarah Sharp, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to clearing the PLC bit for USB2 root hub ports. It does not seem to be a trivial fix as it involves modifying the handle_port_status() function. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to USB2 root hub ports and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in the USB gadget driver. The issue is caused by the premature assignment of the 'gadget' variable before the waiting process is completed. The patch resolves this by moving the assignment after the waiting process.

Considering the patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to a non-existent VGA port on a Fujitsu D3003-S2 board. The bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists the VGA port incorrectly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, the bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists a non-existent VGA port, which can cause issues.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the bug may not directly cause any of the mentioned issues, it can lead to incorrect behavior or confusion for users trying to use the VGA port.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch adds a specific quirk for the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board to handle the incorrect VGA port listing in the Vbios connector table.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug that can cause confusion and incorrect behavior for users.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function call in the lpc_eth.c driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "KVM: vmx: Inject #GP on invalid PAT CR". It suggests that the patch aims to inject a general protection fault (#GP) when a guest sets the Page Attribute Table Control Register (PAT CR) to an invalid value.

2. The patch checks if the vmx supports loading the PAT CR during entry. If it does, the patch proceeds with the required check.

3. The check is performed using the function `kvm_mtrr_valid()`, which is defined in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c`. This function validates the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) for the given MSR (Model Specific Register) and data.

4. If the `kvm_mtrr_valid()` function returns false, indicating that the MTRR is not valid, the patch returns 1, indicating failure.

5. The patch is signed-off by Nadav Amit and Paolo Bonzini.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the PAT CR and ensures that an invalid value triggers a #GP. It also introduces a necessary check using the `kvm_mtrr_valid()` function.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to guest behavior and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to power-saving (PS) idle behavior in the ath9k wireless driver. The patch corrects an inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK, ensuring that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission is pending.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug in the PS idle behavior, which can impact power consumption and overall system performance.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? No, the bug does not fall into any of these categories.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? No, the patch addresses a specific bug and does not include any trivial changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel oops triggered by dereferencing a NULL Rx skb. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and hdelta is just a little larger than half a buffer time (e.g., in a ping-pong buffer). In such cases, the current condition wrongly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this issue, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that the condition is not triggered when hdelta is only slightly larger than half a buffer time.

The patch also mentions that jiffies, which is used for hdelta calculation, is not high resolution and may have inaccuracies. This comment highlights the need to consider the inaccuracy of jiffies when evaluating the condition.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario where the current condition fails to handle interrupts correctly. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata. The current implementation uses the padded length instead of the real length, which is a bug according to the specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all specified metadata has been 32-bit, where aligned and data length are the same width. However, it is still important to fix this bug to adhere to the specification.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it is fine to include it in the patch.

3. The patch gets rid of magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the bug fix.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug in the encoding of metadata and improves code quality. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

     - `mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_STATUS, ~0, MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC);`
     - `mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_EN, ~0, MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC);`
   - The changes indicate that the vsync interrupt is being enabled and the vsync indicator is being cleared before configuring vsync.

6. Changes in mixer_disable_vblank():
   - The patch adds the line `mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_STATUS, ~0, MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC);` before disabling the vsync interrupt.
   - This change clears the vsync indicator before disabling the interrupt.

7. Changes in mixer_enable():
   - The patch adds an if condition to check if the MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC flag is set in the ctx->int_en variable.
   - If the flag is set, the vsync indicator is cleared using `mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_STATUS, ~0, MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC);`.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to vsync configuration in the DRM Exynos mixer driver. It ensures that the vsync indicator is cleared before configuring vsync and also before disabling the vsync interrupt.

The patch addresses this issue by ensuring that the cm_id_priv structure is erased only once before freeing it. It includes modifications in the cm_destroy_id() and ib_send_cm_sidr_rep() functions to handle the erasure correctly.

Considering that the patch fixes a real bug that can lead to potential memory corruption and use-after-free scenarios, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to support NR_CPUS = 4096 on SPARC64 platforms.
2. Currently, NR_CPUS is limited to 4064 due to the allocation of a single page for NR_CPUS mondo entries in init_cpu_send_mondo_info().
3. The proposed fix is to allocate (2^order) pages based on the size of cpu_list for possible CPUs.
4. The patch ensures that cpu_list_pa and cpu_mondo_block_pa, which are not used in asm code, do not break imm13 offsets from the base PA.
5. The patch includes a bug reference (Orabug: 25505750) and is signed-off by multiple contributors.
6. The patch modifies the range of NR_CPUS in the Kconfig file to allow a maximum of 4096 CPUs for SPARC64 platforms.
7. In the irq_64.c file, the init_cpu_send_mondo_info() function is modified to align the mondo block to 64 bytes and allocate the cpu_list page correctly.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical issue by allowing the use of all 4096 CPUs on SPARC platforms. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any potential issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

   - The mutex lock is released.

4. Analysis:
   - The patch appears to fix the power-saving wrappers in the ath9k_set_coverage_class function.
   - It ensures that the PS state is properly handled during the configuration of parameters and the execution of REG_READ and REG_RMW operations.
   - The patch does not seem to address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.
   - It also does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch seems to be a non-critical fix that does not address any significant issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The kernfs_deactivate() function in the kernel forgot to check whether KERNFS_LOCKDEP is set before performing lockdep annotations. This can lead to uninitialized lockdep_map being fed to lockdep, triggering warnings and potentially causing issues like the USB stick hotunplug warning mentioned in the report.

2. The bug can cause a "oh, that's not good" issue: The uninitialized lockdep_map can trigger warnings and potentially lead to unexpected behavior or instability in the system.

3. The patch fixes the bug by making kernfs_deactivate() perform lockdep annotations only if KERNFS_LOCKDEP is set. This ensures that the lockdep_map is properly initialized before being used.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Tejun Heo, who is a recognized kernel developer.

5. The bug has been reported by multiple individuals, including Fabio Estevam and Alan Stern, indicating that it is a real and critical issue.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is to accept the patch (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a failure to open PCM device with -ENOSYS in Terratec Phase 88. This indicates a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the device.

2. The patch addresses the issue by correctly setting the IDs for the Selector Function Blocks of the AVC Audio subunit. The current implementation incorrectly sets the IDs to 0, but the correct IDs are 9 and 8.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" and "Tested-by" tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by a user.

4. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases, as indicated by the "Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v3.16+" line.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that allowed PCH PWM override on IVB (Ivy Bridge) hardware. The reason for the revert is that it breaks the backlight controls on an Asus Zenbook with an eDP panel.

Given that this patch addresses a specific issue related to backlight controls on a specific hardware configuration, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing unlock on the error handle path in the `net2272_irq()` function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the memremap's helper function try_ram_remap(). Currently, the function dereferences a struct page pointer derived from a PFN (Page Frame Number) that is assumed to be valid and covered by the kernel direct mapping. However, this assumption may not hold true on all architectures, specifically ARM and arm64, where the 'System RAM' iomem region may include regions for which pfn_valid() returns false.

To fix this, the patch adds a check using pfn_valid() before calling pfn_to_page(). This ensures that both __va() and pfn_to_page() are only called on PFNs/physical addresses for which pfn_valid() returns true.

The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential issue related to PFN validity and ensures compatibility across architectures, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "net: macb: initialize checksum when using checksum offloading"
   - This patch aims to fix an issue related to checksum offloading in the macb network driver.

2. Changes since v2:
   - The patch author addressed a legitimate objection by not blindly modifying SKB contents.

3. Changes since v1:
   - The patch author dropped disabling HW checksum offload for Zynq.
   - The patch author initialized the checksum similar to net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c.

4. Patch details:
   - The patch adds a new inline function `macb_clear_csum` to clear the checksum field in the SKB structure.
   - The function checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled (`skb->ip_summed != CHECKSUM_PARTIAL`).
   - If checksum offloading is enabled, the function initializes the checksum field to 0.
   - The patch also modifies the `macb_start_xmit` function to call `macb_clear_csum` before transmitting the packet.
   - If `macb_clear_csum` fails, the packet is freed and the transmission is considered successful.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real issue related to checksum offloading in the macb network driver. It ensures that the checksum field is properly initialized, which is necessary for correct transmission in certain cases (e.g., Zynq with UDP packets). Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The code enabling the clock was removed from the probe function, resulting in a dysfunctional gpio controller when power management is disabled.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which indicates that it is intended to fix a specific problem.

4. The patch adds back the clock initialization to support CONFIG_PM=n, ensuring that the clock is enabled even when power management is disabled.

5. The patch also includes error handling for the clock initialization, enabling proper cleanup in case of failure.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including the original author and a stable maintainer.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an incorrect OOM (Out of Memory) return value and also improves error handling by returning early for clarity. However, it does not address any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Microsoft Surface docks that use the Realtek RTL8152 chip. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for a specific hardware device.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to false lockdep warnings in the ALSA PCM core. The patch addresses the problem by passing the lock subclass calculated from the depth in `snd_pcm_action_group()` and dropping a possibly wrong lock subclass set in `snd_pcm_action_lock_mutex()`.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to lockdep warnings, it can be considered a valid fix for a potential bug. However, without further information about the severity and impact of the false lockdep warnings, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation of the severity and impact of the false lockdep warnings before making a final decision on whether to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The patch addresses an error handling issue in the ftdi_sio driver related to reading the latency timer. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in USB serial communication.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve detecting short responses when reading the latency timer and avoiding the use of stale buffer data.

3. The patch includes relevant information: The patch includes a "Fixes" tag that references the commit that introduced the bug, providing a clear indication of the problem being addressed. It also includes a "Reviewed-by" tag from a recognized kernel developer, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and deemed appropriate.

4. The patch is signed-off by a recognized contributor: The patch is signed-off by Johan Hovold, who is listed as the maintainer of the ftdi_sio driver. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the relevant maintainer.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the I2C bus number for the IGEP's DVI connector. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing a call to `ieee80211_recalc_min_chandef()` in the `rate_control_rate_init()` function in the `rate.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch is fixing a context bug by removing the call, but it mentions that a different way to fix the minimum channel width issue needs to be found.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without further information about the bug being fixed and its impact, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a context bug and not directly fixing a critical issue. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is reverting a previous commit that merged the `table_ptr` and `cached_table` pointers in the `remoteproc` driver. The commit incorrectly made changes to the `virtio` config space only affect the local copy, instead of the shared resource table. The intention was to allow memory protection of the shared resource table.

The patch reverts the changes and restores the original behavior. It creates a copy of the resource table and assigns it to `cached_table`. The `table_ptr` is then set to point to the `cached_table`. When a virtio device starts, the address of the allocated vring will be stored in `cached_table`, and before the device is started, the `cached_table` will be copied into device memory. Any subsequent changes to the resource table will be applied to the loaded version.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the previous commit introduced a bug that affected the shared resource table and the communication with the remote device. The patch aims to fix this issue by reverting the changes and restoring the correct behavior.

Considering that the bug introduced by the previous commit can potentially cause critical issues such as data corruption or incorrect communication with the remote device, and the patch addresses this bug directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it fixes firmware loading errors on some systems that do not respond or give obscure values after cold, warm, or firmware reboot. This indicates a potential critical bug.

2. The patch retries to get the chip version and type five times. If it fails, it applies chip version 0x1 and type 0x9135. This retry mechanism improves the reliability of the chip identification process.

3. The patch does not fix warm cycle problems from other operating systems, and it suggests users power off cold boot instead. This information is relevant for users but does not directly affect the patch's criticality.

4. The patch modifies the "it913x_query" function to include the retry mechanism for chip version identification. It checks if the chip version is within the expected range (1 to 2) and sets the chip version and type accordingly. If the chip version is outside the expected range, it logs an error message and sets the chip version to 0x1 and type to 0x9135.

5. The patch modifies the "it913x_download_firmware" function to add error handling and logging. It checks the return value of the firmware download process and logs a failure message if it fails. It also adds a delay before rebooting the device and checks if the device responds to the reboot command. If the device fails to respond, it logs an error message and returns an error code.

6. The patch updates the module version to "1.28".

The patch modifies the function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` to return an integer value indicating success or failure. It also updates the function `do_register_framebuffer` and `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` to handle the return value of `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and propagate the error code if necessary.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical issue that could lead to kernel panics, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug when loading the cx88_dvb module for a Hauppauge HVR4000. This bug can cause crashes or other issues, making it a real and critical bug.

2. The patch is based on a bug report in the kernel bugzilla, which provides additional evidence of the bug's existence and the need for a fix.

3. The patch addresses the cause of the bug, which is that the wm8775 is optional, so checking whether the module was actually loaded is a safer approach.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The changes in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They involve modifying conditional statements and function calls to handle the optional module correctly.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a situation where the system fails in mysterious ways due to the inability to find enough memory to instantiate RTAS (Runtime Abstraction Services) during a network install.

2. The bug can cause various failures: The patch mentions that SMT threads, storage, and network were all completely broken due to this issue.

3. The patch introduces a panic mechanism: Instead of allowing the system to continue running in a potentially unstable state, the patch adds a panic call if RTAS exists and memory allocation for it fails. This ensures that the system immediately halts and notifies the user about the failure.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the critical bug.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes an issue related to the completion of the Control write status stage in the renesas_usbhs driver. The patch prevents the incorrect clearing of PID_BUF in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop() function, which can cause the controller to be unable to complete the status stage.

Considering that this issue can potentially lead to data corruption or incomplete control transfers, it can be classified as a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a significant issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file.

The purpose of the cond_resched() call was to allow scheduling in non-atomic contexts during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy(). However, it was found that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy() is called in atomic context, making scheduling not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386.

The patch removes the cond_resched() call and explains that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration, it is still better than using an if (in_atomic()) cond_resched() check to cover only non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific configuration issue and removes unnecessary code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect comparison in the powernow_k6_cpu_exit() function in the powernow-k6 driver.

2. The incorrect comparison is between 'i' (the loop index) and 'max_multiplier'. The patch correctly states that 'max_multiplier' should be compared with clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself.

3. Additionally, the patch replaces the hard-coded loop count of 8 with a condition that checks for CPUFREQ_TABLE_END. This makes the loop more flexible and avoids potential issues if the number of elements in clock_ratio changes in the future.

4. The patch includes a Reported-by tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Viresh Kumar, and Signed-off-by tags from Srivatsa S. Bhat and Rafael J. Wysocki.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug in the powernow-k6 driver and improves the code's flexibility.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rtc: handle errors correctly in rtc_irq_set_state()". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function.

2. The code checks the correctness of the parameters but unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer. This means that even if the parameters are incorrect, the hrtimer is still armed or disarmed.

3. The consequence of this behavior is that a random task might arm/disarm the rtc timer, surprising the real owner by either generating events or stopping them. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially impact system stability.

4. The patch adds an error handling mechanism by introducing a check for errors. If an error is detected, the function jumps to the "out" label, which releases the lock and returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function. It ensures that the hrtimer is not unconditionally armed or disarmed when there are errors. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a backport of changes made to the x86 pagefault handler for making it retryable and killable. The patch aims to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation on 64-bit sparc.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be an optimization for reducing mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would classify this patch as a performance optimization rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current vfio-pci code incorrectly checks the device type using the PCI_HEADER_TYPE value, which is used as an offset in the configuration space. However, this value is being used to mask the type value, leading to a mistake.

2. The patch fixes the issue by directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type instead of using the incorrect value.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Wei Yang and Alex Williamson, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is being considered for inclusion in stable releases.

5. The patch modifies the vfio_pci_probe() function, which is responsible for probing and initializing a VFIO PCI device.

6. The change in the patch is critical as it ensures that only normal PCI devices are supported by vfio-pci. This prevents potential issues with non-normal devices.

7. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to device type checking in vfio-pci. It does not introduce any trivial changes and is signed-off by contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c). Reverting a commit suggests that there was an issue with the original commit.

2. The patch claims that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large list of people with various gen2/3 hardware. This indicates that there is a real issue affecting a significant number of users.

3. The original patch is described as "complete non-sense" since the referenced bugzilla reports are about a different issue (gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits mismatch) and not related to the dither bit. This suggests that the original patch was incorrect and did not address the reported issue.

4. The patch includes changes in two files: intel_lvds.c and intel_panel.c. The changes in intel_lvds.c ensure that the dither state is correctly set for gen2/3 hardware. This is important for maintaining compatibility and preventing any potential issues related to dithering.

5. The changes in intel_panel.c ensure that pre-965 hardware sets dither correctly for 18bpp panels. This is another important fix to ensure proper display rendering.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware and ensures correct dithering for pre-965 hardware with 18bpp panels. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to handling level interrupts in the KVM virtualization subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes duplicate code. The patch removes the resource check and error handling code from multiple drivers and relies on the sanity checks performed by the `devm_ioremap_resource` function instead.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability and maintainability, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a build error caused by a conflict with the identifier "ffs" in the code. The patch converts the "ffs" macro from an object-like macro to a function-like macro to avoid this conflict.

Since the build error is causing a failure in the compilation process, it can be considered a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical issue that causes a build error.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to restarting the device and handling requests to stop transmission aggregation. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a security risk. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and its impact, and I will be able to give a more accurate assessment of whether the patch should be accepted in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds locking using zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, preventing invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to invalid memory access. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses the issue of checking the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit of dev->flags in usbnet_stop() before it is cleared when dev->flags is set to 0.

2. The problem was identified by Oliver Neukum and the fix was provided by Eugene Shatokhin.

3. The patch modifies the usbnet_stop() function in the usbnet.c file.

4. It introduces a new variable "mpn" to store the value of the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit before it is cleared.

5. The usbnet_purge_paused_rxq() function is called to purge any paused receive queues.

6. The patch checks the value of "mpn" to determine whether to call the info->manage_power() function or not.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to the handling of the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit in usbnet_stop(). It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug caused incorrect antenna selection when BT (Bluetooth) is active, which could lead to disturbances and connectivity issues on certain devices.

2. The bug fix is necessary for devices with a single antenna: The patch specifically mentions that devices like the 3160 couldn't connect at all when BT was active. This indicates that the bug fix is critical for such devices.

3. The patch includes a reference to a bug report: The patch references Bugzilla bug #97181, which suggests that the issue has been reported and acknowledged.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the antenna selection logic in the code.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, and it meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a list corruption issue in urb dequeue at host removal in the xhci driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential bug.

2. The patch description explains that the xhci driver frees data for all devices, both USB2 and USB3, the first time usb_remove_hcd() is called. However, when usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus, it tries to dequeue all pending urbs and touches td_list, which has already been freed for that endpoint. This indicates a potential issue that can lead to list corruption.

3. The patch includes the necessary metadata, such as the Cc (carbon copy) and Signed-off-by fields, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

4. The code changes in the patch modify the xhci_urb_dequeue() function in the xhci.c file. It adds a condition to the for loop, checking if xhci->devs[urb->dev->slot_id] is valid before continuing the loop. This change ensures that the loop does not access freed memory, addressing the potential list corruption issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause list corruption, which can lead to various issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and has been reviewed and tested.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds status and return request handlers for the wiimote HID driver. This indicates that it is adding functionality to handle status reports and return reports from the wiimote.

2. The patch mentions that the wiimote resets the current drm when an extension is plugged in. To keep the drm consistent, the patch resets the drm on every status report.

3. The patch also handles return reports from the wiimote, indicating the success or failure of requests that have been sent.

4. The patch includes the necessary function definitions for handling status and return reports.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding important functionality to handle status and return reports from the wiimote, ensuring the consistency of the drm. It also handles return reports, which can indicate the success or failure of requests. This patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a reported bug by Chris Metcalf, where sched_can_stop_tick() sometimes fails to re-enable the tick.
2. The patch provides a fix for the observed problem, where rq->cfs.nr_running can be 1 even though there are multiple runnable CFS tasks.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to qeth (QDIO Ethernet) devices on the s390 architecture. The patch allows for the preservation of blkt (block size) changes during online settings.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, it addresses a specific issue where blkt changes are reset during online settings, which can cause undesired behavior.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - It does not seem to introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a false-positive warning issue in the dev_pm_domain_set() function. The issue occurs when attempting to clear the pm_domain pointer after invoking the driver's ->remove() callback, leading to unnecessary warnings.

The patch addresses this by checking if the pointer passed to dev_pm_domain_set() is NULL and skipping the warning in that case.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a fix for a false-positive warning, which falls under the category of a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drivers/tty: require read access for controlling terminal" and is described as a hardening fix. It aims to prevent write-only access to other users' ttys, which is typically only granted through setgid tty executables.

2. The patch modifies the `tty_open` function in `tty_io.c`. It adds a check to ensure that a process that only has write access to the tty cannot obtain the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. If the file mode (`f_mode`) of the file descriptor includes the `FMODE_READ` flag, the `__proc_set_tty` function is called to set the tty as the controlling terminal.

3. The patch also modifies the `tiocsctty` function in `tty_io.c`. It adds a similar check to prevent a process without read access to the file descriptor from setting the tty as the controlling terminal. If the file mode does not include the `FMODE_READ` flag and the process does not have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, the function returns `-EPERM` to indicate a permission error.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential security issue by ensuring that write-only access to ttys does not grant full privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. The changes are not trivial and do not involve spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves managing the WM8731 ACTIVE bit as a supply widget. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to adjusting the display configuration after power state changes in the amdgpu driver. 

The patch itself does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an improvement or adjustment rather than fixing a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to truncating a file in the overlay filesystem (overlayfs). It introduces a check for write access on the underlying inode before performing the truncation. This check is done both on the lower file (before copy-up) and the upper file (after copy-up) for consistency.

The patch also includes a test case to verify the fix, which checks if truncating a file using the `truncate()` system call fails as expected.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to truncating files in overlayfs, ensuring proper write access checks.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues. It is more of a correctness and consistency improvement.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a necessary check for write access.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a mislabeled USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) in the ftdi_sio driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The original implementation of sendfile(2) made it unkillable for a long time when performing a lot of tiny writes into a filesystem. This issue was fixed in a previous commit, but there is still a problem when sendfile(2) is used to issue lots of writes into arbitrary file descriptors that do not hit the standard filesystem write path.

2. The patch provides a fix for the problem: It adds a test for pending signals into the splice_from_pipe_next() function, which is responsible for handling the data transfer in sendfile(2). This ensures that the process can be killed even when there are always buffers available.

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch description states that commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, which can be problematic since some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot. This indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The patch sets the IRQ type to the rising edge if it is not already configured. This ensures that the IRQ trigger is properly set, even on boards where it may have been disabled.

3. The patch then requests the IRQ with the updated IRQ type, using devm_request_irq().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to IRQ setup. It ensures that the IRQ trigger is properly configured, which can prevent potential issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a critical bug related to the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in MCG paravirtualization. The issue arises when a client re-register event triggers the cleanup of all MCGs. However, since the cleanup is performed in a work queue, there is a possibility that the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) could leave and re-join groups before the cleanup occurs. This leads to the cleanup pruning the newly-joined MCGs, leaving the ULP without the actual MCGs while believing it joined them.

The patch fixes this issue by setting the flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clearing it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup occurs correctly and prevents the ULP from losing the joined MCGs.

The patch also includes proper sign-offs and a review, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and incorrect behavior. It does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a quirk to avoid setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE on certain machines, specifically Dell XPS 13 models. This is done because these machines suffer from non-functional backlight controls if BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE is set.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the i915 driver to apply the quirk. It adds a new quirk flag QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE and a corresponding function quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable() to set the flag.

3. The patch also updates the intel_quirks[] array in intel_display.c to include the Dell XPS13 models and the quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable() function.

4. Finally, the patch modifies the intel_panel_enable_backlight() function in intel_panel.c to check for the QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE flag before setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue with backlight controls on Dell XPS 13 models and provides a quirk to avoid the problem. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug that can cause non-functional backlight controls.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference in the s2mps11_clk_parse_dt() function. If the parent device does not have of_node set, the function currently returns NULL. However, this NULL pointer is later passed to of_clk_add_provider(), which dereferences it in a pr_debug() call.

To fix this issue, the patch changes the return value of s2mps11_clk_parse_dt() to ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) when the parent device does not have of_node set. This ensures that a valid error pointer is returned instead of a NULL pointer.

This fix addresses a potential bug that could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the physical active state on the GIC distributor in a preemptible section, which could lead to setting the active state on a different physical CPU than the one intended. This can cause havoc.

2. The patch proposes a solution by moving the timer flush into a non-preemptible section, as soft timers are no longer descheduled/scheduled in the flush/sync timer functions.

3. The patch has been reviewed by Marc Zyngier and signed-off by Christoffer Dall.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues with CPU synchronization and timer handling. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ibmvnic driver. The bug causes a second call to napi_enable instead of calling napi_disable in the failure path of ibmvnic_open(). This can result in a BUG_ON for any queues that were enabled in the previous call to napi_enable.

Since this bug can potentially lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption, it qualifies as a critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it prevents timeline updates while performing a reset in the DRM/i915 driver.

2. The patch description explains that the list of requests on the timeline can be modified concurrently, leading to potential issues. To prevent this, the patch acquires locks on both the context's timeline and the global timeline.

3. The "Fixes" tag indicates that this patch addresses a specific issue introduced by the commit with the hash "80b204bce8f2," which enabled multiple timelines.

4. The patch is signed-off by Chris Wilson and has been reviewed by Mika Kuoppala.

It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a situation where the mac80211 state machine gets confused due to a failed scheduling of a CSA (Channel Switch Announcement) time event. This confusion can lead to an unstable connection.

The patch disconnects the device if the CSA time event fails to start, which is considered the safest action in this case. The patch also includes proper sign-offs and review acknowledgments.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that can impact the stability and functionality of the iwlwifi driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to the accidental enablement of buck4 ramp delay when ramp delay was set for unsupported bucks (buck[56789] and buck10).
2. The issue was introduced in commit f7b1a8dc1c1c, and this patch fixes it.
3. The patch is signed-off by the author and reviewed by another developer, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.
4. The code changes are focused and address the specific issue without introducing any trivial fixes.
5. The patch includes appropriate error handling and logging in case of failure.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like data corruption or unexpected behavior. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that restricted a virtual function (VF) from configuring any VLAN mode. The reason for reverting this restriction is to allow the same multicast address to be used with any VLAN, saving multicast filters.

However, the patch also removes code that checks for specific MAC operations (QLC_MAC_STAR_ADD and QLC_MAC_STAR_DEL) and returns an error if these operations are detected. Without this check, it is possible for a VF to configure MAC + any VLAN filters, which was previously disallowed.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of allowing MAC + any VLAN filters from a VF. If this change introduces a real and critical bug, such as a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, if this change is considered a trivial fix or does not address a critical issue, then the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

To make a final decision, further analysis and understanding of the specific use case and potential implications of allowing MAC + any VLAN filters from a VF would be necessary.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to disable PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. This is because using the default PM Domain with PM_CLK prevents the registration of the real Clock Domain from DT later.

2. The patch mentions that most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms now use DT-based PM Domains for PM runtime management of the module clocks. The explicit SoC checks are replaced by a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT, simplifying the platform logic.

3. Backwards compatibility with old DTs, mainly for R-Car Gen2, is provided by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

4. The default PM Domain is still needed for backward compatibility with old DTs lacking PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy (non-DT) ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support, and legacy SuperH.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to PM runtime management on multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms with genpd support. It introduces changes to simplify the platform logic and ensure compatibility with old DTs.

Considering that the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The commit being reverted is 23c405912b88.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it should not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch is reverting a previous fix for a memory leak. Memory leaks can be considered critical issues as they can lead to resource exhaustion and system instability over time. However, without further context or information about the specific bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue.

Since the patch is reverting a previous fix, it does not introduce any new changes or fixes. It only removes the kfree() call for par_dev->state. Without knowing the reason for this revert, it is unclear whether it is a trivial change or if it has a significant impact on the stability or security of the system.

Based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further investigation and understanding of the bug being addressed and the reason for the revert would be necessary to make a more informed decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the release of the MMC host after a discard operation. The patch addresses a potential bug where the MMC request data structure may be freed in memory, causing the check of req->cmd_flags & MMC_REQ_SPECIAL_MASK to be dangerous and invalid.

Considering the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release, as it fixes a real and critical bug that can potentially cause data corruption, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug that was introduced by a previous commit, which changed the handling of obj->map_and_fenceable. The bug violates the change introduced in the previous patch.

2. The bug causes incorrect setting of map_and_fenceable to true when the object is not bound to ggtt, which contradicts the intended behavior.

3. The proposed solution is to unbind from the global GTT if the object is currently fenceable but will not be after the tiling change. This ensures that the map_and_fenceable flag is set correctly.

4. The patch includes references to a Bugzilla entry and a specific testcase that verifies the fix.

5. It has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals, including the original author and other contributors.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to tiling changes in the DRM/i915 driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK) for Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a direct call to `mvneta_adjust_link()` in the `mvneta_ioctl()` function. The patch suggests that `mvneta_adjust_link()` should be called indirectly through `phy_mii_ioctl()`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for a firmware issue in the igb i210 NIC. The patch adds an additional zeroing of the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register during the igb_get_phy_id function to address the misconfiguration.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a workaround for a specific hardware/firmware issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about the bug or issue it is intended to fix.

Without further context or explanation, it is difficult to determine the significance of this change. It is possible that removing the interrupt could introduce a bug or cause unexpected behavior. However, without more information, it is not possible to assess the impact of this change.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further clarification or justification is provided.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug related to releasing overlays in the OMAPFB (OMAP Framebuffer) driver.

2. The bug causes a crash if omapfb is unbound and bound again or if the omapfb module is removed and loaded while keeping omapdss (OMAP Display Subsystem) around.

3. The fix involves calling the `unset_manager()` function for all overlays in the `omapfb_free_resources()` function.

4. The `unset_manager()` function is only called if the overlay has a manager associated with it.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a crash. It also does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of the "End of Table" entry in the dmi-sysfs. The patch moves the end-of-table check after it is handled by dmi_table, ensuring that the entry is created in the dmi sysfs as intended.

This bug fix does not seem to be a trivial change, as it addresses a specific issue related to the size of the DMI table. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect DMI table size, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The previous limitation of setting the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to a maximum of 1500 prevented them from taking advantage of jumbo frames and other larger MTU sizes. This limitation can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

2. The patch relaxes the MTU constraints: It allows the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to be set to larger values, up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead. This change enables vxlan devices to utilize larger MTU sizes, improving performance and efficiency.

3. The default MTU remains 1500 for compatibility: The patch ensures that the default MTU value remains unchanged, ensuring compatibility with existing configurations.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on addressing the specific issue of MTU constraints for vxlan devices and does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the preparation of a port STP update in the net/dsa/slave.c file. The issue is that a driver may return -EOPNOTSUPP from the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev. This issue has been reported by Andrew Lunn and the patch has been reviewed and Acked by Andrew Lunn as well.

The patch modifies the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function by introducing the variables `p` and `ds` to access the parent switch and slave private data. It then checks if the switchdev transaction is in the prepare phase and sets `ret` to 0 if the driver supports port STP update, or -EOPNOTSUPP if it does not. Otherwise, it calls the driver's port_stp_update function with the appropriate parameters.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues with STP state updates on certain switches.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW accessing the freed buffers and potentially causing a host crash. 

The patch includes the necessary changes to free the MR in the firmware (FW) before freeing the fast_reg_page_list and other associated resources. It also handles the case where the MR has associated pages and releases them properly.

9. The patch includes changes to the "i915_suspend.c" file to call the "i915_gem_restore_fences" function during state restoration.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a critical bug related to display corruption and reference counting issues, and it provides a comprehensive fix for the issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the pch_uart driver that can lead to a memory access violation. The patch ensures that the DMA channel is allocated when necessary, preventing the issue from occurring.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is removing a call to `plane->destroy` from the `omap_crtc_destroy` function in the `omap_crtc.c` file. The patch states that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework, so the explicit call to `plane->destroy` is no longer needed.

From the description, it appears that the patch is fixing a crash caused by double freeing the plane. This can be considered a real and critical bug that can cause issues such as data corruption or system instability.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, my decision is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "SUNRPC: set per-net PipeFS superblock before notification". From the title, it seems that the patch is related to the SUNRPC subsystem and involves setting the per-net PipeFS superblock before sending a notification.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch adds a line "sn->pipefs_sb = sb;" after the dprintk statement. This line sets the "pipefs_sb" field of the "sn" structure to the "sb" parameter passed to the "rpc_fill_super" function.

3. The patch also adds a line "sn->pipefs_sb = NULL;" before returning from the error handling path. This line sets the "pipefs_sb" field to NULL, indicating that the per-net PipeFS superblock is no longer available.

4. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to address a specific scenario related to the destruction of dentries and the requirement of the per-net PipeFS superblock to be set.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug or address a significant issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. It appears to be more of an optimization or a specific scenario fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c driver.

2. The patch description explains that rep_data is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Tested-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

4. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the wacom_retrieve_report_data() function.

5. In the original code, rep_data[0] is used as an index to retrieve a value from the rep_data array. However, since rep_data is no longer an array, this indexing is incorrect.

6. The patch corrects this issue by passing rep_data directly to wacom_get_report() instead of using rep_data[0] as an index.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug in the code by addressing an incorrect usage of rep_data. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has been reviewed and tested. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch claims to fix an issue where Rx data sometimes drops in non-DMA transfer mode due to an incorrect read complete condition.

2. Code changes: The patch modifies the pch_spi_handler_sub function in the spi-topcliff-pch.c file.

3. Patch analysis:
   a. The patch adds a condition to check if the transfer complete interrupt is set.
   b. If the condition is true, it checks if the tx_index is equal to bpw_len and if the rx_index is equal to tx_index.
   c. If the condition is true, it disables interrupts, sets the transfer_complete and transfer_active flags, wakes up the wait queue, and marks the transfer as completed.
   d. If the condition is false, it logs an error message.

4. Evaluation:
   a. The patch addresses a specific issue related to dropped Rx data in non-DMA transfer mode.
   b. The code changes appear to fix the incorrect read complete condition by adding the necessary checks and actions.
   c. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug reported by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, who confirmed that the bug is benign but still needs fixing.

2. The bug causes an undefined behavior warning due to an incorrect loop iteration in the `rtl8821ae_dm_clear_txpower_tracking_state` function.

3. The loop iterates from 0 to 3, but the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array only has two members, causing the last two iterations to overwrite other variables.

4. Although the bug doesn't seem to affect functionality or the build, it is still a valid issue that should be addressed.

5. The patch changes the size of the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct fix for the bug.

6. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug related to stack overflow when using CONFIG_KASAN with gcc-5. This bug can lead to build errors and potentially cause kernel stack overflow. The patch removes the use of ACCESS_ONCE, which is causing the issue, and has been verified to improve the object code generated by the compiler.

Considering the severity of the bug and the fact that the patch has been tested and verified, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause build errors and potential stack overflow issues, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up. The patch includes a call to `mtk_stop()` to properly stop and free DMA resources and restore the state changed by `mtk_open()` during module removal.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is fixing a specific issue in the ext4 filesystem related to collapsing a range. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

1. The patch is titled "ext4: use truncate_pagecache() in collapse range." This suggests that it aims to improve the behavior of the ext4 filesystem when collapsing a range.

2. The patch description explains that the current code uses `truncate_pagecache_range()` in the collapse range, but it should be using `truncate_pagecache()` instead. The reason for this change is that the page cache needs to be truncated from the specified offset to the end of the file, and `truncate_pagecache()` also removes private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range because the end of the file is being shifted.

3. The patch is signed-off by Lukas Czerner and Theodore Ts'o, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. In the code changes, the line `truncate_pagecache_range(inode, offset, -1);` is replaced with `truncate_pagecache(inode, offset);`. This change aligns with the explanation provided in the patch description.

5. The code change is followed by a comment indicating that it waits for any existing direct I/O (dio) operations to complete and releases the inode's block lock.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue in the ext4 filesystem and improves its behavior when collapsing a range. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves replacing a function call and has been reviewed by relevant individuals.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the USB driver. The bug causes the phy reference counter to decrease below zero, resulting in module insert failures. The patch removes redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop, as these functions are already called in usb_gadget_disconnect and s3c_hsotg_pullup.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM, allowing the HCR to be changed on a per-vCPU basis. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical problems.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freezing groups with stopped tasks in the cgroup freezer subsystem. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it in the original locations where freezing is checked.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix. This indicates that the patch addresses a real and critical bug.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch should be accepted (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues with freezing groups containing stopped tasks.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug causes a splat (kernel warning) during the netns destroy path, indicating a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The bug can lead to data corruption: The warning message mentions the removal of a non-empty directory, indicating a potential data corruption issue.

3. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the lack of removal of net/ip6t_hashlimit/* entries in the hashlimit_proc_net_exit() function, which causes the warning message.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It introduces changes to remove the IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories in the netns destroy path, ensuring proper cleanup.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors: It has been reviewed and signed-off by Sergey Popovich and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

Based on these points, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent potential data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only replaces a call to `snprintf` with `strlcpy` to fix a possible issue with formatting characters in the device name. This change does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue with the DMA debug API not handling multiple mappings of the same buffer correctly. This bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It describes how the debug_dma_mapping_error function was not setting the map_err_type correctly when multiple mappings existed. The patch resolves this by updating the search algorithm to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address.

3. The patch also mentions a secondary side effect, where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type. However, this behavior is considered preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the author and reviewers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses the issue of passing the correct pointer to free_irq(). It states that free_irq() expects the same pointer that was passed to request_irq(), otherwise the IRQ is not freed.

2. The patch includes a Coccinelle script that was used to identify the issue.

3. The patch is signed-off by Lars-Peter Clausen, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch includes Cc (carbon copy) recipients, including Srinidhi Kasagar and Linus Walleij, suggesting that they have been notified and may have reviewed the patch.

5. The patch is also signed-off by Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

6. The patch modifies the file drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c.

7. In the code changes, the line `free_irq(adev->irq[0], ldata->rtc);` is modified to `free_irq(adev->irq[0], ldata);`, passing the correct pointer to free_irq().

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug related to freeing the IRQ correctly and has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals, including the author and maintainers.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "hwmon: (f75375s) Fix bit shifting in f75375_write16". It suggests a fix for a bit shifting issue in the f75375_write16 function of the f75375s hardware monitoring driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the existing line of code in the f75375_write16 function. It changes the bit shifting operation from left shift (<<) to right shift (>>).

3. Analysis:
   The original code performs a left shift operation (value << 8) to extract the high byte of the 16-bit word. However, the patch suggests that the correct operation should be a right shift (value >> 8).

   This indicates that there was an error in the original code, causing incorrect bit shifting and potentially incorrect data manipulation.

4. Impact:
   The incorrect bit shifting in the original code could lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior when writing 16-bit values. This could potentially affect the functionality and reliability of the hardware monitoring driver.

5. Triviality:

2. Bug report: The patch mentions that a BUG_ON condition was triggered in the ioapic_service function. Although the author cannot reproduce it, they provide two possible reasons for the bug.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the assignment of "ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi" in the ioapic_service function. It sets the value to "ret" if "ret" is not negative, otherwise, it sets it to 0.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a bug related to the assignment of "pending_eoi" in the ioapic structure. However, without further details about the bug and its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug, its severity, and the impact it has on the system's stability, security, or functionality.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the firmware code on exynos mcpm systems. It aims to stop relying on the code provided by the bootloader and instead use the kernel's own code for bringing up secondary CPUs.

2. The patch mentions that older bootloaders might have put slightly different code into the location where the firmware expects the kernel's entry point for secondary CPUs. By using the kernel's own code, this potential problem is fixed.

3. The patch includes a simple code jump to the kernel, which is expected to resolve issues caused by older bootloaders and ensure consistent behavior across different hardware.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers and has been tested, indicating that it has undergone review and verification.

5. The changes made in the patch are specific to the exynos-mcpm subsystem and do not appear to have any negative impact on other parts of the kernel.

Based on these points, the patch seems to address a real and critical issue related to firmware code and improves the stability and reliability of the system. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new functions `task_ppid_nr_ns()` and `task_ppid_nr()` to abstract the lookup of the PPID (real_parent's pid_t) of a process, including rcu locking, in the arbitrary and init_pid_ns. These functions provide an alternative to `sys_getppid()`, which is relative to the child process' pid namespace.

This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding new functionality rather than addressing an existing issue.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that caused a regression for users who define both console=ttyS1 and console=ttyS0 on the command line.
2. The regression resulted in kernel log messages being sent to the last mentioned ttyS* instead of the first one, which is not the expected behavior.
3. The original report highlighted that using both console=ttyS1 and console=ttyS0 on the command line makes sense in certain scenarios, particularly when systemd is involved.
4. The patch fix caused a regression related to userspace (systemd) and needs to be reverted.
5. Additionally, it is mentioned that the fix only partially helped, as the messages were still duplicated when the boot console was removed early by late_initcall(printk_late_init).

Since the patch fixes a build error and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the SP (Spatial Reuse Protocol) in the mac80211 subsystem.

2. The issue is described as follows: When a frame is enqueued during the SP and carries the IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP bit, the SP may never be closed (WLAN_STA_SP will never be cleared). This can prevent the opening of new SPs and the response to poll frames from the client.

3. The patch manually clears the WLAN_STA_SP flag if a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU (Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit) session. This ensures that even if the client does not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

4. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Alesya Shapira, and signed-off-by tags from Emmanuel Grumbach and Johannes Berg.

5. The patch also removes an erroneous comment.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the SP in the mac80211 subsystem. It prevents a potential hang or loss of communication with the client. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan process during suspend or hibernation. It explains that if usb-stor-scan is left freezable without actually freezing, the freezer will wait for it to exit, causing threads waiting for scanning to finish to be blocked.

To resolve this, the patch suggests using set_freezable_with_signal() instead of set_freezable() to request a fake signal when freezing. It also replaces wait_event_freezable_timeout() with wait_event_interruptible_timeout() to avoid freezing.

The patch includes proper documentation explaining the rationale behind the changes and is signed-off by multiple developers.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause hangs during suspend or hibernation, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The patch addresses an issue in the uvc driver where the "length" field in the "uvc_request_data" structure is changed from unsigned int to __s32 (signed 32-bit integer). This change allows the field to be used to signal an error when set to a negative value.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The change from unsigned int to __s32 is not a trivial fix as it involves changing the data type, which can have implications on the behavior of the code.

3. The patch has a reported-by tag: The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Fernandez Gonzalo <gfernandez@copreci.es>. This adds credibility to the bug and the need for a fix.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by maintainers: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com> and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logical omission in the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc function in the USB DWC2 host driver. The patch addresses memory manipulation issues and ensures that Host DDMA bulk transfers work correctly.

The patch also fixes a bug introduced by a previous patch that caused the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc function to return a failure status even when the descriptor was processed normally. This incorrect behavior caused the processing of remaining descriptors to be prematurely stopped, which is not correct for QTDs containing more than one descriptor.

The patch includes changes to properly handle the failure status and the completion of non-isochronous transactions in Host DDMA mode. It ensures that the software goes out of both loops (qh->qtd, qtd->descs) and reports the failure when necessary.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect behavior in the USB DWC2 host driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix the REGSET_VX_LOW vector register ELF notes in the s390/kdump code. Currently, the upper halves of the first sixteen 128-bit vector registers are being copied instead of the lower halves. The patch intends to correct this by copying the lower halves correctly.

2. Fixes:
   The patch mentions that it fixes a specific commit (a62bc0739253) that added support for vector extension in s390/kdump.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes involve modifying the memcpy call in the nt_s390_vx_low function. Instead of copying the entire vector register, it now copies only the lower 64-bit half of the vector register.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch seems to fix a specific bug related to copying the incorrect data in the REGSET_VX_LOW ELF notes. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the memcpy call to correctly copy the lower halves of the vector registers.

   However, without further context or knowledge about the s390/kdump code and the impact of the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or falls under the "oh, that's not good" category. Additionally, the patch does not mention any specific build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues being addressed.

   Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, a more thorough analysis by a kernel maintainer or expert in the s390/kdump code would be necessary to make a final decision.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: It addresses a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race condition in the probe function of the legousbtower driver.

2. The patch restructures the probe function to only register the interface after successfully reading the board's firmware ID. This ensures that the interface is registered correctly and avoids potential issues.

3. The patch also fixes a potential security vulnerability: If the 0 address is mappable on the machine, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a local privilege escalation (LPE) exploit via a write-what-where condition. However, it is important to note that this vulnerability requires a forged USB device and local program execution, making it less likely to be exploited.

4. The bug has existed since 2003, indicating that it is a long-standing issue that needs to be addressed.

5. The patch has been tested by emulated device and has been reported and tested by James Patrick-Evans.

6. The patch has been signed-off by James Patrick-Evans and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Considering the critical bug fix, the potential security vulnerability, and the testing/validation done, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the "struct workqueue_struct *rq_wq" member from the "struct rbd_device" structure. This member was previously used to store a per-device workqueue.
   - This change suggests that using a separate workqueue for each device is not necessary and doesn't make much sense.
   - Removing this member simplifies the code and reduces unnecessary overhead.

2. The patch introduces a new "struct workqueue_struct *rbd_wq" variable.
   - This new workqueue will be used as a single workqueue for all devices.
   - The work items will be limited by the number of rbd devices.

3. The patch modifies the "rbd_request_fn" function to use the new "rbd_wq" workqueue instead of the per-device workqueue.
   - This change ensures that all devices share the same workqueue for processing requests.

4. The patch removes the allocation and destruction of the per-device workqueue in the "rbd_dev_device_setup" and "rbd_dev_device_release" functions.
   - Since the per-device workqueue is no longer used, it is no longer necessary to allocate and destroy it.

5. The patch introduces the allocation of the new "rbd_wq" workqueue in the "rbd_init" function and its destruction in the "rbd_exit" function.
   - This ensures that the new workqueue is properly initialized and cleaned up during module initialization and exit.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch improves the code by simplifying it and reducing unnecessary overhead.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to passing arbitrary data to the sideband interface in the DRM driver for Intel DSI panels. The change restricts the data passed to the sideband interface to only the least significant bit (bitwise AND with 1).

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, it addresses a potential issue with passing arbitrary data to the sideband interface, which could have unintended consequences.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - It does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the change is not trivial as it modifies the behavior of the code by restricting the data passed to the sideband interface.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a race condition between the connected_handler and the connection teardown flow in the iser-target driver.

2. The patch takes the isert_conn pointer from cm_id->qp->qp_context to ensure that the cm_id context is always the network portal. This makes the cm_id event check (connection or network portal) more reliable.

3. To avoid a NULL dereference in cma_id->qp->qp_context, the patch destroys the qp after destroying the cm_id, making the dereference safe. This is necessary because session establishment/teardown sequences can happen in parallel, and the connected_handler might race with the connection teardown flow.

4. The patch also protects the decrement of isert_conn->conn_device->active_qps within the error patch during QP creation failure and the normal teardown path in isert_connect_release().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to a race condition and ensures the reliability of the cm_id event check. It also includes necessary protections to avoid NULL dereferences and handle error scenarios correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for enabling the hotplug irq only if needed in the drm/i915 driver. The patch aims to avoid constant wakeups caused by noisy irq lines when the irq is not required. It also includes a fix for disabling sdvo hotplug on i945g/gm.

5. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch involve modifying the functions `rtl_hw_jumbo_enable` and `rtl_hw_jumbo_disable`. The changes involve acquiring and releasing a lock (`Cfg9346`) before and after performing certain operations.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to corrupted IP fragments when using a large MTU size. The patch also includes necessary code changes to fix the issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data sign in the iio: st_pressure driver. The patch changes the sign of the pressure and temperature data from unsigned ('u') to signed ('s') in multiple channel specifications for different pressure sensors.

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect data interpretation, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The Fixes tags indicate that this patch resolves issues introduced by previous patches, further supporting its importance for stability and functionality.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch forces the function `kernel_init_freeable()` to be marked as `noinline` to reduce code bloat. Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it fixes an incorrect condition in determining the last logical address (last_la) used for the initial attempt at claiming a logical address.

2. The patch modifies the code in the cec_config_thread_func() function in the cec-adap.c file.

3. In the original code, the condition !(last_la & type2mask[type]) is used to check if the last_la is valid for the given type. However, this condition is incorrect because last_la is not converted to a mask before the AND operation.

4. The patch modifies the condition to !((1 << last_la) & type2mask[type]) to correctly convert last_la to a mask and perform the AND operation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug in the code that could lead to incorrect logical address determination. This bug does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the correct functioning of the logical address determination.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug and can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question removes a redundant error check on the return code of `copy_to_user` function. The patch is fixing a logical dead code issue detected by CoverityScan and references a previous fix for the misuse of the return value of `copy_to_user`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix an unchecked dereference of the `arch_pwrdm` variable in the `arch/arm/mach-omap2/powerdomain.c` file. This issue was reported by Dan Carpenter and has been acknowledged by Nishanth Menon.

The patch checks if `arch_pwrdm` is not null and if `arch_pwrdm->pwrdm_wait_transition` is not null before calling `arch_pwrdm->pwrdm_wait_transition(pwrdm)`. This change ensures that the dereference is safe and avoids potential issues.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug and addresses a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new revision of Apple's wired aluminum keyboard. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial addition of USB device IDs for the new revision of the keyboard.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error. The patch addresses the issue of BUG_ON(nd->inode != parent->d_inode) reported by Dave Jones and reproduced with mkdir /proc/self/ns/uts/a. 

The patch updates the proc_ns_follow_link function to use nd_jump_link instead of manually updating nd.path.dentry. This change is necessary due to a VFS change that requires the use of nd_jump_link. 

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a mutex lock definition for `trace_types_lock` in `trace_events.c`. This lock is used to protect the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list.
   - This change ensures that the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list is accessed safely and avoids potential race conditions.
   - This is a necessary fix to prevent potential issues with accessing the list without proper synchronization.

2. The patch adds an external declaration for `trace_types_lock` in `trace.h`.
   - This ensures that the `trace_types_lock` variable is accessible from other files that include `trace.h`.
   - This is a necessary change to allow proper locking and unlocking of `trace_types_lock` in other functions.

3. The patch adds mutex locking and unlocking around the access to `ftrace_trace_arrays` in the `subsystem_open` function.
   - This change ensures that the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list is accessed safely and avoids potential race conditions.
   - This is a necessary fix to prevent potential issues with accessing the list without proper synchronization.

4. The patch adds mutex locking and unlocking around the access to `event_mutex` and `trace_types_lock` in the `trace_add_event_call` function.
   - This change ensures that the `event_mutex` and `trace_types_lock` are acquired and released properly when adding an event call.
   - This is a necessary fix to prevent potential issues with concurrent access to the event calls.

5. The patch adds mutex locking and unlocking around the access to `event_mutex` and `trace_types_lock` in the `trace_remove_event_call` function.
   - This change ensures that the `event_mutex` and `trace_types_lock` are acquired and released properly when removing an event call.
   - This is a necessary fix to prevent potential issues with concurrent access to the event calls.

6. The patch adds mutex locking and unlocking around the access to `event_mutex` and `trace_types_lock` in the `trace_module_notify` function.
   - This change ensures that the `event_mutex` and `trace_types_lock` are acquired and released properly when handling module notifications.
   - This is a necessary fix to prevent potential issues with concurrent access to the module notifications.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that this patch fixes potential race conditions and ensures proper synchronization when accessing the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list and handling event calls and module notifications. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a printk statement and assigns the value of "op.value" to the "err" variable. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of strncpy to strscpy in the orangefs_inode_getattr function in the orangefs-utils.c file.

2. The patch addresses a potential issue where a rogue client-core could send a symlink target that is not NUL terminated, which could result in corrupt data.

3. The patch uses strscpy instead of strncpy to copy the link target, which has a size limit defined by ORANGEFS_NAME_MAX.

4. If the strscpy function returns -E2BIG, indicating that the link target exceeds the size limit, the patch sets the return value to -EIO and jumps to the "out" label.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue that could lead to data corruption and ensures that the link target is properly copied within the defined size limit.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled for the ext4 filesystem. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug or issue, but rather adds a feature to enable journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled, it does not meet the criteria for fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a panic due to an inability to handle a kernel paging request. The bug is related to the qlcnic driver and specifically the qlcnic_release_tx_buffers function.

The patch modifies the for loop in the function, changing the loop counter initialization from 0 to 1. This change ensures that the Tx frag being released is properly mapped before freeing it, preventing the panic.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a system crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch introduces changes to the DIM decision mechanism in order to improve bandwidth, packet rate, and gain. While these improvements are beneficial, they do not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a build error in the ARM architecture for the imx6q_sabrelite board. The error occurs when building with a modular phylib, resulting in an undeclared identifier error for 'ksz9021rn_phy_fixup'. 

This issue can cause a build error, which is a real and critical bug. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to fix this issue and ensure proper functionality of the imx6q_sabrelite board.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The HIH6130/1 sensor requires zero-length data transfers to start a measurement, but some I2C bus drivers do not allow this. The patch proposes a workaround by writing a zero dummy byte, which has been verified to work with the OMAP I2C bus driver on a BeagleBone board.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It introduces a new variable, "write_length," to handle the length of the I2C measurement request.

3. The patch does not introduce any security issues or data corruption risks.

4. The patch does not cause build errors, oops, hangs, or any other critical issues.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the probe function in the Bluetooth driver. The current implementation returns the value returned by hci_register_dev(), which is the HCI index. However, this can cause issues on systems where the btwilink device has an ID larger than 0.

The proposed fix changes the return value of the probe function to 0 on success. This ensures consistent behavior across systems and avoids potential problems.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue that could lead to problems on certain systems, but it does not fall into the category of a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for emac on dm816x, which indicates that it is addressing a specific hardware compatibility issue.

2. The patch includes Cc and Signed-off-by fields, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The patch modifies the "compatible" property in the device tree bindings for davinci_emac. It adds support for the "ti,dm816-emac" compatible string, indicating that it is extending the compatibility of the driver to include dm816x.

4. The patch also adds a new entry in the "davinci_emac_of_match" array, associating the "ti,dm816-emac" compatible string with the "dm816_emac_data" structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding support for a new hardware platform (dm816x) to the davinci_emac driver. This can be considered a real and critical bug fix as it enables the driver to work correctly on dm816x devices.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "s390/kdump: Clear subchannel ID to signal non-CCW/SCSI IPL". 

The patch description explains that there are use cases where an intermediate boot kernel uses kexec to boot the final production kernel. In this scenario, the original boot information should be provided to the production kernel. Therefore, clearing the boot information during kexec should not be done.

Looking at the code changes, the lines that clear the subchannel ID and number have been removed. These lines were previously used to signal the new kernel that no CCW or SCSI IPL has been done during kexec and kdump.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is reverting a change that is necessary for specific use cases involving kexec and kdump. Without further context or information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

In order to make a decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that the original commit was addressing and the impact it had on the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be addressing a specific erratum related to the P2020/P2010 processors. The erratum, known as eTSEC 20, causes excess delays when transmitting large frames with TOE (TCP/IP hardware accelerations) enabled. This issue was fixed in Revision 2.0 of the processors.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause delays in transmitting large frames with TOE enabled. It is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a fairness problem when net.sctp.sndbuf_policy=0 (accounting per socket) and one-to-many sockets are in use. In this scenario, the reclaimed write space from sctp_wfree() is only handed back to the association that is woken up again via __sctp_write_space(), while the remaining associations are not woken up.

The patch introduces a new function called sctp_wake_up_waiters() that traverses the socket association list and wakes up all related associations to a socket in a fair manner. This ensures that no association is preferred over another, and all receivers will receive messages from the server, even under high load.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or a "not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a race condition between URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer, potentially leading to an oops in certain scenarios.

The patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue() function to remove TDs from the TD lists and canceled TD lists before giving back the URB. It also includes additional changes in various functions to ensure proper removal of TDs from the lists.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause an oops and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture in the KVM module. The patch addresses a potential problem with accessing guest code during MMIO load completion, which could lead to reading the branch instruction from host user memory instead. 

The patch calculates the resume PC in advance and saves it in the vcpu->arch.io_pc field. It then restores this value on MMIO completion. Additionally, the patch removes the no longer needed vcpu->arch.pending_load_cause field.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or security issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to interrupt timeout handling in the net/mvmdio driver. The patch ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, which guarantees that wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to timeouts and incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for handling power-gating flags properly in the AMDGPU driver for VCE (Video Codec Engine). 

The patch checks if the power-gating support for VCE is enabled before attempting to start or stop the VCE block. If power-gating support is disabled, the function returns without performing any actions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for handling power-gating flags correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "sunvnet: Initialize network_header and transport_header in vnet_rx_one()". It suggests initializing network_header and transport_header in the skb created in vnet_rx_one().

2. The patch is signed-off by Sowmini Varadhan <sowmini.varadhan@oracle.com> and David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

3. The patch modifies the vnet_rx_one() function in the sunvnet.c file.

4. In the vnet_rx_one() function, if the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag is set and skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE, the patch adds additional checks to ensure that the skb protocol is ETH_P_IP. If the protocol is ETH_P_IP, it initializes the transport_header and computes the full checksum using vnet_fullcsum().

5. The patch also initializes the network_header using skb_reset_network_header().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to checksum computation for IPv4 packets in the sunvnet driver. It ensures that the necessary headers are properly initialized before computing the checksum. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload). The bug occurs when the buffer is within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of a 4G boundary. The patch introduces a workaround to detect and handle this condition.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific hardware issue that can lead to data corruption, it qualifies as a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply moves the call to `omap_hsmmc_context_save()` to a different location within the `omap_hsmmc_probe()` function. This change does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a double fetch bug in the ioctl function of the cros_ec_dev driver. This bug could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" change between the two copy_from_user() calls.

2. The patch improves security: By verifying that the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" have not changed, the patch prevents potential buffer overflows, which can be a security vulnerability.

3. The patch fixes a potential data corruption issue: The patch ensures that the correct value of "s_cmd->insize" is used, even if cros_ec_cmd_xfer() sets it to a lower value. This prevents copying too much data to the user, avoiding potential data corruption.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reviewed by Kees Cook and tested by Gwendal Grignou, which adds confidence in its correctness and effectiveness.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a real and critical bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a merge error and initializes a missing variable. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to an information leak in AUDIT_GET requests. The patch initializes the "mask" member of the "status_set" structure to zero, which prevents the leakage of 4 bytes of kernel stack.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information leakage, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in block/blk-ioc.c.
2. The reverse double lock dancing in ioc_release_fn() is replaced with a trylock on the queue_lock. If the trylock fails, it backs out from the ioc lock and releases the queue lock.
3. The patch removes the need for tracking the last_q variable and simplifies the code by directly using the icq->q variable.
4. The ioc_exit_icq() function is called to exit the icq.
5. The patch unlocks the queue lock and restores the ioc lock.
6. Finally, the ioc_release_fn() function frees the memory allocated for the io_context structure.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to simplify the code and improve the locking mechanism in ioc_release_fn(). However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix that simplifies the code without addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to event processing delay and potential data halt and disconnection on the AP interface. This can be considered a real and critical bug that affects the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel.

The patch modifies multiple files related to different VIF types (STA, ADHOC, MESH) and their handling after a scan is completed. It removes the requeuing of work items for IBSS and Mesh VIF types, and instead, it requeues work for all VIF types.

The change seems reasonable and necessary to ensure that event processing is not delayed or missed for any VIF type after a scan is completed. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of btrfs_page_exists_in_range uses the incorrect type for page indices, which can lead to unexpected failures and incorrect results.

2. The bug can cause issues in various scenarios, including hole punching and direct locking, where it is crucial to ensure that there are no pages in the specified range.

3. The bug can result in false negatives, where the function incorrectly returns false even though there is at least one page in the range.

4. The bug has specific constraints for practical occurrence, including large file size, crossing the 16TiB boundary, and matching internal state of file pages and pending operations.

5. The worst consequence of the bug seems to be stale data reads, which can be problematic but may not directly lead to build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

Considering these points, while the bug may not directly cause the most severe issues, it does impact critical functionality and can lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, it is advisable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and correctness of the btrfs filesystem.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix an issue in the KVM virtual interrupt controller (vgic) code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses a problem where the active state of an interrupt is checked incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior when external inputs need to access the state of a virtual interrupt.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real bug related to memory leaks in the HID multitouch driver. The function `mt_free_input_name()` was not being called during the `.remove()` operation, leading to a memory leak. The patch fixes this issue by restoring the original name before freeing it to avoid accessing an already freed pointer.

The bug fix is critical as it prevents a memory leak, which can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability. It does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
