Therefore, it is more of a stability fix rather than a security fix.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it replaces the `strncpy()` function with `strlcpy()`. The `strncpy()` function can lead to issues if it does not end with a null byte when the maximum length is reached, which can cause buffer overflows, a common security vulnerability. On the other hand, `strlcpy()` ensures that the result is null-terminated. It's a common practice to replace `strncpy()` with `strlcpy()` in security patches to prevent such vulnerabilities.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential null pointer dereference issue in the media driver. While null pointer dereference can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this context, it is more about stability and preventing a system crash (OOPS - Out of memory Or Protection fault System crash) rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability. 

The patch adds a check to see if the function `videobuf_dvb_get_frontend` returns NULL. If it does, it returns an error code (-EINVAL), preventing the null pointer from being used in subsequent code.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a failure handling in the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) core of the Linux kernel. Specifically, it corrects the check for dma_map_sg() failures. This is more of a reliability and correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. It doesn't seem to address any specific security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, privilege escalations, or information leaks. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP).

The patch is designed to avoid a race condition between fopen(3) and fchmod(2). This race condition could potentially allow an attacker to open an old file with incorrect permissions before the secret is written into it. The patch uses umask(2), unlink(2), and fopen(3) to prevent this from happening. This ensures that a new file with the correct permissions is created. The removal of "fattr" from pledge also indicates a security improvement. Therefore, this patch is intended to improve the security of the system, making it a security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is designed to prevent data corruption that could occur when tracer flags are modified concurrently by different tasks. It does this by ensuring that the modification of tracer flags is protected by the trace_types_lock mutex. 

While this patch does improve the robustness of the system, it does not directly address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is not classified as a security patch.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is addressing a potential security vulnerability where a negative chunk size could lead to out-of-bounds memory access. This could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. The patch adds a check for negative chunk sizes and returns an error if the chunk size is negative, thus preventing the potential security issue.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a bug where the CHECK TABLE function in InnoDB does not mark an index as corrupted when it finds the wrong number of entries. The patch ensures that the index is marked as corrupted so it is not used again. This is a functional issue, not a security issue. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a compiler warning related to the potential use of an uninitialized variable 'bs.frame' in the function 'zoran_dqbuf'. The patch initializes 'bs.frame' to 0 to suppress the compiler warning. This is a code quality improvement and does not directly address a security vulnerability.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The reason is that it addresses a memory management issue, specifically a bad memory free in the sslUpgrade function. Incorrect memory management can lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or memory leaks, which can be exploited by attackers. Therefore, this patch is likely intended to fix a security issue.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the timeout functionality in the cryptsetup utility. The patch fixes an issue where the timeout was set to infinity when it should have been 0. This is more of a functionality fix rather than a security fix. There are no changes made that directly address any security vulnerabilities or enhance the security of the system.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential null pointer dereference issue in the ALSA USB driver. While null pointer dereference can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this context, it appears to be more about preventing a potential system crash (a quality or reliability issue) rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability. 

The patch adds a check for the return value of kmalloc() to ensure it's not NULL before proceeding, which is a common way to prevent null pointer dereference issues. If kmalloc() fails and returns NULL, the function will now return an error, preventing the potential null pointer dereference. 

However, there's no indication in the commit message or the patch itself that this is intended to fix a security vulnerability, so it's classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is addressing a memory management issue in the ath5k wireless driver.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is related to the network driver r8152. It introduces a check for an empty transmission aggregation list before acquiring a spin lock. This is an optimization to avoid unnecessary spin lock acquisitions, which can improve performance but does not directly address a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it addresses a potential vulnerability where the system could use uninitialized data if the "copy_from_user()" function fails or if the "count" is too small. Using uninitialized data can lead to undefined behavior, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. Therefore, this patch is intended to enhance the security of the system by preventing such a scenario.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). The commit message clearly states "avoid using tmpnam() for security reasons." The tmpnam() function can potentially create vulnerabilities as it generates a temporary file name that can be guessed or hijacked by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the file system. The patch replaces the use of tmpnam() with a safer method, thus enhancing the security of the system.
security || This patch is (B) a non-security patch (NSP).

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is about freeing a temporary variable in the target-ppc (PowerPC) code of the QEMU emulator. It doesn't seem to address any specific security vulnerability, but rather it's more about resource management and preventing memory leaks.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a return value check in the create_irq() function. It's adjusting the condition to handle both the cases when ia64 returns a negative error code when allocation fails and when x86 returns 0. This is a bug fix, but it doesn't appear to be addressing a specific security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential issue with the qcow2_grow_l1_table() function in the qcow2-cluster.c file. The problem is related to the possibility of an overflow during the calculation of new_l1_size due to the difference in data types of new_l1_size and min_size. The patch introduces a sanity check on min_size to prevent this overflow. 

While this patch does fix a potential issue that could cause incorrect behavior, it does not appear to address a vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes. Therefore, it is not classified as a security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a potential null pointer dereference issue in the USB gadget subsystem of the Linux kernel.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a race condition in the smd channel allocation in the msm/qsd subsystem. A race condition is a type of bug that can occur in concurrent systems, where the outcome of the system is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.

However, it's important to note that while race conditions can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, not all race conditions are security issues. In this case, the patch does not indicate that the race condition leads to a security vulnerability. Instead, it seems to be more about ensuring the system behaves correctly under all conditions. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is primarily addressing a specific corner case in the i40e network driver where the NVM update wait flag could be cleared without receiving an update_done message. This is more of a reliability and correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The patch also updates the copyright year in file headers, which is a routine maintenance task and not related to security.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the ehv_pic_init function of the ehv_pic.c file in the arch/powerpc/sysdev directory. The developer added a kfree(ehv_pic) call to free the memory allocated to ehv_pic if ehv_pic->irqhost is NULL. This is a memory management fix, not a security fix. Security patches typically involve fixing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious users, such as buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or information disclosure vulnerabilities.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a bug in the error handling code of the mwl8k_probe function. If the ieee80211_register_hw() function fails, the code previously jumped to a label that would free an IRQ. However, at this point in the code, the IRQ has not been requested yet, so there is nothing to free. The patch corrects this by making the code jump to a different label that does not attempt to free the IRQ. This is a bug fix, but it does not appear to address a security vulnerability.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to memory allocation and management, specifically setting an error message variable to NULL after it's no longer needed. While these changes can help prevent memory leaks and improve the stability of the software, they do not directly address any security vulnerabilities or add any security features. Therefore, it's not classified as a security patch.
security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message indicates that it is a bug fix, but it does not specify that it is related to security.

security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it adds sanity checks to the code in the pdf.c file of the libclamav library. These checks seem to be aimed at preventing potential security issues that could occur if the file descriptor 'fd' does not read the expected number of bytes (sb.st_size). If the read operation does not return the expected number of bytes, the code now closes the file descriptor, unlinks the new object's path, frees the memory allocated to the new object's path and the 'begin' variable, and returns NULL. 

This kind of patch is typically used to prevent security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or unexpected behavior due to incorrect file sizes.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a crash issue in the mthca_write_mtt() function for certain hardware configurations. It is not addressing any security vulnerabilities or adding any security features, but rather fixing a functional bug in the system. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is fixing an overflow condition in the function pool_find_page() in the dmapool module. The overflow condition is not related to a security vulnerability but rather a functional issue that could cause the system to behave incorrectly under certain conditions. The patch modifies the calculation to prevent the overflow, improving the reliability of the system.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the talitos_alg_alloc() function of the crypto module. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to cause a security breach, such as unauthorized access or data leakage. In this case, there is no indication that the memory leak could lead to such a security vulnerability. Therefore, this patch is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a segmentation fault (segfault) issue that occurs on startup for the update command. Segmentation faults are typically bugs related to memory management, but they are not necessarily security vulnerabilities. In this case, the patch ensures that a NULL check is performed before copying the 'ce_tag'. This is more of a stability improvement rather than a security fix.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The commit message "fix two uaf in anal.c" suggests that the patch is intended to fix two Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the file anal.c. UAF vulnerabilities are a type of security issue where a piece of memory is used after it has been freed, which can lead to various types of malicious exploits. 

In the patch, we can see that additional checks are added to ensure that the 'input' is not only non-null but also points to a valid memory location before it is used. Also, there is a check added to ensure that 'core->anal->fcns' is not equal to 'fcns' before freeing 'fcns'. These changes are likely made to prevent UAF vulnerabilities.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a warning in the scheduling system of the kernel, specifically in the sched_fork() function. It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather improving the system's performance and stability by silencing a warning. The author suggests a better solution would be to move the cgroup_fork() function, but for now, they're just silencing the warning. 

In general, security patches would fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious users, while non-security patches improve the system's functionality, performance, or stability without necessarily addressing a security threat.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a memory leak issue in the btrfs DIO code.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a memory leak issue in the i40e_dbg_command_write() function. When the copy_from_user() function fails, 'cmd_buf' is not freed, leading to a memory leak. This is a bug fix related to resource management, not a security vulnerability patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is designed to fix a potential memory leak in the nfs4_setlease function. Memory leaks are generally considered to be a quality or reliability issue rather than a security issue, as they don't typically allow an attacker to compromise the system. They can lead to system instability or crashes if the system runs out of memory, but they don't usually lead to breaches of confidentiality, integrity, or availability, which are the three main aspects of information security. 

Therefore, this patch is more about improving the reliability and stability of the system rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug that causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, which is a type of crash. The patch does not appear to address any security vulnerabilities, but rather it seems to be aimed at improving the stability of the system by preventing this type of crash.

security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a minor warning identified by Coverity, a static code analysis tool. The warning is related to integer handling issues (NEGATIVE_RETURNS). The patch adds a condition to check if the 'list' variable is less than 0 or greater than or equal to DETECT_SM_LIST_MAX, and if so, it returns without executing the rest of the function. This is a typical example of a patch that improves code robustness and prevents potential bugs, but it does not directly address a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is modifying the way the function `snprintf` is used in the code. The `(void)` cast before `snprintf` is used to explicitly ignore the result of the function. This is typically done when the programmer knows that a function returns a value that is not needed.

In this case, the return value of `snprintf` (which is the number of characters that would have been written if the buffer was large enough) is not being used, so it is being explicitly ignored with the `(void)` cast. This is more of a code quality or style change than a security fix. 

A security patch would typically involve changes that fix vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, privilege escalations, or other types of exploitable bugs. This patch does not appear to be addressing any such issues.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a race condition in the setup method of the spi-mxs driver. It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather a functional bug that could lead to data corruption when transfers are in progress. The patch removes the call to mxs_spi_setup_transfer() in the setup method, which was causing the issue. This is a typical example of a non-security related bug fix.
security || This patch is (B) a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug (#21969) related to the handling of hot-keys in the game. It is designed to prevent the preferences file from being polluted with null commands. This is a functionality improvement and bug fix, not a security-related change.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The change is adding a null check before writing a result and setting it to null. This is more likely a bug fix or a stability improvement rather than a security fix. A security patch would typically address vulnerabilities that could be exploited maliciously, such as buffer overflows, privilege escalations, or information leaks.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a compiler warning about the frame size being larger than 1024 bytes. It does this by changing the allocation of certain variables from being local (and thus on the stack) to being dynamically allocated on the heap using kmalloc. This is a performance and stability improvement, not a security fix.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The author of the patch mentions that the previous behavior could have been a security problem as it could be used to touch an arbitrary file. The patch modifies the code to delay the setting of utime on cachedir until it is confirmed to be safe, thus mitigating the potential security risk.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory management issue in the tracing system of the kernel. It's fixing a bug where the pointer to a freed buffer isn't reset, which could lead to corruption in the allocation system if the function is called more than once. While this could potentially lead to crashes or other system instability, it doesn't directly relate to the security of the system, hence it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a regression issue in the opj_write_tile() function when numresolutions=1. It's modifying the condition to check the pointer value only if l_data_size != 0. This is a functional issue and not related to security vulnerabilities or threats. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message indicates that it's a fix for an issue (#38525), but it doesn't mention anything about security vulnerabilities. The change itself is also not directly related to security - it's changing the directory to root after a chroot operation. This is more of a functionality or stability fix rather than a security fix.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a NULL pointer dereference bug in the drm/i915 driver. This is a type of bug that can cause a system crash, but it's not related to security. It's more about system stability. The patch adds a check to ensure the pointer is not NULL before it's used, which prevents the system crash.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is related to the network driver 'davinci_emac' for the Texas Instruments DaVinci SoC. The change frees a clock after checking its frequency. This is a resource management improvement, not a security fix. There are no security vulnerabilities being addressed, no mention of security issues, and the changes do not involve any security features or functions.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the software. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. In this case, there is no indication that the memory leak could be exploited in such a way, so it is considered a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message indicates that it's fixing a bug related to uninitialized values, which is typically a quality or reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The code changes are also consistent with this interpretation, as they seem to be initializing some values that were previously not initialized in certain cases.
security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a null pointer dereference issue in the vhost-net driver. While null pointer dereference issues can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, the author's comments do not indicate that this was a security-related fix. Instead, it seems to be a general bug fix to improve the stability and reliability of the system. Therefore, without additional context indicating a security concern, this patch should be classified as a non-security patch (NSP).
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a null pointer dereference issue, which is a type of bug that can cause a system crash but it's not typically associated with security vulnerabilities. The patch ensures that if the system fails to allocate an indirect buffer (ib), it will return an error instead of trying to use the ib, thus preventing a potential system crash. 

However, it's important to note that while null pointer dereference issues can sometimes be exploited for malicious purposes, in this context, there's no indication that this bug is being exploited in such a way, or that the patch is intended to address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it's classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The reason is that it includes a change to zero out the read buffer after copying data to the user. This is a common security practice to prevent sensitive data from lingering in memory and potentially being accessed by unauthorized users or processes. The patch is applied to a file in the SSL library, which is often a target for security attacks. Therefore, this patch is likely intended to improve the security of the system.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the clk: versatile module of the Linux kernel. If the function of_clk_parent_fill() fails, the memory allocated to sp810 is not freed, causing a memory leak. This patch adds a line of code to free that memory if the function fails, thus fixing the memory leak. 

While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues or crashes if they are severe and persistent enough, they are not typically considered security issues unless they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or reveal sensitive information. In this case, there is no indication that the memory leak could be exploited in such a way, so it is not a security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential null pointer dereference issue. The code is modified to check if the malloc function call successfully allocated memory before proceeding. If the malloc function fails and returns NULL, the code will now return NULL instead of trying to dereference the null pointer, which would cause a crash. 

While this is an important fix to improve the stability of the software, it does not directly address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the handling of temporary dialogues in the pua module. Specifically, it releases a lock when a temporary dialog is not found. This seems to be more related to improving the robustness and reliability of the software rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory management issue in the IOMMU/AMD driver where a domain ID is not being freed when a domain of struct dma_ops_domain is freed. This is more of a resource management or bug fix rather than a security vulnerability fix. It's important to note that while memory leaks can potentially lead to security issues, this patch does not directly address a known security vulnerability.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing an issue with uninitialized variables in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. The author of the patch has not indicated that this is a security vulnerability, and the changes made in the patch do not appear to be addressing a security issue. Instead, it seems to be a bug fix to ensure that the range variable is properly initialized to prevent potential issues in the program's execution.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a memory leak in the vmbus_process_offer() function. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues or crashes, they are not typically considered security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. In this case, there is no indication that the memory leak could be exploited in such a way, so it is considered a non-security patch.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a potential security vulnerability where a malicious user could exploit the getsockopt function in the DCCP protocol. The patch fixes the issue by checking for enough space to put the int and also checks for negative len values. This is a security-related change as it prevents potential misuse or exploitation of the system.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the mysql_real_connect() function. When the SSL connection fails, the scramble_buffer is not freed, leading to a memory leak. This is a bug fix related to resource management, not a security vulnerability fix. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is fixing a memory leak in the Btrfs file system. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. In this case, there's no indication that the memory leak could be exploited in such a way, so it's more likely to be a reliability/quality improvement rather than a security fix.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are aimed at improving the functionality of the system by adding a check to prevent a crash scenario. It does not seem to address any specific security vulnerabilities or threats. Instead, it focuses on the stability and reliability of the system.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The change is made to avoid an infinite loop if pixel format conversion does not exist. This seems to be more of a functionality or performance improvement rather than a security fix. It doesn't address any specific security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, code injections, or privilege escalations.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The change is related to fixing an infinite analysis issue in the RISC-V architecture, which seems to be more of a functionality or performance issue rather than a security vulnerability. The patch modifies a condition to check if a word equals UT64_MAX instead of UT32_MAX, which is likely to prevent the infinite loop. This is more about improving the software's robustness or performance, not about fixing a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is fixing a double free vulnerability. Double free vulnerabilities can lead to a variety of security issues, including potential arbitrary code execution, which is a serious security risk. The patch removes the problematic 'free(comment_header);' line, which was causing the double free.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is addressing a potential segmentation fault (segv) that could occur if a DNS error leaves a pointer NULL when the system tries to close a stdio stream in an MTA session. Segmentation faults are a type of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong to you." It's a mechanism that prevents you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segmentation fault, you know you are doing something wrong with memory - such as accessing a variable that has already been freed or writing to a read-only portion of memory. The fact that this patch is preventing such a situation makes it a security patch.
security || This patch is (B) a non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a user interface issue where autoscrolling can cause an unintended jump to the last page of a document. The fix involves a condition check to prevent a negative value from being assigned to "scroll_info.last_y". This is a functional issue, not a security issue. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a double free error in the GPRS outbound packet error path. Double free errors are a type of software bug that can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or other problems, but they are not typically associated with security vulnerabilities. 

In this case, the patch removes a line of code that was causing a packet (skb) to be freed twice. This is a bug fix, but not a security fix. 

Therefore, this patch is a non-security patch (NSP).
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is addressing a potential issue where a function (`bdrv_check()`) is called twice under certain conditions, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the driver (`bs->drv`) is not set. This is more of a stability or reliability fix rather than a security fix. It's not addressing any known vulnerabilities or security flaws, but rather it's preventing a potential crash or undefined behavior.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a crash that occurs when the function acm_tty_flush_chars() is called with no buffer to flush. The fix is simply to do nothing if there is no buffer. This seems to be more of a stability or reliability fix rather than a security fix. There is no mention of any security vulnerabilities being addressed, nor does the patch appear to include any security-related code changes.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a regression in the spc_emulate_inquiry() function where the local scope bounce buffer was no longer getting its memory zeroed. This was causing problems with SCSI initiators that depend upon areas of INQUIRY EVPD=0x83 payload having been zeroed. The patch fixes this by re-adding the missing memset of bounce buffer memory.

This is not a security patch because it does not address a vulnerability, but rather a functional issue that was causing problems in certain scenarios. It's more of a bug fix than a security fix.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are aimed at preventing a potential memory leak in the event of an incompletely cloned static lease. While this could potentially have implications for system stability and reliability, it does not directly address a security vulnerability such as a buffer overflow, injection vulnerability, or privilege escalation. Therefore, it is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it fixes a NULL dereference issue. NULL dereference can lead to program crashes, and in some cases, it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, which is a security concern. Therefore, any patch that fixes such issues can be considered a security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The changes made in the patch are related to better handling of invalid length or empty stuff in the Aireplay-ng test. This could potentially prevent issues such as buffer overflow or underflow, which are common security vulnerabilities. The patch adds checks to ensure that the length of the data being read is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the packet size before proceeding, which is a typical security measure.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the ndb_redis module. Memory leaks are generally considered as performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities. They can lead to reduced performance over time as the application consumes more and more memory, but they do not typically expose the system to unauthorized access or data breaches, which are the primary concerns of security patches.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a bug in the Linux kernel's scheduler, specifically in the sched_show_task() function. The bug causes a "suspicious RCU usage" warning, which is a sign of a potential race condition. The patch fixes this by adding a necessary RCU (Read-Copy-Update) read-side critical section, which is a technique used in concurrent programming to avoid race conditions.

While this patch does improve the stability and reliability of the system, it does not directly address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a use-after-free vulnerability in the netlink_recvmsg function. Use-after-free vulnerabilities are a type of security issue where a program continues to use memory after it has been freed, which can lead to a variety of security problems such as data corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution. 

In this case, the patch moves the call to netlink_cmsg_recv_pktinfo up a few lines to ensure it is called before the skb is freed, thus preventing the use-after-free condition.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the calculation of time base values in the av_interleaved_write_frame function. The developer has added type casting to int64_t to prevent potential overflow. While this could potentially lead to a crash or incorrect behavior, it doesn't seem to address a specific security vulnerability such as a buffer overflow, injection vulnerability, or privilege escalation. Therefore, it's more likely to be a non-security patch. However, without more context or a specific CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) reference, it's hard to be 100% certain.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing an uninitialized variable error that was identified by Coverity, a static code analysis tool. The patch initializes the 'sa' variable with zeros using the 'memset' function. This is a code quality improvement and does not directly address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is designed to clear the address in parse_addr() because some callers pass uninitialized structures. This is more of a reliability and correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. It's about making sure that later comparisons work properly, not about fixing a security hole or vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a null pointer dereference issue in the osd request error path. While null pointer dereference can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this context, it's more about avoiding a crash (improving system stability) rather than fixing a security hole. The patch does not seem to address any specific security vulnerability, hence it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it fixes a buffer overflow issue in the do_start() function. Buffer overflow is a common security issue where an application writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to crashes, incorrect behavior, or potential execution of harmful code. The patch replaces the sprintf function with snprintf, which is a safer alternative because it includes a parameter for the maximum length of the output, preventing buffer overflow.
security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a bug in the 'nid_range()' function where 'start' can overshoot 'end' if it does not begin on a page boundary. This is more of a functional issue rather than a security vulnerability. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug in the curl_json plugin related to array index and key handling, which was causing an off-by-one error and two metrics with the same identifier being created. It does not appear to be addressing any security vulnerabilities or adding any security features, hence it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the 'umount' function. Memory leaks are generally considered as performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities. They can lead to reduced performance or crashes, but they don't typically allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, which are common characteristics of security vulnerabilities.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the initialization of a member variable, as indicated by the commit message "Init member (thanks, valgrind)." This is typically a type of bug fix or improvement, but it does not directly address any security vulnerabilities or issues.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to initialization of the 'footer' variable in the 'Message' class. This is more likely to be a bug fix or a code improvement rather than a security-related change.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it addresses a potential out-of-bounds read issue in the bink codec. The patch adds a condition to check if the 'ref' variable is within the valid range (between 'ref_start' and 'ref_end'). If 'ref' is out of bounds, it logs an error and returns -1, preventing the out-of-bounds read. 

Out-of-bounds read issues can lead to crashes, unpredictable behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities, such as information disclosure or denial of service, hence this patch is considered a security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the video mode switching functionality in the x11_common.c file. The comparison operators in the if condition have been changed from '<' to '<='. This change seems to be more about functionality or performance rather than addressing a security vulnerability. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is modifying the XFREE macro to prevent it from freeing a NULL pointer under the Freescale MQX operating system. While this could potentially lead to a crash if the NULL pointer were attempted to be freed, it doesn't directly relate to the security of the system. It's more about stability and preventing potential crashes. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a potential null pointer dereference in the Bluetooth code of the Linux kernel. The null pointer dereference is a common type of security vulnerability that can lead to system crashes or potentially exploitable conditions. In this case, the patch adds a check to ensure that a connection exists before processing a pin_code_request_event, thus preventing the potential null pointer dereference.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). The patch addresses a potential use-after-free vulnerability, which is a type of security issue. Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. This can lead to a variety of adverse consequences, including program crashes, incorrect operation, and exploitable conditions for attackers. In this case, the patch fixes the issue by moving the `module_put()` function call to after the `ops->release()` function call, ensuring that the module isn't freed until after it's no longer in use.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it modifies the error handling of the 'unrar_open' function. Previously, if the 'offset' variable was less than 0, it would simply be set to 0 and the function would continue. However, this could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the 'offset' being less than 0 is indicative of a more serious problem.

In the patched version, if 'offset' is less than 0, several memory allocations are freed and the function returns an error code. This is a more secure way of handling this error condition, as it prevents potential resource leaks and ensures that the function does not continue executing with potentially invalid state.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a bug in the free_unnecessary_pages() function in the kernel's power management hibernate code. The bug causes the system to attempt to free too many pages in some cases, which triggers an error. The patch corrects this by adding a check to ensure that the number of pages to free is not greater than the available pages. 

This is a bug fix, but it does not appear to be related to security. It's more about system stability and correctness.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to memory allocation during auto-configuration time. The patch modifies the malloc function to use the NOWAIT flag instead of WAITOK, which means the function will not wait for memory to become available if it's not immediately available. It also adds a check to see if the memory allocation was successful. These changes seem to be more about improving the robustness and efficiency of the system rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a warning related to incorrect type in argument (different signedness) in the code. It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather a type mismatch that could potentially lead to bugs or undefined behavior. The patch is improving the code quality and maintainability, but it's not directly related to security.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a typo in a sanity check in the m88110_syscall() function. While sanity checks can be related to security, in this case, it seems to be more about the correct functioning of the system rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability. Therefore, it's more likely to be a non-security patch. However, without more context, it's hard to be 100% certain.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The change is checking the allocated pointer instead of the given pointer, which seems to be more of a bug fix or improvement in the code's logic rather than a security-related fix. There's no mention of any security vulnerabilities being addressed, nor does the change appear to directly involve any security features or functions.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the Indeo 5 decoder. It's adding code to free up memory that was not being released properly. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited in a way that compromises the system. In this case, there's no indication that the memory leak could be exploited for malicious purposes, so it's not a security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a bug in the megaraid driver where the irq number was being stored in an unsigned char, causing it to be truncated. This is a functional issue, not a security issue. The patch corrects the data type to properly store the irq number, fixing the functionality of the driver. There is no mention of any security vulnerabilities being addressed, hence it is not a security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a potential issue with negative array indexing in the BIO_debug_callback() function. The issue arises when BIO_snprintf() returns -1, which can happen on truncation or overflow. The patch fixes this by checking if the returned length is less than 0, and if so, setting it to 0 to avoid the negative array index. 

This is more of a robustness improvement rather than a security fix. It's about making the code more resilient to potential errors, but it doesn't directly address a specific security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a potential null pointer dereference issue in the drm_display_mode_from_vic_index() function. This is a type of bug fix, but it's not directly related to security. It's more about stability and reliability of the system. If the allocation of newmode fails, the system could crash when it tries to dereference the null pointer. This patch adds a check to prevent that from happening.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing an overflow issue in the tsc-frequency property of the target-i386. The author is changing the data type of tsc_khz from int to int64_t to avoid the overflow. This is more of a bug fix or an improvement rather than a security fix. There is no mention of any vulnerabilities being addressed, nor does it seem to be fixing any security-related issues.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential memory allocation failure during the wakeup banks initialization in the pinctrl-exynos.c file. If the memory allocation fails, the function will now return an ENOMEM error. This is a reliability improvement, not a security fix. It prevents a NULL pointer from being stored and later dereferenced, which could cause a system crash, but it does not address a vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is about memory management, specifically freeing up memory in an error case. It does not address any security vulnerabilities or issues, but rather is aimed at preventing memory leaks, which is a type of software bug.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is modifying the order of operations in the 'orinoco_process_scan_results' function in the 'orinoco' wireless driver. Specifically, it's changing when the 'spin_unlock_irqrestore' function is called. 

The 'spin_unlock_irqrestore' function is used to release a spinlock and restore the interrupt state. This is a critical operation in concurrent programming and operating systems, as it ensures that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner. 

In the original code, the spinlock was being released before the 'list_del' function was called to remove an entry from the 'scan_list'. In the patched code, the spinlock is not released until after the 'list_del' function is called. 

This change could prevent potential race conditions where another thread might access the 'scan_list' after the spinlock is released but before the entry is removed. Such race conditions can lead to crashes, incorrect behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, this patch is likely intended to fix a potential security issue, making it a security patch (SRP).
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is checking the return value of kmalloc(), a memory allocation function in the Linux kernel. If kmalloc() fails to allocate the requested block of memory, it returns NULL. The patch adds a check for this condition and if it occurs, the function returns -ENOMEM, indicating that the system is out of memory. 

This is a good practice for robustness and preventing potential system crashes due to out of memory conditions, but it does not directly address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is fixing a memory leak issue related to a tooltip in the Nautilus file manager. It's not addressing any security vulnerabilities or threats, but rather improving the software's performance and stability.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message indicates that the patch is intended to "Initialize lex->mqh structure" and "Fixes valgrind warnings." Valgrind is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. The changes in the code are related to initialization of a structure, which is typically done to prevent undefined behavior or bugs, but it doesn't seem to address any specific security vulnerability. Therefore, it's more likely to be a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue and ensuring that the string is properly terminated with a null character ('\0'). These are general code quality and reliability improvements, not specifically related to security. 

A security patch would typically address vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the system, such as buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or information disclosure vulnerabilities. This patch does not appear to address any such issues.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is related to the initialization of the Non-HDA Link Table (NHLT) in the Intel Skylake driver. It does not address any security vulnerabilities or issues, but rather it seems to be enhancing or fixing functionality of the driver. Therefore, it is not a security-related patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a functionality issue where the 'mkdir' command was not using the CURLOPT_NEW_DIRECTORY_PERMS as it should when sending a quote command to a SFTP server. Instead, it was sending fixed permissions. This is a bug fix related to functionality, not a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (A) Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch is modifying the function `audit_log_task_context()` in the kernel's audit subsystem. The changes are related to how the system handles security attributes of processes, specifically replacing the use of `security_getprocattr()` with `selinux_get_task_sid()` and `selinux_sid_to_string()`. 

The patch is intended to fix a deadlock issue, which is a situation where a process cannot proceed because the resources it needs are being held by another process. Deadlocks can potentially be exploited in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, making this a security-related patch.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP).

The patch is addressing an out-of-bounds (oob) issue in the dex code. Out-of-bounds issues are security vulnerabilities that occur when a program reads or writes data outside the bounds of an array, buffer, or other data structures. This can lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. 

In this patch, the developer added a condition to check if the index 'i' is greater than or equal to the size of the class (bin->header.class_size). If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration, preventing an out-of-bounds read or write. This is a typical way to fix an out-of-bounds vulnerability, hence it is a security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). 

The changes in this patch are primarily related to memory management. The author has initialized a variable 'ret' to 0 and added a 'free' function to deallocate memory assigned to 'ivdata'. These changes are typically made to prevent memory leaks or to optimize the code, and they do not directly address any security vulnerabilities. 

However, it's important to note that while these changes can indirectly improve the security of the software by preventing potential exploits related to memory management, they are not specifically targeted at fixing known security issues. Therefore, this patch is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is designed to avoid out-of-bounds access in the mwifiex_get_common_rates function. Out-of-bounds access is a common security issue that can lead to serious vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow attacks, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. In this patch, the author has added checks to ensure that array indexes are within bounds before accessing the rate2 and tmp arrays, thus preventing potential out-of-bounds access.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are primarily focused on improving pointer hygiene and preventing a potential memory bug. While these changes can indirectly contribute to the overall security of the system by preventing potential crashes or undefined behavior, they do not directly address a known security vulnerability or add any new security features. Therefore, it is more appropriate to classify this patch as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is fixing a memory leak in the iop13xx/pci code of the ARM architecture. Memory leaks can lead to performance issues over time as they consume memory resources, but they do not directly relate to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is considered a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The reason is that it includes the use of the `bzero` function after `malloc` in several places. The `bzero` function is used to clear or zero out memory, which can be a security measure to prevent leaking sensitive data from previous memory contents. This is a common practice in secure programming to ensure that no sensitive data is unintentionally left in memory that could be accessed by an attacker.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The changes in this patch are primarily focused on memory management, specifically fixing memory leaks. It does not address any security vulnerabilities or implement any security features. Therefore, it is not a security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is designed to prevent a specific type of invalid usage where a monitored file and event_control are in different cgroups. This could lead to incorrect notifications and potential NULL pointer access. However, it does not appear to address a specific security vulnerability, but rather it prevents a potential system crash due to invalid usage. Therefore, it is more of a reliability/stability improvement rather than a security improvement.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is addressing an out-of-bounds read issue, which is a type of bug that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, but it's not directly related to security. The patch is increasing the size of an array to prevent this out-of-bounds read, which is more of a stability or reliability improvement rather than a security enhancement.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing an off-by-one error in the check of the number of cports a host-device supports. This is a bug fix, but it doesn't appear to be related to security. It's more about the correct functioning of the system rather than preventing unauthorized access or data breaches.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a use-after-free bug in the Distributed Lock Manager (dlm) in the Linux kernel. While use-after-free bugs can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, the patch description does not indicate any security implications. Instead, it seems to be addressing a race condition that could lead to incorrect behavior, but not a security breach. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential null pointer dereference issue in the vt6655 driver. The author added a check to ensure that the 'bssid' is not NULL before proceeding, which is a common bug fix or stability improvement, but it does not directly relate to security. 

Security patches typically involve fixes that prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, or other vulnerabilities that could be exploited maliciously. This patch does not appear to address such issues.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing an off-by-one error in the calculation of the clear interrupt register in the InfiniBand hardware driver. This is more of a bug fix rather than a security vulnerability patch. It's adjusting a condition from "< 31" to "< 32", which is a typical kind of fix for an off-by-one error. There's no mention of any security implications in the commit message.
security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is initializing a pointer in the node class constructor to prevent crashes with some man pages when built with gcc4. This is more of a stability improvement rather than a security fix. Therefore, it doesn't seem to address any security vulnerabilities or threats.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a failure handling in the 'ceph_writepages_start' function. If 'ceph_osdc_new_request' fails, the patch ensures that the page is unlocked and -ENOMEM is returned. This is more of a reliability and robustness improvement rather than a security fix. There are no security vulnerabilities being addressed or any security features being added or improved.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a bug that causes boot hangs on a system with 16 logical CPUs. It does not seem to address any security vulnerabilities or issues. Instead, it corrects a problem where the invalidate tlb vector was being sent to the sender itself, causing the system to hang.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the is_subclass_of() function. Memory leaks are generally considered as performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities. They can lead to an application consuming more memory than necessary, but they don't typically allow for unauthorized access or data breaches. Therefore, this patch is more about improving the software's efficiency rather than its security.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a NULL pointer dereference bug in the USB gadget subsystem of the Linux kernel. While NULL pointer dereference bugs can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, the patch description does not indicate any security implications.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug that causes a system crash (NULL pointer dereference) when a connection attempt fails. It does not appear to be addressing a vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access or data, which would be characteristic of a security patch. Instead, it's improving the system's stability and reliability, which is typical of a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message indicates that the patch is intended to fix a memory leak issue ("we were leaking 3KB every time the entry guards changed, every time the controller called saveconf, and every 20 minutes"). While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, they are typically not directly related to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is more likely to be a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a race condition issue in the system, which is a type of bug that can cause unpredictable behavior, but it's not directly related to security. The author is modifying the way interrupts are handled to prevent this race condition, but there's no mention of any security vulnerabilities being addressed. Therefore, it's a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is addressing a bug related to performance (the STRNXFRM function running slower when the tailoring rule contains contraction). The fix involves freeing up memory if user-defined collation fails to load, which is more of a performance and stability improvement rather than a security fix. Therefore, it's not a security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a memory leak issue in the code. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited in a way that compromises the security of the system. In this case, there is no indication that the memory leak could be exploited for malicious purposes, so it would be classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The reason is that it addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference issue. If the condition `fd_nfiles < 3` is true, the code will not attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, which could lead to a system crash or other undefined behavior. This kind of patch is typically considered a security improvement because it prevents potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to error handling when parsing yara hex strings. The developer has added a couple of lines to free up memory (free(res);) before returning NULL in case of an error. This is more of a bug fix or an improvement in error handling, rather than a security fix. A security patch would typically involve changes that directly address a vulnerability or a potential security risk.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the ap_module_init() function. Memory leaks can lead to performance issues over time as they consume system resources, but they do not directly relate to the security of the system. Therefore, this patch is considered a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The reason is that the patch addresses a memory leak issue that could be exploited by an attacker to spray the memory of the application or trigger an out-of-memory condition. This is a security concern as it could potentially lead to unauthorized access or denial of service. The patch fixes this by ensuring the temporary filename memory is released, thus preventing the memory leak.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a memory leak issue in the LogFS file system. Memory leaks can lead to system instability over time as they consume more and more resources, but they do not directly relate to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is not a security patch. It's more about improving the system's stability and performance.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The patch is adding a check to ensure that the size of an array does not exceed a maximum limit (ARY_MAX_SIZE) or go below zero. If the size of the array is outside these bounds, an error is raised. This is a common security measure to prevent buffer overflow attacks, where an attacker might try to write more data to a buffer (in this case, an array) than it can hold, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is introduced to fix a memory leak issue in the drivers/net/wan code. The author noticed that there was a missing kfree, which is a function used to free previously allocated memory in the kernel. If not properly freed, it could lead to memory leaks which can degrade the performance of the system over time. However, this is not directly related to security, but rather to resource management and system stability. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it adds a condition to check if the `data_size` is less than or equal to zero. This is a common security measure to prevent potential buffer overflow or underflow attacks, which can occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, or when a program attempts to read or write data from a negative index of a buffer. 

In this case, if `data_size` is less than or equal to zero, the function will return `AVERROR_INVALIDDATA`, preventing any further processing of the data. This is a typical way to handle potentially unsafe data in a secure manner.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential issue where a dma_pool_alloc() function might fail to allocate memory. If this happens, the patch ensures that the container context is freed to prevent memory leaks. This is more of a reliability and stability improvement rather than a security fix. There are no mentions of vulnerabilities, exploits, or security issues being addressed.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a potential security vulnerability where an attacker could cause an out-of-bounds access by sending a too short HT information/capability IE. The patch fixes this by checking the length of the HT IEs and ignoring those that are too short. This is a clear example of a security patch as it directly addresses a potential exploit that could be used by an attacker.
security || This patch appears to be a Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch is addressing an overread error in the function `validate_opcode`. Overread errors can lead to unexpected behavior, including access to sensitive information, crashes, or other security vulnerabilities. The patch adds a check to ensure that the bytecode does not exceed the maximum allowable size, which would prevent the overread error. 

Therefore, this patch is intended to fix a potential security vulnerability, making it a Security Patch (SRP).
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing error handling in the 'tx_frame_nl' function of the 'mac80211_hwsim' module. It corrects two problems: the netlink skb is never freed if 'nla_put()' fails, and 'genlmsg_unicast()' can fail if the netlink socket is full. These are functional issues, not security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is not intended to fix a security issue, but to improve the reliability and stability of the system.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is aimed at fixing a memory leak issue in the tracing/filters subsystem of the kernel. It does not address any security vulnerabilities or threats, but rather improves the system's performance by preventing memory leaks when clearing filters.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). The changes in the patch are primarily related to code refactoring, debugging, and minor adjustments in the code logic.

security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is fixing an out-of-array write issue in the qpeg codec. Out-of-array writes are a common type of security vulnerability where data is written beyond the boundaries of allocated memory. This can lead to a variety of security issues, including buffer overflow attacks, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. 

In this patch, the author has added a check to ensure that the 'height' variable is not less than 0 before proceeding, which would prevent the out-of-array write from occurring. This is a typical way to fix such vulnerabilities, hence it is a security-related patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is designed to fix a hang in the program when a certain condition is met - specifically, when a thread waiting in io_getevents is destroyed by another thread. This is a functional issue, not a security issue. The patch does not address any vulnerabilities, exploits, or security flaws. Instead, it improves the reliability of the system by ensuring the program can exit as expected under these conditions.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to memory management, specifically freeing up memory that was previously allocated to the 'str' variable. While good memory management can indirectly contribute to the overall security of a system, this patch does not directly address a security vulnerability or implement a security feature, so it is not classified as a security patch.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch is fixing a division by zero error, which is a common security issue. Division by zero can cause a program to crash or behave unpredictably, which can be exploited by an attacker. The patch adds a check to prevent this from happening, which is a security improvement.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are primarily for error handling and memory management. The developer added checks to ensure that the 'in' and 'result' strings are not NULL before attempting to free them. This is a common practice to prevent runtime errors, but it doesn't directly address a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is designed to prevent a buffer overflow vulnerability. The commit message "do not overflow ifr.ifr_addr" indicates that the patch is intended to fix a potential security issue where the ifr.ifr_addr buffer could be overflowed. 

In the code, the memcpy function is replaced with a safer version that includes a boundary check. The MIN function is used to ensure that the size of the copied data does not exceed the size of the destination buffer. This is a common technique to prevent buffer overflow, which is a well-known security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch primarily deals with functionality improvements and bug fixes in the overlay file system (overlayfs). It includes changes to how permissions are calculated, fixes for zero size xattr, buffer allocation in ovl_copy_xattr, moving super block magic number to magic.h, copying attributes for the root inode, checking permissions before copy-up, and checking dentry positiveness in ovl_cleanup_whiteouts(). 

While these changes can indirectly improve the security of the system by preventing crashes and ensuring correct behavior, they do not directly address any known security vulnerabilities or add new security features, hence it is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message indicates that it's a fix for a memory leak issue related to incoming IPv6 TCP connections. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues or crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. In this case, there's no indication that the memory leak could be exploited in such a way, so it's more likely to be a reliability or performance fix rather than a security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The change is addressing a signedness issue, which is a common source of security vulnerabilities. The patch adds a check to ensure that the 'slot_id' is not less than 0, which could potentially prevent a negative array index vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is fixing a NULL dereference bug in the 'sd_create' function of the 'sheepdog' component. While NULL dereference bugs can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, the bug is causing a core dump (i.e., the program is crashing), not a security breach. The patch is simply initializing the 'aio_context' to prevent this crash. There is no mention of any security implications in the commit message, and the fix does not appear to be addressing any security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the MMCONFIG error path. Memory leaks are generally considered as performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a sign bug in the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) asihpi driver. The bug is related to the calculation of bytes_per_sec, which is unsigned. If snd_pcm_format_width() returns an error, it would not be noticed because of the unsigned nature of bytes_per_sec. The patch corrects this by introducing a signed integer 'width' to capture the return value of snd_pcm_format_width() and then checks if 'width' is less than 0 or if bytes_per_sec equals 0, in which case it returns an error. 

This is a bug fix patch, but it does not address a security vulnerability, hence it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is (B) a non-security patch (NSP).

While this patch does improve the stability of the system, it does not address a specific security vulnerability, so it is not classified as a security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The commit message indicates that it fixes a segmentation fault caused by a malformed ARM ELF. A segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong to you." It's a mechanism that prevents you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segmentation fault, you know you are doing something wrong with memory  such as accessing a variable that has already been freed or writing to a read-only portion of memory. The protection against this kind of vulnerabilities makes the patch a security-related one.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the qlcnic network driver. It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather a performance and stability issue. The memory leak could potentially lead to system instability or crashes, but it doesn't expose the system to unauthorized access or data leakage, which are typical concerns of a security patch.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that the patch is addressing potential buffer overruns, which are a common security issue. Buffer overruns can lead to arbitrary code execution, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or control over a system.

security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the handling of root pathnames in the NFSv4 (Network File System version 4) protocol. The author has added a condition to handle a case where a root pathname is sent as a zero component. This seems to be more of a functionality or compatibility improvement rather than a security fix. 

However, it's important to note that without additional context or a clear statement from the author or maintainer, it can sometimes be difficult to definitively classify a patch as security or non-security just from the code changes.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The commit message "remove pointer to freed secret object" suggests that the patch is addressing a potential use-after-free vulnerability, which is a type of security issue. The code changes also support this, as they seem to be removing a reference to a freed object, which is a common way to fix use-after-free vulnerabilities.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a NULL dereference bug in the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) jack module. While NULL dereference bugs can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, it appears to be more of a stability issue rather than a security issue.

This is a good practice for robust error handling, but it does not directly address a security vulnerability. Therefore, it is a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The commit message "PNIO: Fix another potential OOB write" indicates that this patch is intended to fix a potential Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) write vulnerability. An OOB write occurs when data is written to a buffer, but it exceeds the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. This can lead to a variety of security issues, including crashes, data corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution. 

In the code changes, we can see that the patch is modifying how memory is allocated and copied for the `moduleNameStr` field of the `io_data_object` structure. It appears to be ensuring that no more than `MAX_NAMELENGTH` characters are copied into `moduleNameStr`, which would prevent an OOB write if the source string is longer than `MAX_NAMELENGTH`. 

Therefore, this patch is addressing a security issue and can be classified as a Security Patch (SRP).
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is changing the memory allocation function from kzalloc to kcalloc in the rtl8188eu driver. This change is not related to any security vulnerability or enhancement.

security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a functional issue in the blk-mq (block multi-queue) subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically in the blk_mq_freeze_queue() function. The issue is related to the handling of nested freezing operations, which was causing misbehavior due to the invocation of percpu_ref_kill() on an already killed ref. The patch corrects this by allowing the outermost freeze attempt to kill and kick the queue, while nested ones simply wait for the ref to reach zero. 

This is a functional fix, not a security fix. There is no mention of any vulnerabilities being addressed, nor any security implications of the issue.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The reason is that the patch is designed to prevent an out-of-buffer write, which is a common security issue.

security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is modifying the m_ssl_gnutls.cpp file, which is related to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) - a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. 

The specific change is adding a condition to check if 'dh_alloc' is not initialized, and if so, it returns without generating Diffie-Hellman parameters (gnutls_dh_params_generate2). Diffie-Hellman is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel, and is used in SSL.

This change could prevent potential security issues, such as attempting to generate Diffie-Hellman parameters when 'dh_alloc' is not initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is likely intended to improve the security of the system.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the net/ncsi module of the Linux kernel. While NULL pointer dereference issues can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, the patch does not indicate that this particular issue could be exploited for malicious purposes. Instead, it seems to be more about improving the stability and reliability of the system by preventing a potential crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. 

The patch adds a check for a NULL return from the nla_nest_start function and returns an error if this is the case, preventing the NULL pointer dereference. This is a common type of bug fix in software development and does not necessarily indicate a security issue. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, this patch can be classified as a non-security patch (NSP).
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is about exposing the buf_overrun count through the proc interface. It's a change that allows userspace to see dropped characters due to flip buffer overruns, which were previously invisible. This is more of a functionality improvement rather than a security fix. There's no mention of any vulnerabilities being addressed, or any security-related improvements being made.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug related to an unbalanced mutex in the ALSA hda-codec. This is a bug fix patch, not a security patch. A security patch would typically address vulnerabilities that could be exploited maliciously, such as buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or information leaks. This patch is fixing a synchronization issue, which is a type of software bug, but not a security vulnerability.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a double free issue on device stop in the vhost code. While double free issues can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, the context provided does not indicate that this is being exploited in a way that would compromise the security of the system. Instead, it seems to be more of a stability or reliability fix, which would categorize it as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to thread synchronization and memory management, specifically to prevent a block from being freed by another thread during the decompression process. This is more of a bug fix to ensure the correct operation of the software, rather than a security patch that would fix vulnerabilities or enhance the security of the system.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The change made in this patch is to return NULL if the input string is NULL. This is more of a functionality or stability improvement rather than a security fix. It prevents the program from trying to allocate memory and copy a NULL string, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, but it doesn't directly address a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the dmaengine of the bcm2835-dma. Memory leaks are generally considered as performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities. They can lead to reduced performance over time as the system's memory gets filled with data that's no longer in use. However, they do not typically allow for unauthorized access or control, which is a key characteristic of security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The change is made to prevent a potential overflow on large blocks, which seems to be more of a stability or performance issue rather than a security vulnerability. The patch increases the size of the 'residual' array by one, which is likely to prevent an out-of-bounds write or read, but it's not directly related to security. It's more about ensuring the software behaves correctly with large blocks.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to locking mechanisms and memory management in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for the s390 architecture. The author has added a down_write and up_write call to ensure proper locking when setting the allow_gmap_hpage_1m bitfield in the mm context. This seems to be more about ensuring correct behavior and preventing potential race conditions rather than addressing a specific security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a device removal issue in the ASoC WM8903 codec driver. It ensures that the IRQ (Interrupt Request) is freed upon device removal, which prevents a failure when request_irq is called upon subsequent device initialization. This is a functional issue, not a security issue.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is designed to avoid a potential null pointer dereference error, which is a common type of programming bug. While null pointer dereference can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this case, the patch does not appear to be addressing a specific security vulnerability, but rather is improving the robustness of the code to prevent a potential crash or undefined behavior. 

Therefore, it is more appropriate to classify this patch as a non-security patch (NSP).
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the macsec module of the Linux kernel. When the function skb_to_sgvec fails, it frees the memory that was previously allocated to prevent memory leaks. This is a bug fix related to resource management, not a security vulnerability fix. 

Security patches typically involve fixing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, such as buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or information disclosure vulnerabilities. This patch does not appear to address any such issues.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a race condition vulnerability in the memory management (mm) for maps function. A race condition is a type of security vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by an attacker to cause unexpected behavior in a system. 

In this case, the patch adds a mutex lock to prevent the race condition from occurring. The mutex lock ensures that the task's memory management structure (mm) and credentials (creds) are not changed during the execution of the function, which could otherwise lead to security issues. 

The author of the patch also mentions that it fixes a minor problem where the function could return NULL unless a security check fails or the task exits, which could potentially lead to further issues. 

Therefore, given that the patch is addressing a security vulnerability and enhancing the security of the system, it can be classified as a security patch (SRP).
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it adds a check for integer overflow in the tile array allocation in the j2kdec.c file. Integer overflow is a common security issue that can lead to unexpected behavior, including potential security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow. In this case, if the multiplication of s->numXtiles and s->numYtiles exceeds INT_MAX/sizeof(J2kTile), it will return an error, preventing the overflow.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the tracing subsystem of the Linux kernel. The author has identified that the function instance_rmdir() was not properly freeing the memory allocated for file->filter. The patch fixes this by calling free_event_filter() in the function remove_event_file_dir(). 

While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, this patch does not appear to address a specific security vulnerability. Therefore, it is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a deadlock issue in the distributed lock manager (dlm) during recovery. It modifies the lock granting logic to prevent a potential "in place" conversion deadlock that could occur during recovery. This is a functional issue related to system stability and performance, not a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to memory management, specifically freeing up memory that was previously allocated.

security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are aimed at handling a specific error condition in the reiserfs filesystem code, specifically dealing with "dirty non-uptodate buffers". This is more of a bug fix or stability improvement rather than a security fix. There is no mention of any vulnerabilities being addressed, nor does the patch appear to alter any security controls or protections.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The addition of the `bzero(r, sizeof(*r));` line is a common security practice to prevent the use of uninitialized memory. This is because it clears, or zeroes out, the memory space before it's used, which can prevent potential information leaks or other security vulnerabilities.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the nbd (network block device) driver. It's moving the allocation of memory for nbd_dev to a different location in the code to ensure that the memory is released properly and not just returning the error value.

security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a memory leak in the UIO (Userspace I/O) subsystem of the Linux kernel. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues or crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or escalate privileges, which is not indicated here.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a potential security vulnerability where an invalid channel count could cause the loop 'shorten_decode_close' to write and free out of the array boundary. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow, which is a common type of security vulnerability. The patch fixes this by setting the invalid channel count to 0, thus preventing the potential overflow.
security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch seem to be related to the initialization and loading of the ARM architecture in the QEMU emulator, specifically in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) loader. There are no explicit security fixes or vulnerability mitigations mentioned in the commit message or the code changes. Therefore, it is more likely to be a functional or performance improvement rather than a security patch.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a file descriptor leak issue, which is a resource management problem rather than a security vulnerability. The 'close(fd)' statements added in the patch are meant to ensure that the file descriptor is properly closed under various error conditions, preventing the leak. This is more about improving the robustness and reliability of the software, rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is designed to handle a fail-safe condition in the Texas Instrument's shared transport driver to avoid kernel panic. It does not address any security vulnerabilities or exploits, but rather it is meant to improve the stability and reliability of the system in case of unexpected behavior from the chip or UART driver.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing an uninitialized variable warning in the spi_mpc8xxx driver. It's not addressing any security vulnerabilities or issues, but rather it's improving the code quality and preventing potential bugs. This is a typical example of a non-security patch.

It doesn't seem to address any security vulnerabilities or issues, but rather it's aimed at preventing crashes and improving the stability of the software.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a read buffer overflow issue in the code, which is a security concern. Buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service, making them a common target for attackers. The patch fixes this by changing how the code handles NULL values, ensuring that the buffer is not overflowed.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing an off-by-one error in the blkdev file. Off-by-one errors are a common type of programming mistake, but they are not necessarily security vulnerabilities. In this case, the commit message describes the error as "harmless", suggesting that it does not pose a security risk.

The change in the patch is to the length parameter in a call to the strlcpy function. This function is used to copy a string, and the length parameter determines how many characters to copy. The patch increases the length by one, presumably to include the null character at the end of the string. This is a typical way to fix an off-by-one error.

However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively whether this patch is related to security or not. But based on the information provided, it seems more likely to be a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch is designed to prevent unsafe reads by validating port comparison byte code. The author mentions that previously, the code could allow a malicious user to make the kernel read 4 bytes beyond the end of the bytecode array. This is a security issue as it could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. The patch fixes this by adding a validation function to ensure that a second inet_diag_bc_op struct can fit in the bytecode array.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the devlink module of the Linux kernel. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues over time, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited in a way that compromises the system's security. In this case, the patch description does not indicate any security implications, hence it is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a Security Patch (SRP). 

The patch is adding checks to ensure there are enough bytes left in the buffer before proceeding with the decoding process. This is a common security measure to prevent buffer overflow attacks, where an attacker tries to write more data into a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. 

In this case, if the buffer does not have enough space, the function returns an error (AVERROR_INVALIDDATA), preventing any potential overflow.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch is modifying the conditions for key length validation in an encryption algorithm. The original code was checking if the key length was less than the minimum or greater than the maximum allowed length. The patch changes this to include the minimum and maximum lengths themselves as invalid. 

This is a security-related change because it directly affects the strength of the encryption. If a key length that's too short or too long is allowed, it could potentially weaken the encryption or cause it to fail. Therefore, this patch is intended to improve the security of the system.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is correcting the signedness of a local variable in the firewire: ohci driver. This is a code quality improvement and does not directly address a security vulnerability. It's more about the correctness of the code rather than fixing a security issue.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug in the kconfig system of the Linux kernel where it could enter an infinite loop under certain conditions. This is a functional issue, not a security vulnerability. The patch is fixing a problem with the system's stability and reliability, not addressing a potential exploit or data breach.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is fixing a null pointer dereference issue in the watchdog driver. While null pointer dereference issues can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, in this context, it appears to be more of a stability or reliability issue rather than a security one. The patch is changing the way the driver fetches its specific data, which was previously done incorrectly. This is more of a bug fix rather than a security fix.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to the memory management subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically the handling of NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) hinting faults. The patch ensures that a hinting fault is not double accounted for if another task has already handled it. There is no mention of any security vulnerabilities being addressed, nor does the patch appear to include any security-related fixes. Therefore, it is more likely to be a performance or reliability improvement rather than a security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a potential issue where stale or freed data could be read from the DEV_INFO ioctl if the device disappears between an early mutex unlock and data being copied from the device structure. This is more of a reliability and data integrity issue rather than a security vulnerability. 

The patch moves the mutex unlock operation to ensure that the entire device info read operation is performed under lock, preventing the possibility of reading stale or freed data. This is a typical example of a race condition fix, which is generally considered a part of normal software maintenance and bug fixing, not necessarily a security patch. 

However, it's important to note that while this patch doesn't directly address a security vulnerability, maintaining data integrity and preventing race conditions are important aspects of overall system security.
security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The commit message "Fix zlul crash in sdb" suggests that this patch is intended to fix a crash issue, not to address a security vulnerability. The code change also seems to be handling a null pointer, which is a common source of crashes, but not necessarily a security concern. Therefore, it's more likely to be a non-security patch. However, without more context about the software and its vulnerabilities, this is an educated guess.
security || This patch can be considered as a Security Patch (SRP). 

The reason is that it introduces a new function `_cg_memcpy` that performs a sanity check before copying memory from source to destination. This function checks if the number of bytes to be copied is less than 1 or more than 2^31. If the condition is met, it logs an error message and returns without performing the copy. This is a security measure to prevent buffer overflow attacks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is fixing a NULL pointer dereference bug in the net: sendmsg function. While this could potentially lead to a crash, it is not directly related to security vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation, code execution, or information disclosure. It's more about stability and correctness of the system.
security || This patch is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is designed to prevent users from attempting to delete the root IMAP folder.

security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The patch addresses a potential issue where the /dev/mem file could wrap around and cause applications to read or write incorrect regions of memory by accident. This could potentially be exploited to cause unintended behavior or compromise the security of the system. Therefore, this patch is intended to improve the security of the system by preventing this from happening.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are related to memory management, specifically freeing up memory that was previously allocated. This is typically done to prevent memory leaks, which can degrade performance over time but are not typically associated with security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is more likely to be a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the code. While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, they are not typically classified as security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited in a way that compromises the security of the system. In this case, there is no indication that the memory leak could be exploited for malicious purposes, so it would be classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). It enforces access control for creating and deleting unmanaged snapshots, but it does not address a specific security vulnerability. Instead, it improves the overall robustness of the system's access control mechanisms.
security || This patch (B) is a non-security patch (NSP). 

The changes in this patch are primarily aimed at fixing a warning about potential uninitialized use of variables and removing trailing whitespace. The variables 'addr' and 'addr6' are initialized to NULL to prevent the warning. This is more of a code quality improvement than a security fix. 

There are no changes that directly address any known security vulnerabilities, such as fixing insecure data handling, patching security holes, or improving the security features of the system. Therefore, it is not a security-related patch.
security || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is related to preserving the x2APIC LDR on INIT in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for x86 architecture. It doesn't seem to address any specific security vulnerabilities or threats, but rather it seems to be aimed at improving or fixing functionality.
security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP).

The patch addresses a buffer overflow issue in the `pkginfofind` function. Buffer overflow is a common security issue where an application writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can lead to crashes, incorrect behavior, or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

In this patch, the `sprintf` function, which does not check the length of the input and can cause buffer overflow, is replaced with `snprintf`, which includes a length parameter to prevent writing past the end of the buffer. This is a clear indication that the patch is intended to fix a security issue.
security || This patch is (B) a non-security patch (NSP). It addresses a deadlock issue in memory management, specifically in the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) handling of the memory control group (memcg). It does not appear to fix any security vulnerabilities.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module of the Linux kernel. When the function kvm_create_pit() fails, the workqueue that was created is not destroyed, leading to a memory leak. This patch adds a call to destroy_workqueue() in the failure cleanup code to ensure the workqueue is properly cleaned up. 

While memory leaks can potentially lead to performance issues and crashes, this patch does not appear to address a specific security vulnerability. Therefore, it is classified as a non-security patch.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The patch is addressing an issue where some callers pass uninitialized structures, and it clears the address to ensure later comparisons work properly. This seems to be more of a functionality or stability improvement rather than a security fix. However, without more context or information about potential security implications, it's difficult to say definitively.
security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). The changes made in this patch are primarily to handle a potential hardware or DMA error, not to address a specific security vulnerability. The patch modifies the way the system handles a zeroed location to prevent accessing a potentially NULL or hardware-owned index in the global table. This is more about improving the robustness of the system in the face of errors, rather than addressing a security issue.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a memory leak issue by ensuring that the 'real_path' variable is initialized to NULL and then freeing it if it's not NULL. This is a common practice to prevent memory leaks in C programming. Memory leaks can lead to performance issues but they are not typically considered security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch is more about improving the software's efficiency and stability, rather than addressing a security concern.
security || This patch appears to be a security patch (SRP). The reason is that it addresses a potential crash in the IP stack due to a bogus IPCB area from a bridged packet. Crashes can often be exploited for security vulnerabilities, so patches that prevent crashes often fall into the category of security patches.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a bug that causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference, which is a type of crash. While this could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes, the patch itself does not directly address a security vulnerability but rather a stability issue.

security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP). 

The patch addresses a security vulnerability where a malicious user could provoke mkstemp failure and race to create a symlink with the selected temporary file name, thus causing the qemu process (usually root owned) to open through the symlink, overwriting an attacker-chosen file. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2012-2652. 

The patch modifies the get_tmp_filename function to return an int (not void), so that it can inform its two callers of those failures. It also updates both callers (in block.c and vvfat.c) to propagate temp-file-creation failure to their callers. This helps to prevent the snapshot mode $TMPDIR symlink attack.

This is a functional improvement rather than a security fix. There is no mention of any vulnerabilities being addressed, nor does the code change appear to affect security in any way.
security || This patch is a security patch (SRP). 

The patch modifies the strncpy() function calls to ensure that the copied string is null-terminated. This is a common security practice to prevent buffer overflow attacks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The strncpy() function does not null-terminate the destination string if the source string's length is greater than or equal to the size of the destination buffer. This can lead to reading uninitialized memory or memory that belongs to other variables, causing undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. 

By subtracting 1 from the size of the destination buffer in the strncpy() function calls, the patch ensures that there is always space for a null character at the end of the string, even if the source string is as long as the destination buffer. This makes the code safer and prevents potential security issues.
security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is designed to fix a warning that was reported during fuzzing with syzkaller. Fuzzing is a technique used to discover coding errors and security loopholes in software, operating systems, or networks by inputting massive amounts of random data, called fuzz, to the system in an attempt to make it crash. 

The warning indicates a potential vulnerability that could lead to a kernel panic, which is a type of error the operating system cannot easily recover from and which can lead to system crashes. 

The patch fixes this by preventing a reset being sent to already closed sockets, which is the same fix that was applied to TCP in a previous commit. This is a security-related change as it prevents potential misuse of the system resources and maintains the stability and security of the system.
non-security || This patch appears to be a non-security patch (NSP).

The patch is fixing an arithmetic error in the code, specifically the value of NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_MAX. It's not addressing a specific security vulnerability, but rather correcting a mistake in the code that could lead to unexpected behavior. 

The patch also replaces a return of an error value with a BUG_ON statement, which is a way of asserting that a certain condition should never be true. If the condition is true, it indicates a serious bug in the code. This is more about ensuring the correctness of the code rather than addressing a security issue. 

Therefore, this patch is more about code correctness and reliability rather than security.
non-security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch is addressing a space allocation issue in the btrfs filesystem. When the filesystem runs out of space, it fails to write data even if some space is freed up.

Therefore, it is more likely to be a functional improvement or bug fix rather than a security patch.
non-security || This patch is (A) a security patch (SRP).

The patch replaces the use of the mktemp function with mkstemp in the proxy_cache.c file. The mktemp function creates a unique temporary file, but it can lead to race conditions that can be exploited for unauthorized access or information disclosure. This is because the file name is known before the file is created, which can allow an attacker to create a symlink with the same name before the legitimate file is created.

On the other hand, mkstemp also creates a unique temporary file, but it opens the file and returns a file descriptor, which avoids the race condition. The patch also adds a call to fchmod to set the file permissions, which can help to restrict access to the file.

Therefore, this patch is addressing a security issue, making it a security patch.
non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP).

The change in the patch is related to the order of arguments in the strncpy function. The original code had the size argument in the wrong place, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows are a common security issue where an application writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

In the patched code, the size of the destination buffer 'loginname' is correctly placed as the third argument to strncpy, which is the maximum number of characters to be copied from 'name'. This change helps prevent buffer overflow by ensuring no more than 'sizeof loginname' characters are copied from 'name', thus making it a security patch.
non-security || This patch is a (B) non-security patch (NSP).
