non-security || To determine whether this patch is a security patch or a non-security patch, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

In the patch, the following changes are made:

1. In the `r_core_config_init` function in `cconfig.c`, a new preference `esil.breakoninvalid` is added with the default value set to "false". This preference is used to specify whether to break ESIL execution when an instruction is invalid.

2. In the `r_core_esil_step` function in `cmd_anal.c`, the value of `esil.breakoninvalid` preference is retrieved using `r_config_get_i` function. If `breakoninvalid` is true, a message is printed indicating that execution has stopped in an invalid instruction.

Based on the changes made in the patch, it can be inferred that this patch is a security patch (SRP). The addition of the `esil.breakoninvalid` preference and the corresponding logic to break execution in case of an invalid instruction suggests that this patch addresses a vulnerability related to invalid instructions in the ESIL execution.
