false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the function `vlv_infoframe_enabled` in the `intel_hdmi.c` file of the `i915` driver. The purpose of this function is to check if the infoframe is enabled for a given encoder.

The patch introduces a new variable `intel_dig_port` of type `struct intel_digital_port` and initializes it with the value of `enc_to_dig_port(encoder)`. This variable represents the digital port associated with the encoder.

Next, the patch adds a new variable `port` and assigns it the value of `intel_dig_port->port`. This variable represents the port associated with the digital port.

The patch then modifies the return statement of the function. It checks if the `port` matches the port value obtained from the register `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK` and if so, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `val` and `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary check to ensure that the infoframe is enabled only for the correct port. This can help prevent potential issues or misconfigurations. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

This change is made to ensure uniformity and compatibility with device tree (DT) usage.

The patch modifies the `__ae_match` function to compare the `fwnode_handle` instead of the `device_node`. Similarly, the `find_ae` function is updated to accept a `fwnode_handle` parameter instead of `device_node`. The `hnae_get_handle` function is also modified to use `fwnode_handle` instead of `device_node`.

In addition, the `hns_nic_priv` structure is updated to include a `fwnode_handle` pointer instead of a `device_node` pointer.

Overall, this patch seems to be a necessary change to ensure compatibility and uniformity in the `hnae` driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing an unnecessary check in the ip6t_SYNPROXY module of the netfilter subsystem. The patch suggests that ip6_route_output() will never return a NULL pointer, so the check for NULL can be removed.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change removes unnecessary code and does not introduce any new risks or issues.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

2. The TODO item related to the TMU (Timer Management Unit) is marked as completed, indicating that this patch addresses a long-standing issue.

3. The code block that calculates the shift, multiplier, and maximum/minimum delta values for the clock event device (ced) is removed and replaced with a call to clockevents_config(). This simplifies the code and relies on the helper function to handle the configuration.

4. The clockevents_config() function is called with the clock event device (ced) and the rate parameter. This configures the clock event device with the provided rate.

5. The clockevents_register_device() function call is removed, and instead, the clockevents_config_and_register() function is called. This function not only configures the clock event device but also registers it with the clock event subsystem.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It improves code maintainability, addresses a long-standing issue, and uses standardized functions for clock event configuration and registration.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is modifying the drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16209_trigger.c and drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16240_trigger.c files. The patch replaces the existing event handler functions adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll() and adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll() with the iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function.

The iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function is a generic function provided by the IIO (Industrial I/O) framework for handling data ready triggers. It is a recommended approach for handling data ready triggers in IIO drivers.

Considering this information, it seems that the patch is improving the code by using a standardized function for handling data ready triggers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the variable "npend" is not initialized in the function "ath9k_has_tx_pending" in the file "drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/main.c". This uninitialized variable can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential bugs.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

3. Patch quality: The patch itself initializes the "npend" variable to zero, which resolves the warning message. It is a simple and straightforward fix that addresses the issue directly.

Based on these considerations, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential bug and improves the reliability of the ath9k driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called `calibration_delay_done()`. This function is intended to be used by architectures to stop accepting registrations for new timer-based delay functions.

2. The function is marked as weak, which means it can be overridden by architecture-specific implementations if needed.

3. The patch also includes a dummy implementation of the `calibration_delay_done()` function, which does nothing. This allows architectures to use this function without requiring an immediate implementation.

4. The `calibration_delay_done()` function is called at the end of the `calibrate_delay()` function, indicating that the calibration process is complete.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and an Acked-by from Russell King, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant parties.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable addition to the Linux kernel. It provides a mechanism for architectures to signal the completion of delay calibration and stop accepting new timer registrations.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the superfluous address-of ('&') operators. This change is correct because the variables being assigned to are already pointers, so there is no need for the address-of operator.

2. The patch removes unneeded casts and replaces them with the %p format specifier to format pointers. This change is also correct because using %p is the recommended way to format pointers in the kernel.

3. The patch updates the initialization of the init_mm structure by removing the casts from the assignments of _stext, _etext, and _edata. This change is correct because these variables are already of type unsigned long, so the casts are unnecessary.

4. The patch updates the printk statement to use %p format specifier for pointers instead of %06x. This change is correct because %p is the correct format specifier for pointers, and it improves code readability.

Overall, the patch makes the code cleaner and more aligned with the recommended coding style for the Linux kernel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is modifying the `ioctl` function call to `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. The patch suggests that the driver does its own locking, so there is no need to use `ioctl` instead of `unlocked_ioctl`.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is recommended because the driver-core now supports synchronous self-deletion of attributes, and the asynchronous removal mechanism is scheduled for removal. Using `device_remove_file_self()` makes the "delete" behavior synchronous, which is desired.

2. The patch removes the `sdev_store_delete_callback()` function, which was previously used as a callback for `device_schedule_callback()`. This function is no longer needed with the new approach.

3. The `sdev_store_delete()` function is modified to use `device_remove_file_self()` instead of `device_schedule_callback()`. If `device_remove_file_self()` is successful, it proceeds to call `scsi_remove_device()` to remove the SCSI device.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary callback functions and replaces the asynchronous removal mechanism with a synchronous one. This change aligns with the direction of the driver-core and improves the behavior of the "delete" operation.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to recursive recovery during boot in the wlcore driver.

2. The problem occurs when a new recovery is queued during boot, and the recovery work tries to stop an already stopped hardware, potentially leading to a kernel panic.

3. The patch fixes this issue by verifying that wl->state is on before queuing a new recovery. If wl->state is not on, the recovery work is not queued.

4. By setting wl->state to WLCORE_STATE_RESTARTING and setting the WL1271_FLAG_RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS flag, the patch ensures that the recovery work is only queued when necessary.

5. The patch also disables interrupts using wlcore_disable_interrupts_nosync() before queuing the recovery work, ensuring proper synchronization.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone peer review and testing.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue described. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure in the `dce_v10_0.c` file of the AMDGPU driver. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` status of the DCE (Display Core Engine) IP block accordingly.

2. The `dce_v10_0_soft_reset` function is modified to check if the DCE IP block is hung before performing a soft reset. If the IP block is not hung, the function returns without performing the reset.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the wacom_raw_event function in the hid-wacom.c file. The purpose of the patch is to move the check for the Graphire report header to a more appropriate location. The current check is only valid for Wacom Graphire devices, as their reports always start with 0x03. However, the Intuos4 WL high-speed reports begin with 0x04, so the check would incorrectly filter out valid reports.

The patch adds an additional condition to the check for the USB_DEVICE_ID_WACOM_GRAPHIRE_BLUETOOTH product. If the data[0] value is not 0x03, it logs an error message and returns 0, indicating an unknown report. Otherwise, it calls the wacom_gr_parse_report function.

This change ensures that valid reports for the Intuos4 WL high-speed devices are not filtered out and that an appropriate error message is logged for unknown reports.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Ping Cheng <pingc@wacom.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a Wacom developer.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the positive review, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch modifies three files: `ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`. In each file, there are two occurrences of the same pattern:

```
nla_put_failure:
    ...
    if (unlikely(...)) {
        ...
        return -EMSGSIZE;
    }
    ipset_nest_end(skb, ...);
    return 0;
}
```

The patch removes the unnecessary call to `ipset_nest_end()` before the `return 0` statement in each occurrence. This change avoids calling `ipset_nest_end()` needlessly in the error path, improving code efficiency.

The patch also includes the `Suggested-by` and `Signed-off-by` tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that eliminates unnecessary function calls in the error path. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro in three different places in the code. This change prevents the kernel from crashing unnecessarily when certain unexpected events or implementation errors occur.

2. The use of WARN() instead of BUG() indicates that the conditions being checked are not fatal and do not require the kernel to crash. WARN() generates a warning message but allows the kernel to continue running.

3. The warning messages provide useful information about the unexpected events or implementation errors that were encountered. This can help developers identify and fix the underlying issues.

4. The patch also includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

2. The patch is signed-off by Andy Grover <agrover@redhat.com> and Nicholas Bellinger <nab@linux-iscsi.org>, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. In the code changes, the line `char buf[16];` is replaced with `char buf[] = "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1";`. This change initializes the `buf` array with the desired configuration parameters for the nullio device.

4. The line `memset(buf, 0, 16);` and `sprintf(buf, "rd_pages=8");` are removed, as they are no longer needed with the new initialization of `buf`.

5. The `hba->transport->set_configfs_dev_params(dev, buf, sizeof(buf));` line sets the configuration parameters for the nullio device.

6. Finally, the function `target_configure_device(dev);` is called to configure the device.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary change to make virtual_lun0 a nullio device. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the enqueue_task function calls in multiple places. The patch author states that ENQUEUE_RESTORE should always have ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK because DEQUEUE_SAVE will have done an update_rq_clock().

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The addition of the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag ensures that the enqueue_task function is called correctly, maintaining the integrity of the scheduling mechanism.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver instead of platform-specific clock names. This allows the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi and Roger Quadros.

In the code changes, the patch first attempts to get the "wkupclk" clock using the generic name. If it fails, it falls back to the old name "usb_phy_cm_clk32k" and emits a warning. Similarly, it tries to get the "refclk" using the generic name and falls back to the old name "usb_otg_ss_refclk960m" if it fails, also emitting a warning.

The patch handles both cases where the generic clock names are available and where the old clock names are used. It prepares the clocks accordingly and adds the USB PHY device.

Overall, the patch improves the driver's flexibility by using generic clock names and provides a mechanism for specifying platform-specific clock names through the device tree. It also handles backward compatibility with the old clock names and emits warnings for developers to update the device tree accordingly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new callback function called `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio_chip` structure in the `gpio-pca953x.c` driver. This callback is used to retrieve the direction of a GPIO pin.

2. The implementation of `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` reads the register value corresponding to the GPIO pin's direction using the `pca953x_read_single()` function. It then checks the bit corresponding to the GPIO pin in the register value and returns the direction (input or output) accordingly.

3. The patch also updates the `gpio_chip` structure initialization in the `pca953x_setup_gpio()` function to assign the new `gc->get_direction` callback to `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()`.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by two maintainers, Andy Shevchenko and Linus Walleij, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid addition to the `gpio-pca953x.c` driver, providing the long-awaited `->get_direction()` functionality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses build errors on device drivers with tristate Kconfig options when using custom initcall levels. Instead of adding ifdeffery into the drivers, the patch adds the missing initcall_sync variants. This fix is necessary to ensure proper functionality and compatibility.

2. The patch also updates the comment in init.h to clarify the valid use cases for custom initcall levels. It mentions that while most drivers should use regular module_init, there are still valid cases where custom initcall levels are needed. This clarification helps developers understand when and how to use custom initcall levels correctly.

3. The patch includes signed-off-by tags from Tony Lindgren, Arnd Bergmann, and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or alter existing behavior. They only provide necessary fixes and clarifications.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the build errors and improve the understanding of custom initcall levels.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements to the code. WARN_ON is a macro that generates a warning message if the given condition is true. In this case, the conditions being checked are related to the hardware compatibility of the Intel graphics driver (i915) with specific CPU types.

2. The first WARN_ON statement checks if the LynxPoint PCH (Platform Controller Hub) is found without a Haswell CPU. If this condition is true, it indicates a potential hardware mismatch or an unsupported configuration.

3. The second WARN_ON statement checks if the LynxPoint LP PCH is found without an Ultrabook (ULT) CPU. Again, this condition being true suggests a potential hardware mismatch or an unsupported configuration.

4. By adding these WARN_ON statements, the patch helps to identify and warn about potential issues during runtime. This can be useful for debugging and preventing unexpected behavior or system crashes.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only adds warning checks to improve the reliability of the code.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the codebase and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the conditional logic in the visornic_init() function in the visornic_main.c file. The original code checks if the visorbus_register_visor_driver() function returns a success code, and if so, it returns 0. Otherwise, it proceeds to the cleanup_debugfs label.

The patch changes the logic to check if the visorbus_register_visor_driver() function returns an error code. If it does, it jumps to the cleanup_debugfs label. Otherwise, it continues execution and returns 0.

This change ensures that the visornic_init() function handles errors correctly. If the visorbus_register_visor_driver() function fails, it will clean up the debugfs directory before returning an error code.

Overall, this patch improves the error handling in the visornic_init() function, making it more robust. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests replacing the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err` in the `cpsw_probe_dt` function of the `cpsw.c` file. The `pr_err` function is used to print an error message to the kernel log, while `dev_err` is a more appropriate function to use in this context as it associates the error message with the device structure.

By using `dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Missing mdio platform device\n")`, the error message will be associated with the device structure `pdev->dev`, which provides more context and makes it easier to identify the source of the error.

Since this change improves the error reporting mechanism and does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues, it is safe to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

```
unsigned int chanspec = (mode == MODE_MULT_CHAN_UP)
				? cmd->chanlist[cmd->chanlist_len - 1]
				: cmd->chanlist[0];
```

to:

```
unsigned int chanspec = (mode == MODE_MULT_CHAN_UP) ?
				cmd->chanlist[cmd->chanlist_len - 1] :
				cmd->chanlist[0];
```

This change aligns with the desired coding style and improves readability.

In the second change, the line is modified from:

```
s->range_table	= board->is_labpc1200
				? &range_labpc_1200_ai : &range_labpc_plus_ai;
```

to:

```
s->range_table	= board->is_labpc1200 ?
			  &range_labpc_1200_ai : &range_labpc_plus_ai;
```

Again, this change aligns with the desired coding style and improves consistency.

false || Based on the provided information, the patch removes the call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The reason for this change is that the IRQ is allocated using `devm_request_irq`. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Is the removal of `free_irq` justified? If the IRQ is indeed allocated using `devm_request_irq`, then it is not necessary to explicitly free the IRQ using `free_irq`. This is because `devm_request_irq` automatically handles the freeing of the IRQ when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded. If this is the case, then the removal of `free_irq` is justified.

2. Does the patch introduce any new issues or regressions? Removing `free_irq` could potentially introduce issues if there are other parts of the code that rely on `free_irq` being called explicitly. It is important to ensure that the removal of `free_irq` does not cause any unintended side effects or break any existing functionality.

3. Is the patch well-tested and reviewed? It is important to consider the quality of the patch and whether it has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers and developers. A well-tested and reviewed patch is more likely to be accepted into the stable releases.

Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis and review of the patch is necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with wrong checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The problem lies in comparing the obtained value directly with the target value, which doesn't work as expected. 

The patch introduces a fix by properly shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value. It retrieves the power state using AC_VERB_GET_POWER_STATE, shifts the value by 4 bits to the right, and applies a bitmask to extract the relevant bits. Then, it compares the modified state with the target value to determine if an update is needed.

The changes are applied to two functions: update_power_state and update_conv_power_state. In both cases, the same fix is implemented to correctly check the power state before performing any updates.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a proper fix. It doesn't introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix and improvement for the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements a rate_update hook in the rate scaling (rs) module of the iwlwifi driver. It re-initializes the rate scaling when a rate_update hook is called, which occurs when a remote STA changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

The patch also introduces a new function, rs_rate_update, which is called when a rate update occurs. This function stops any ongoing aggregations and re-initializes the rate scaling for the affected station.

Considering the nature of the patch and its purpose of fixing and improving the rate scaling functionality, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and enhances the stability and performance of the iwlwifi driver.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a valid improvement. The patch removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma" in the "vb2_vmalloc_put_userptr" function. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by multiple developers.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality from the code. The comment in the patch states that the SYSRESET bits in the HDMI PLL do not actually reset the PLL itself but only affect the power used for the PLL. Since there is no reason to use the SYSRESET bits and they are not used in other PLLs, the patch suggests removing the HDMI PLL reset to simplify the code and make it similar to other PLLs.

The patch removes the `hdmi_pll_reset` function, which was responsible for resetting the PLL using the SYSRESET bits. The function is no longer called in the `hdmi_pll_enable` function, indicating that the reset functionality is no longer needed.

Based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to remove the HDMI PLL reset functionality if it is not necessary and not used in other PLLs. This change simplifies the code and makes it consistent with other PLLs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a filesystem operation.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. The `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function is a variant of `lookup_one_len()` that performs the lookup without acquiring the parent directory's inode lock. This change is made to improve performance and reduce contention on the inode lock.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp`) than the original dentry (`dentry`). In this case, the comment explains that someone has renamed the dentry since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. The comment suggests that since the dentry has been looked up and connected, it will remain connected even after being renamed. Therefore, the function can simply release the `tmp` dentry and proceed to the `out_reconnected` label, indicating that the reconnection is successful.

Overall, the patch appears to be a performance improvement with a well-explained handling of a specific case. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for ARM architecture related to the vm_struct and ioremap mappings. The patch ensures that the phys_addr member of the vm_struct structure is filled in, allowing /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Considering the Acked-by tag from Nicolas Pitre and the Signed-off-by tag from Russell King, both respected members of the Linux kernel community, it indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces NULL values returned by `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it provides more specific error information.

2. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` when too many instances of the audio service are initialized. This is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in handling the error gracefully.

3. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)` when `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory. Again, this is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in proper error handling.

4. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EPERM)` when VCHI connections fail to open. This is another valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in distinguishing this specific error from other possible errors.

5. The patch replaces a NULL check with `IS_ERR(..)` where `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is called. This change ensures that the error pointer returned by `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is properly checked and handled.

Overall, the patch improves error handling in the `bcm2835-audio` driver, making it more robust and reliable. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver.

The specific change made by the patch is in the `device_create` function call. Previously, the parent device was set to `NULL`, but with the patch, it is set to `&cdev->dev`, which is the parent CCW device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is a bug fix or improvement to the s390/vmur driver. It ensures that the parent CCW device is correctly linked during the creation of the UR device.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch removes redundant code in the bnx2x_init_dev() function.
2. The redundant code sets the device power state to D0, which is already done by the Pci_enable_device() function.
3. The patch also removes redundant code for finding the power management capability of the PCI device, as the pci core has already saved this value.
4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Yuval Mintz from Broadcom.
5. The patch is signed-off by Yijing Wang and David S. Miller.

Overall, the patch removes redundant code and improves the efficiency of the bnx2x driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command. This option allows explicit enabling of CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. This addition enhances the functionality of the "perf record" tool.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "builtin-record.c" file to handle the new option. It adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the list of available options and sets the "record.opts.sample_cpu" flag accordingly.

3. The patch also modifies the "perf.h" file to include the "sample_cpu" flag in the "record_opts" structure.

4. Additionally, the patch modifies the "evsel.c" file to check if the "sample_cpu" flag is set or if the target has a CPU, and if so, it sets the "CPU" sample bit for the event selector.

Overall, the patch introduces a new option to explicitly enable CPU sample type in the "perf record" command, which can be useful for tools like c2c record. The changes are well-contained and do not seem to introduce any potential issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the `dm_thin_find_block()` function in the `dm-thin-metadata.c` file. The issue is that the `->fail_io` flag is checked outside the `metadata` device's `root_lock`, which can lead to a race condition with the setting of this flag.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for `pmd->fail_io` inside the `root_lock` section. If `pmd->fail_io` is true, the function returns `-EINVAL` and releases the `root_lock` before doing so.

This patch ensures that the `->fail_io` flag is properly synchronized with the `root_lock`, preventing any race conditions. Therefore, it improves the stability and reliability of the code.

Hence, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes are specific to the `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c` and `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/response_manager.c` files, which suggests that they are targeted and relevant to the specific driver in question.

Overall, the patch seems to improve error reporting and debugging capabilities in the liquidio driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the usage of the of_match_ptr() function in the tegra-usb driver's platform driver structure. The of_match_ptr() function is used to protect the data structure it operates on, but in this case, the data structure is always compiled in, making the usage of of_match_ptr() redundant.

By removing the of_match_ptr() function and directly assigning the tegra_usb_phy_id_table to the of_match_table field, the code becomes simpler and more straightforward.

The patch has been signed-off by Sachin Kamat and Felipe Balbi, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them. Additionally, Stephen Warren and the linux-tegra mailing list have been CC'd, suggesting that the patch has been shared with relevant stakeholders for their input.

5. The changes made in the ni_cdio_cmd() function correctly set the cdo_mode_bits variable using the NI_M_CDO_MODE_* defines.
6. The changes made in the ni_stc.h header file define the necessary macros for NI_M_CDO_MODE_REG, including data lane definitions and other control bits.

Overall, the patch improves code readability and uses proper kernel coding conventions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it is clear that the patch aims to constify the `of_device_id` arrays in three different drivers (`mxc_w1.c`, `omap_hdq.c`, and `w1-gpio.c`). The purpose of this change is to ensure that the `of_device_id` arrays are always used as const, which is a good practice.

Considering that `of_device_id` arrays are used as const in other parts of the kernel (e.g., `driver.of_match_table` and open firmware functions), it is reasonable to apply this change consistently across all drivers.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `whitelist` array in the `intel_uncore.c` file of the i915 driver. Specifically, it changes the `gen_bitmask` value for the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` entry from `GEN_RANGE(4, 8)` to `GEN_RANGE(4, 9)`.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function in the `drm/nouveau/abi16` module. This locked variant is necessary for providing limited interoperability in USIF.

2. The existing `nouveau_abi16_get()` function is made static and renamed to `nouveau_abi16()`.

3. The new `nouveau_abi16_get()` function takes a `drm_file` structure as an argument and acquires the client mutex lock before accessing the ABI16 data.

4. If the `nouveau_abi16()` function returns a non-NULL value, the `cli->abi16` pointer is returned. Otherwise, the client mutex is released, and NULL is returned.

5. The `nouveau_abi16_put()` function is not modified in this patch.

Overall, this patch introduces a necessary locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function, ensuring proper synchronization when accessing ABI16 data. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch modifies the "enable_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" to handle the new advertising setting. If the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set, the controller is switched to connectable mode. Otherwise, the existing "get_connectable" function is used to determine the connectable mode.

3. The "set_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" is also modified to handle the new advertising setting. If the "cp->val" (value) is 0x02, the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set. If it is 0x00 or 0x01, the flag is cleared. This allows setting the connectable mode independently of the advertising mode.

4. The patch ensures that the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is properly handled when toggling the advertising flag in the "set_advertising" function.

Overall, the patch adds a useful feature to the Bluetooth subsystem by allowing independent control of the connectable mode during advertising. It appears to be well-implemented and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

The patch modifies the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. The original minimum frequency was set to 110000000, and the patch changes it to 55000000.

   - The patch aims to improve the performance of the `search_memslots` function in the KVM subsystem by adding a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism.
   - It states that in typical guest boot workloads, only 2-3 memslots are extensively used, and the same memslot lookup operation is performed repeatedly.

2. Changes made by the patch:
   - The `struct kvm_memslots` is modified to include an additional `atomic_t` variable named `lru_slot`, which will store the index of the most recently used memslot.
   - The `search_memslots` function is updated to utilize the LRU cache:
     - It first checks if the requested guest frame number (gfn) falls within the range of the most recently used memslot. If so, it returns the memslot directly.
     - If not, it iterates through all memslots to find the appropriate one and updates the `lru_slot` with the index of the found memslot.

3. Benefits of the patch:
   - The patch claims to improve the average lookup time for the given workload from 46 to 28 cycles, which is approximately a 40% improvement.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is making a change in the rtl8192_pci_probe() function in the rtl_core.c file of the rtl8192e driver. It adds an error handling mechanism for the register_netdev() function call.

Previously, the register_netdev() function was called without checking its return value. The patch modifies this by adding an if statement to check the return value of register_netdev(). If the return value is non-zero (indicating an error), the code jumps to the err_free_irq label, which presumably handles the error and frees any allocated resources.

This change improves the robustness of the driver by properly handling errors during the registration of the network device. By returning -ENODEV in case of an error, it ensures that the driver behaves correctly when encountering registration failures.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable and necessary improvement to the driver code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces two helper functions, `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser`, for accessing the ITS BASERn register. These functions provide a convenient way to read and write the register value.

2. The `its_read_baser` function takes a pointer to the `its_node` structure and a pointer to the `its_baser` structure as arguments. It calculates the index of the `its_baser` structure within the `its_node` tables array and uses it to read the corresponding register value from the ITS base address.

3. The `its_write_baser` function takes the same arguments as `its_read_baser` along with the value to be written. It calculates the index of the `its_baser` structure and uses it to write the value to the corresponding register. It also updates the `val` field of the `its_baser` structure by calling `its_read_baser` after the write operation.

4. The patch modifies the `its_alloc_tables` function to use the new helper functions. Instead of directly accessing the register using `readq_relaxed` and `writeq_relaxed`, it now uses `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser` to read and write the register values.

5. The `its_alloc_tables` function iterates over the `its->tables` array and performs various operations on each `its_baser` structure. It reads the current register value using `its_read_baser` and performs calculations based on the value. It then writes the updated value using `its_write_baser` and reads it back using `its_read_baser` to verify the write operation.

6. The patch also removes the assignment of `val` to `its->tables[i].val` before the write operation and replaces it with a call to `its_write_baser_cache` to update the `val` field of the `its_baser` structure.

Overall, the patch introduces helper functions for accessing the ITS BASERn register and updates the code to use these functions. It improves code readability and maintainability. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch adds hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" (tag "vxd" / hwcap bit 2^12) and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" (tag "vxe" / hwcap bit 2^13). This addition provides valuable information about the vector facilities supported by the system.

2. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/elf.h` file to define the new hardware capability bits `HWCAP_S390_VXRS_BCD` and `HWCAP_S390_VXRS_EXT` for the respective vector facilities.

3. The `arch/s390/kernel/processor.c` file is updated to include the new hardware capability strings "vxd" and "vxe" in the `hwcap_str` array. This ensures that the capability strings are correctly displayed in /proc/cpuinfo.

4. The `arch/s390/kernel/setup.c` file is modified to set the `elf_hwcap` value based on the presence of the vector facilities. If the machine has the vector facilities, the `elf_hwcap` is updated accordingly, including the new capability bits `HWCAP_S390_VXRS_BCD` and `HWCAP_S390_VXRS_EXT` if the corresponding facilities are present.

Overall, this patch enhances the reporting of vector facilities in the /proc/cpuinfo file for s390 architecture. It provides valuable information to users and applications about the supported vector facilities. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function in the `ie6xx_wdt.c` file. The `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is currently annotated as `__devexit`, but it is called within the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function, which is not marked as `__devexit`.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Section mismatch: Section mismatches can lead to issues such as memory corruption or crashes. It is generally recommended to fix section mismatches to ensure proper code execution and maintain stability.

2. Impact: We need to assess the impact of the section mismatch on the functionality of the `ie6xx_wdt` watchdog driver. If the section mismatch does not affect the driver's functionality or stability, it may not be critical to include this patch in the stable release.

3. Code quality: We should also consider the overall code quality and adherence to coding standards in the patch. If the patch follows best practices and improves the maintainability of the code, it may be beneficial to include it in the stable release.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch is attempting to fix the section mismatch by removing the `__devexit` annotation from the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function. However, the patch does not address the section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function itself.

Considering these factors, I would recommend a (B) NAK for this patch. It does not fully address the section mismatch issue and may not have a significant impact on the stability or functionality of the `ie6xx_wdt` watchdog driver. Further improvements or modifications may be necessary before including it in the stable release.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove unused variables and the corresponding lines that assign values to these variables. This type of cleanup is generally considered safe and does not introduce any new functionality or changes to existing behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function. The argument is guaranteed to always be the current CPU, so it is unnecessary. This simplifies the function's signature.

2. The patch replaces the per_cpu_ptr() macro with this_cpu_ptr(). Since the argument is always the current CPU, this_cpu_ptr() is more appropriate and efficient.

3. The patch modifies the rcu_pending() function to have no arguments. It iterates over each rcu_state and checks if there are any pending RCU updates for the current CPU. If there are, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

4. The rcu_check_callbacks() function is modified to call rcu_pending() without any arguments, as the current CPU is always passed.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing an unnecessary argument and using a more appropriate macro. It does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of existing code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the mx51_clocks_init() function is being converted to a Device Tree (DT) call. This change is being made because the i.MX51 platform is becoming DT only. 

The patch removes the mx51_clocks_init() function and replaces it with a new mx51_clocks_init() function that takes a device node as an argument. The original mx51_clocks_init() function is then renamed to mx51_clocks_init_dt().

The mx51_clocks_init() function initializes clocks for the i.MX51 platform, while the mx51_clocks_init_dt() function is a wrapper that calls the mx51_clocks_init() function with default arguments.

The patch also adds a CLK_OF_DECLARE() macro to register the mx51_clocks_init() function as the clock provider for the "fsl,imx51-ccm" compatible device node.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It updates the code to support the DT-only i.MX51 platform and improves the overall maintainability of the codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the use of __devinitdata in the staging driver for rtl8187se. The reason for this removal is that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option, making __devinitdata no longer necessary.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of __devinitdata is justified, as it is no longer needed due to the removal of CONFIG_HOTPLUG. This change will help maintain compatibility and improve the stability of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is a simple optimization to avoid calling `platform_get_drvdata` twice in the `dw_shutdown` and `dw_suspend_noirq` functions of the `dw_dmac` driver. Instead, the `dw` variable is used to store the result of `platform_get_drvdata` and is then passed to `dw_dma_off` function.

Considering that this change does not introduce any new functionality or fix any known issues, it can be categorized as a code cleanup or optimization. As such, it is generally acceptable to include such changes in stable releases, as they improve code readability and maintainability without introducing any risk of regressions.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding SYS-DMAC clocks for the r8a7796 platform. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the condition `path > 0 || tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is being removed and replaced with `path > 0`. The patch also includes a reported-by tag and is signed-off by multiple contributors.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the changes made and their impact on the codebase.

In the original code, the condition `path > 0 || tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is used to check if either `path` is greater than 0 or `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false and sets the `csmi_status` accordingly.

However, the patch removes the `tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` condition, which suggests that it is an impossible condition. This implies that the original code might have contained a logical error or an oversight.

Considering this, it is likely that the patch is correct in removing the `tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` condition. It simplifies the code and removes an unnecessary check.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the PM runtime code is being enabled for specific R-Car Gen2 SoCs. The patch adds compatibility checks for r8a7792, r8a7793, and r8a7794 SoCs, and if the machine is compatible with any of these SoCs, the PM runtime code will be enabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

Additionally, it has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, which adds credibility to its acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to set the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer. This is done because the bus frequency is fixed to what is set in the device tree (DT).

2. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and the related code that sets the clock divider for each transfer.

3. The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is modified to accept the frequency as an argument and sets the clock divider accordingly.

4. The "meson_i2c_xfer" function no longer calls "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" since the clock divider is set in the probe function.

5. The "meson_i2c_probe" function reads the "clock-frequency" property from the device tree and assigns it to the "freq" variable. If the property is not found, it assigns the default frequency.

6. Finally, the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is called in the probe function to set the clock divider based on the frequency obtained from the device tree.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency of the i2c-meson driver by setting the clock divider only once during the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer. It also simplifies the code by removing the "frequency" member from the structure. Therefore, it is recommended to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch changes the log level of error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer object size validation failures from `dev_err` to `dev_dbg`. This means that these messages will no longer be printed as error messages but as debug messages instead.

2. The reason for this change is to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages by validating userspace parameters. By changing the log level to debug, these messages will only be printed if debug logging is enabled, reducing the potential log flooding.

3. The patch has been reviewed by Tomi Valkeinen, who is a maintainer of the drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/omap_fb.c file.

Overall, this patch seems reasonable as it improves the logging behavior and prevents potential log flooding. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static. This change is justified because the variable is only used in the scsi_debug.c file. Making it static limits its scope to the file, improving code organization and reducing the risk of unintended access or modification.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

3. The change is a simple modification that does not introduce any new functionality or alter existing behavior. It only modifies the storage class of the variable.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and beneficial change that improves code organization and reduces potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch is titled "KVM: VMX: Improve error reporting during invalid guest state emulation." It aims to enhance error reporting to userspace when instruction emulation fails.

In the code changes, the patch adds error reporting logic when the `err` variable is not equal to `EMULATE_DONE`. It sets the `exit_reason` field of the `vcpu->run` structure to `KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR` and the `suberror` field to `KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION`. Additionally, it sets the `ndata` field to 0. This ensures that the error is properly reported to userspace.

The patch also includes a check for pending signals before returning from the function, which is unrelated to the error reporting improvement.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM VMX subsystem. It provides a clear and concise solution without introducing any potential regressions or side effects. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` in the `net/ipv6/raw.c` file.
2. The patch changes the function signature to include a `struct msghdr *msg` parameter instead of using `void *from` and `int length` separately.
3. The patch updates the code to use `msg->msg_iter.iov` instead of `from` and `length` to copy data into the `iph` buffer.
4. The patch also updates the function call to `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` in the `rawv6_sendmsg()` function to pass the `msg` parameter instead of casting `msg->msg_iter.iov` to `struct iovec *`.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a correct and necessary change to improve the code. It simplifies the function signature and uses the `msg` parameter consistently throughout the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

4. The patch first calls the port driver's .set_termios method before setting or clearing the ASYNC_CTS_FLOW and ASYNC_CHECK_CD flags. This ensures that the termios settings are properly configured based on the available hardware support.

5. The patch also reloads the cflag from termios after calling uart_change_speed(). This is necessary because the port driver may have overridden the flags, and this step ensures that the correct cflag value is used.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the `qos_request` field from the `saa7134_fh` structure to the `saa7134_dev` structure. This change makes sense because `qos_request` is a global field and not specific to a file handle.

2. In the `saa7134_streamon` function, the patch updates the `pm_qos_add_request` call to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is added to the correct `qos_request` field.

3. Similarly, in the `saa7134_streamoff` function, the patch updates the `pm_qos_remove_request` call to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is removed from the correct `qos_request` field.

4. In the `saa7134_fh` structure, the `qos_request` field is removed since it is no longer needed.

5. In the `saa7134_dev` structure, the `qos_request` field is added to store the `qos_request` for the device.

Overall, the patch improves the code by correctly handling the `qos_request` field at the device level instead of the file handle level. This change ensures that the request is added and removed correctly, improving the stability and performance of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the scan_read_raw_oob() function in the nand_bbt.c file of the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem. The purpose of the patch is to handle ECC errors differently when scanning for simple bad block markers.

Previously, the function would return the result of mtd->read_oob() directly. However, with the patch, the return value is checked for -EUCLEAN or -EBADMSG, which indicate ECC errors. If the return value is one of these error codes, the function returns 0, effectively ignoring the ECC errors.

The same modification is made in the scan_block_fast() function, where the return value of mtd->read_oob() is also checked for ECC errors and ignored if present.

The rationale behind this change is that when scanning for simple bad block markers, ECC errors are not considered significant. The assumption is that the relevant markers are still non-0xFF for true bad blocks.

Overall, this patch seems reasonable and does not introduce any obvious issues. It addresses a specific scenario and improves the handling of ECC errors during bad block marker scanning. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is specific to the MIPS architecture, specifically the Sibyte platform.

2. The patch moves the bus watcher initialization from the deprecated __initcall to device_initcall.

3. The __initcall macro is used to mark functions that are only called during the kernel initialization phase and are not needed afterwards. However, it is deprecated and discouraged from use.

4. The device_initcall macro is used to register a function to be called during device initialization. This is the recommended way to initialize device-specific functionality.

5. The change does not modify any existing functionality but improves the code by using the recommended initialization method.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean and necessary improvement to the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch enables setting the minimum inline header mode for Virtual Functions (VFs) in the mlx5 driver.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to modify the minimum inline header mode for a specific VF.
   - The function takes the mlx5_core_dev structure, VF vport number, and the desired minimum inline value as input.
   - It constructs the necessary input parameters for the `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` function and calls it.
   - The `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` function is responsible for modifying the VF's NIC vport context with the new minimum inline value.

3. Impact and Justification:
   - This patch allows the PF (Physical Function) to set the minimum inline header mode for VFs.
   - The minimum inline header mode determines the minimum number of bytes that can be sent as inline data in a WQE (Work Queue Element).
   - By enabling this feature, the PF can control the minimum inline header mode for VFs, which can improve network performance and reduce latency.
   - This feature is useful in scenarios where the PF wants to optimize the network traffic for specific VFs.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It introduces a useful feature that allows the PF to set the minimum inline header mode for VFs, providing flexibility and potential performance improvements.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix the issue where the auto defragmentation process continues to run even when the file system is frozen.

2. The patch adds two new lines of code to the existing codebase. The first line, `sb_start_write(fs_info->sb)`, acquires a write lock on the superblock, and the second line, `sb_end_write(fs_info->sb)`, releases the write lock.

3. By acquiring the write lock on the superblock before running the auto defragmentation process and releasing it afterward, the patch ensures that the auto defragmentation process does not run when the file system is frozen.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes the issue of auto defragmentation running during file system freeze.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch sets the suspend_bias_off flag to true in the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures. This change replaces the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the suspend function. By using the suspend_bias_off flag, the code becomes shorter and cleaner.

3. The patch removes the suspend function adau17x1_suspend from the adau17x1 CODEC driver. Instead, it directly sets the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the resume function. This change simplifies the code and eliminates the need for a separate suspend function.

4. The patch also removes the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in the resume function. This is because the suspend_bias_off flag is set to true, which automatically sets the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY during resume.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves code organization and readability.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean-up and code improvement, without any negative impact on functionality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes are adjusting the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. The purpose of these changes is to improve the encoded output using the default settings.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The changes seem to be beneficial and aim to enhance the performance of the driver. However, it is important to note that further testing and verification should be conducted to ensure that the changes do not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` and `.bus` fields for the `b53_spi_driver` structure in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver. The reason for this removal is that the `module_spi_driver()` function is used, which automatically sets these fields.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of these fields is justified since they are redundant and can be automatically set by the `module_spi_driver()` function. Removing redundant code can help improve code readability and maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix to use the correct format specifier for the size_t type in the debug and warning messages.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the changes it introduces.

The patch modifies the nva3_ram_ctor function in the drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/subdev/fb/ramnva3.c file. It updates the initialization of several register values used by the RAM controller. Specifically, it changes the initialization of three registers (0x100760, 0x1007a0, and 0x1110e0) to use the ramfuc_stride function instead of the ramfuc_reg function. The ramfuc_stride function takes an additional argument, ram->base.part_mask, which is a partition mask.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The changes appear to be a valid improvement to the nva3_ram_ctor function, introducing the use of the ramfuc_stride function to handle register initialization with partition-specific stride values. This change could potentially improve the performance or functionality of the RAM controller in the nva3 driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event`. This change is made because the name `pga_event` was misleading. Renaming the function improves code clarity and maintainability.

2. The `pga_event` function is used as an event handler for the OUT_DRV widgets. The patch updates the function name in the code to reflect its purpose accurately.

3. The patch removes the `mute` variable from the `struct twl6040_output`. However, since this change is not related to the function name update, it is not relevant to the decision of accepting or rejecting the patch.

4. The patch updates the widget definitions in the `twl6040_dapm_widgets` array to use the renamed `out_drv_event` function as the event handler for the respective widgets. This ensures consistency and clarity in the code.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity by renaming the function and updating the widget definitions accordingly. It does not introduce any new functionality or significant changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch is titled "ASoC: max98090: read micbias from device property."
   - It mentions that the patch reads max98090 micbias from ACPI or device tree (DT).

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Fang, Yang A <yang.a.fang@intel.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>.
   - Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/max98090.txt is also mentioned as a sign-off.

3. Patch Details:
   - The patch adds a new optional property called "maxim,micbias" to the max98090 codec driver.
   - The property specifies the micbias voltage for the analog mic.
   - The valid voltage values are 0 (2.2v), 1 (2.55v), 2 (2.4v), and 3 (2.8v).

4. Code Changes:
   - In the max98090_probe() function of max98090.c, the patch adds code to read the "maxim,micbias" property value.
   - If the property is not found, it sets the micbias voltage to the default value of 2.8v and prints an info message.
   - If the property value is out of range, it sets the micbias voltage to the default value of 2.8v and prints an error message.
   - Finally, it updates the micbias voltage using the snd_soc_update_bits() function.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a useful feature by allowing the micbias voltage to be specified through device properties, providing flexibility for different hardware configurations. The patch also includes proper error handling and default value assignment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit in the patch_hdmi.c file of the sound/pci/hda directory. The regression caused incorrect assignment of the pin NID. The fix assigns the correct pin NID to spec->pins[0].pin_nid.

Given this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a reported issue and fixes a regression, ensuring correct pin NID assignment in the patch_hdmi.c file.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers: "dcssblk" and "xpram". The "owner" field is used to keep track of the module that owns the driver, but in this case, it is not necessary as the driver core will populate it automatically.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Removing the unnecessary assignment of the "owner" field simplifies the code and aligns with the standard practice of letting the driver core handle it.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture for the leon_callin() function. The warning indicates a mismatch between the __cpuinit and __init annotations for the leon_configure_cache_smp() function.

The patch modifies the declaration of leon_configure_cache_smp() to use the __cpuinit annotation instead of __init. This change ensures that the function is only called during CPU initialization and not during normal system operation.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a section mismatch warning and the correctness of the change, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue and improves the code's maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `ion_chunk_heap_create` function in the `ion_chunk_heap.c` file. It changes the log level from `pr_info` to `pr_debug` when printing the heap creation details.

The reason for this change is that success messages like heap creation should typically be logged at the `debug` level rather than the `info` level. Debug messages are intended for developers and can be helpful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes. On the other hand, `info` level messages are more suitable for general information or status updates.

By changing the log level to `pr_debug`, the patch ensures that the heap creation details will only be logged when debugging is enabled, reducing unnecessary noise in the kernel log for regular users.

Considering the patch's purpose of improving logging practices and maintaining a cleaner kernel log, it seems appropriate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of definitions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture.

3. Testing: The patch includes a "Tested-by" tag, indicating that it has been tested by Phil Schmitt. This provides some assurance that the patch has undergone testing and is less likely to introduce new bugs.

Based on these considerations, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the entire codebase and further testing may be necessary before merging the patch into the stable release.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes a redundant NULL check for the "brd" value in the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function. It states that the "brd" value cannot be NULL in this function because it was already checked for NULL as a parameter.

2. The dgnc_finalize_board_init() function is a static function called only from dgnc_found_board() function. The patch mentions that the brd->magic value is assigned once in dgnc_found_board(), so there is no need to check for DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value in dgnc_finalize_board_init().

3. The patch removes the check for brd->magic != DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC in dgnc_finalize_board_init().

Based on this analysis, the patch removes redundant code and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific issue and improves the functionality of the iwlwifi driver for 8000 series devices.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using the core function `irq_set_affinity` instead of a custom implementation for hotplug irq migration code. This change eliminates the need for an incomplete copy of `irq_set_affinity()`.

2. The patch also switches to using `for_each_active_irq()` instead of iterating through all IRQ descriptors. This change improves efficiency by only considering active IRQs.

3. The custom function `route_irq()` is removed as it is no longer needed.

4. The `migrate_irqs()` function is modified to use `irq_set_affinity()` directly instead of calling `route_irq()`. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

Overall, the patch improves the code by utilizing the core function and making it more efficient. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch updates the `imp_known_replied_xid` when trying to resend an already replied replay request. This is done because the xid of the replay request could be less than the current `imp_known_replied_xid`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific issue related to resending replay requests and ensures that the `imp_known_replied_xid` is updated correctly.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the udp err handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. In IPv4, when the machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will get an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

The patch adds a check for ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG and updates the PMTU (Path MTU) for the socket. Additionally, if the socket's PMTU discovery is not set to IPV6_PMTUDISC_DONT, it sets the harderr flag to 1. This ensures that the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

The patch also adds a check for NDISC_REDIRECT and performs the necessary actions.

Finally, the patch handles the case when np->recverr is true, and if harderr is true or the socket's state is TCP_ESTABLISHED, it calls the ipv6_icmp_error function to handle the ICMP error.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a discrepancy in behavior between IPv4 and IPv6 for UDP sockets. It ensures that the connected UDP socket in IPv6 will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket when an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message is received. This fix seems reasonable and necessary for consistency.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch sets the led_classdev max_brightness to the maximum level supported by hardware. This eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in brightness_set(). This change can improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary calculations.

2. The patch removes the bright_max variable, which is no longer needed since the max_brightness value is now directly assigned to led_dat->cdev.max_brightness.

3. The netxbig_led_set() function is modified to directly set the brightness value without performing any calculations. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

4. The create_netxbig_led() function assigns the template->bright_max value to led_dat->cdev.max_brightness, ensuring that the maximum brightness value is correctly initialized.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency and simplicity of the code by eliminating unnecessary calculations and directly assigning the maximum brightness value. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `libata-scsi.c` file in the `drivers/ata` directory. It updates the standard INQUIRY data for SCSI commands in the `ata_scsiop_inq_std` function.

The purpose of this patch is to avoid a performance bottleneck when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems (e.g., Windows) via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. The patch sets the CmdQue bit in the standard INQUIRY data to 1.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity and organization without introducing any known issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This prefix indicates that the function is only called from functions annotated with __init, which are executed during the kernel initialization phase. Adding the __init prefix allows the kernel to make use of this hint and potentially free up resources after its usage.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature. This helps in clarifying the purpose and visibility of the function.

3. The patch modifies the prandom_reseed() function to call the renamed __prandom_start_seed_timer() function instead of the original prandom_start_seed_timer(). This ensures consistency and avoids any potential confusion.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of existing code. It only improves the code by adding the __init prefix and renaming the function.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement without any known negative side effects. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are resource-managed functions provided by the kernel. This conversion helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

The devm_kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the adt7411_data structure. This function automatically frees the memory when the device is unregistered, eliminating the need for manual memory deallocation.

The error handling in the probe function has been improved. Instead of using a goto statement to jump to the exit_free label, the function now returns the error code directly. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

Similarly, in the remove function, the data structure is no longer freed explicitly using kfree. The memory will be automatically freed when the device is unregistered.

Overall, this patch improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of resource leaks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the use of `regmap_init_i2c()` with `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. This change makes the regmap initialization device-managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup.

2. The patch fixes a potential bug by adding a missing `regmap_exit` call. This ensures proper cleanup in case of errors.

3. The patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Sachin Kamat and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only improves the code by using a more appropriate function and fixing a potential bug.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

10. If the allocation is successful, it increments the vmlinux_path__nr_entries counter.
11. It constructs the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file using the kernel_version variable.
12. It duplicates the constructed path and assigns it to the new entry in the vmlinux_path array.
13. It checks if the duplication of the path is successful.
14. If the duplication is successful, it increments the vmlinux_path__nr_entries counter.
15. It constructs the path to the vmlinux file in the kernel build directory using the kernel_version variable.
16. It duplicates the constructed path and assigns it to the new entry in the vmlinux_path array.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks for the `moboard_uart0` function in `mach-mx31moboard.c`. These callbacks were responsible for initializing and cleaning up the UART0 device. The removal suggests that the initialization and cleanup are no longer necessary.

2. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is modified to remove the return type `int` and the `platform_device` argument. It now has the `__init` attribute, indicating that it is only called during initialization.

3. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function now directly checks the return value of `gpio_request()` and performs the necessary operations accordingly. If the request is successful, it sets the GPIO direction and frees the GPIO at the end.

4. The `uart0_pdata` structure in `mach-mx31moboard.c` no longer has the `init` and `exit` fields, as they are no longer used.

5. The `moboard_uart0_init()` function is called during the initialization of the `mx31moboard` device in the `mx31moboard_init()` function.

6. In `serial_imx_probe()` in `imx.c`, the `pdata->init()` callback is no longer called, as the `init` field is removed from the `imxuart_platform_data` structure.

7. The `uart_add_one_port()` function is called directly after the `pdata->init()` callback is removed.

8. The `serial_imx_remove()` function no longer calls `pdata->exit()` as the `exit` field is removed from the `imxuart_platform_data` structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch removes unnecessary initialization and cleanup code for the UART0 device. The changes do not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is intended to initialize the BBP_R103 register on various subroutines in the rt2800 driver. The patch adds code to set the value of BBP_R103 to 0xc0 in certain conditions and to 0x00 in other conditions.

2. The patch correctly updates the sizeimage field to be calculated as width * height * 3 / 2, which is the correct formula for YUV420 format.

3. The patch also updates the vidioc_s_fmt function to set the sizeimage field based on the value provided in the v4l2_format structure, rather than calculating it based on the format type.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and a tested-by tag.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a correct fix. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC. This change allows for better parameter handling and documentation.

2. The patch introduces a new module parameter named "tx_buffers" to set the number of transmit USB buffers. This provides flexibility for users to configure the driver according to their requirements.

3. The patch adds a check to ensure that the user does not set the "tx_buffers" parameter beyond the defined limits of the driver. This prevents any potential issues caused by invalid buffer configurations.

4. The patch modifies the "device_set_options" function to use the new "tx_buffers" parameter value when setting the number of transmit buffers. If the user-provided value is within the defined limits, it is used; otherwise, the default value is used.

1. The patch adds a helper function called `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0 immediately.

3. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device associated with the given `ifindex`.

4. If a valid network device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the master index of the device.

5. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index.

6. Additionally, the patch includes a duplicate definition of the `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` function with an empty implementation. This duplicate definition should be removed.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It adds a useful helper function for looking up the l3mdev master index, which can be beneficial for certain network-related operations. However, the duplicate definition of `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` should be removed before merging the patch.

This change improves code readability and efficiency. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author and a maintainer.

Therefore, considering the simplicity and correctness of the patch, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions in the i40e driver.
2. The patch updates the functions to take u16 instead of s16 as an argument, as they no longer expect to be called with VID=I40E_VLAN_ANY.
3. The patch adds a check in both functions to ensure that the VID is not zero (untagged) and that the VSI does not have a PVID set. If either condition is true, the functions return -EINVAL.
4. The patch removes the usage of i40e_vsi_kill_vlan and i40e_vsi_add_vlan functions when the PVID is set or when VID is less than 1.
5. The patch also updates the function declaration in the i40e.h header file.

2. Instead of using the macro, the patch introduces a local variable 'thisboard' and assigns it the value obtained from the 'comedi_board()' helper function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch improves code readability and eliminates reliance on a specific variable name, making the code more maintainable. Additionally, it uses the recommended 'comedi_board()' helper function to obtain the pointer, ensuring consistency with other parts of the codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new property called "phy-reset-duration" for device tree probe. This property allows boards to specify a longer reset duration for the phy if needed. This is a useful addition as different boards may require different reset durations.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the "phy-reset-duration" property is only used if the "phy-reset-gpios" property is available. This ensures that the reset duration is only applied when the phy reset GPIO is specified.

3. The patch also updates the "tusb_dma_controller_create" function to assign the "musb" pointer to the "musb" member of the "dma_controller" structure. This ensures that the "musb" pointer is properly initialized.

Overall, the patch cleans up the code by removing an unnecessary member and ensures that the correct "musb" pointer is used. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch makes the function `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. Making these functions static limits their visibility to only the file they are defined in, which can improve code encapsulation and reduce the risk of naming conflicts.

Since these functions are not used outside of the `dst_cache.c` file, making them static does not affect any external dependencies or functionality. It also helps to clarify that these functions are intended for internal use only.

Overall, this change improves code organization and maintainability without introducing any negative side effects. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the registration of a network device (netdev) before connecting the physical layer (phy).
2. The current implementation connects the phy before registering the netdev, which results in an info message with the name 'uninitialised' if the netdev has not been registered yet.
3. By registering the netdev first and then connecting the phy, this issue can be avoided.
4. The patch moves the call to `dsa_slave_phy_setup()` after the netdev registration to ensure that the phy is connected only after the netdev is registered.
5. The patch also handles the error case if `dsa_slave_phy_setup()` fails, printing an error message and freeing the netdev before returning the error code.
6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior, but it improves the order of operations to avoid the info message and handle errors correctly.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes a useless casting of the return value of kmalloc. In the original code, the return value of kmalloc is cast to `(unsigned long *)`, but it is assigned to `fb->desc_table.virtual`, which is already declared as `(unsigned long *)`. This casting is unnecessary and can be safely removed.

The change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only removes redundant code, making the code cleaner and more readable.

Since this patch is a simple code cleanup and does not affect the functionality or stability of the code, it can be considered safe to include in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host." It suggests that the patch handles the case where the host reduces the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.

2. The patch modifies the `netvsc.c` file. In the `negotiate_nvsp_ver` function, it sets the `mtu` value in the `init_packet` structure to the current MTU value of the network device plus the Ethernet header length (`ETH_HLEN`).

3. The patch also modifies the `netvsc_drv.c` file. In the `netvsc_change_mtu` function, it updates the `limit` value to `NETVSC_MTU - ETH_HLEN` if the `nvsp_version` is greater than or equal to `NVSP_PROTOCOL_VERSION_2`. It also adds a check to ensure that the MTU is not less than `ETH_DATA_LEN` (1500) or greater than the `limit` value.

4. Additionally, the patch modifies the `rndis_filter.c` file. In the `rndis_filter_device_add` function, it retrieves the MTU value from the host using the `rndis_filter_query_device` function and updates the MTU value of the network device accordingly.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) in Linux -stable releases. It addresses the scenario where the host reduces the MTU and ensures that the network device handles this new MTU value correctly.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address an issue with the sirf serial driver. It states that the fast lookup table to set the baud rate is only correct when ioclk is 150MHz, but some boards might set ioclk to a different frequency.

2. The patch proposes to recalculate the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz. Additionally, it retrieves the clk in the probe function and releases it in the remove function.

3. The patch modifies the sirfsoc_uart_set_termios function by removing the assignment of ioclk_rate to 150000000.

4. It adds a condition to the fast calculation of the clk_div_reg, which only applies when port->uartclk is equal to 150000000.

5. The patch modifies the calculation of clk_div_reg when the fast calculation does not apply.

6. In the probe function, the patch retrieves the clk and assigns it to sirfport->clk. It also enables the clk and sets port->uartclk to the rate of the clk.

7. In the remove function, the patch disables and unprepares the clk, and releases it.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific issue with the sirf serial driver and provides a solution that allows for correct baud rate calculation when ioclk is not 150MHz. Additionally, it properly handles the clk resource by retrieving, enabling, disabling, and releasing it in the probe and remove functions.

4. The patch updates the condition `num_drc_entries <= max_drc_entries` to use `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries) <= max_drc_entries` in the `prune_bucket` function, ensuring atomicity.

5. The patch updates the `nfsd_reply_cache_count` function to return the value of `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)` instead of acquiring and releasing a spinlock.

6. The patch updates the `nfsd_cache_search` function to use `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)` instead of `num_drc_entries` for comparison and assignment.

7. The patch updates the increment operation `++num_drc_entries` to use `atomic_inc(&num_drc_entries)`, ensuring atomicity.

8. The patch updates the `nfsd_reply_cache_stats_show` function to use `atomic_read(&num_drc_entries)` instead of `num_drc_entries` for printing the number of entries.

Overall, the patch replaces spinlocks with atomic operations, improving concurrency and eliminating potential race conditions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch exports the symbol `confirm_error_lock` using `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`. This allows other parts of the kernel to access and use this symbol.

2. The reason for exporting `confirm_error_lock` is to enable the use of `eeh_serialize_lock()` and `eeh_serialize_unlock()` functions in the PCI surprise hot remove path. These functions freeze the affected PE (PCIe Endpoint) to avoid races due to multiple error reports.

3. The patch is signed-off by two developers, Gavin Shan and Michael Ellerman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change is made in the `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c` file, which suggests that it is specific to the PowerPC architecture.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch splits the function media_graph_walk_next() into two separate functions: media_graph_walk_next() and media_graph_walk_iter(). This split is done to address the increasing complexity of media_graph_walk_next() and to improve code readability and maintainability.

2. The media_graph_walk_iter() function handles the iteration logic of the graph walk, while the media_graph_walk_next() function serves as an interface to retrieve the next entity in the graph walk.

3. The media_graph_walk_iter() function follows the link from the current entity to the next entity, checks if the link is enabled, and determines if the next entity has already been visited. If the link is enabled and the next entity has not been visited, the next entity is pushed onto the stack for further iteration.

4. The media_graph_walk_next() function uses the media_graph_walk_iter() function to iterate through the graph until no more entities on the current level can be found.

5. The patch improves code readability by separating the iteration logic from the interface function, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement to the media entity graph walk functionality. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch modifies the rb532_gpio_get() function in the rb532/gpio.c file. It changes the return statement from "return rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);" to "return !!rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);". This change clamps the return value to either 0 or 1 using the "!!" design pattern.

3. The change ensures that the return value of rb532_get_bit() is converted to a boolean value (0 or 1) before being returned. This clamping is necessary to comply with the requirement of returning only 0 or 1 as specified in the patch description.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Linus Walleij and Ralf Baechle, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary modification to ensure proper error handling in gpio_chip .get() calls. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch adds error handling for the clk_prepare_enable() function in the twl6040_power() function of the twl6040 driver in the mfd subsystem.

2. The patch checks the return value of clk_prepare_enable() and if it fails (returns a non-zero value), it sets the power_count variable to 0 and jumps to the "out" label, effectively propagating the error.

3. This error handling ensures that if clk_prepare_enable() fails, the driver will not proceed with enabling the clock and will clean up any previous power operations.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior of the code. It only adds error handling, which is a good practice for robustness.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

4. The patch includes comments and is signed-off by the authors and reviewed by Marcelo Tosatti.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It introduces a necessary check to avoid unnecessary KVM_REQ_MMU_RELOAD requests and improves the efficiency of the code.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()`. This function is responsible for disabling the ISA DMA controller and returning the residue, as described in `Documentation/DMA-ISA-LPC.txt`. This helper function improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch modifies the `disable_dma_on_even()` function to use the new `das16_isadma_disable()` function instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `get_dma_residue()`. This change makes the code more modular and reduces code duplication.

3. The `das16_interrupt()` function is modified to remove the unnecessary `claim_dma_lock()`, `clear_dma_ff()`, and `release_dma_lock()` calls. These calls are replaced with a single call to `disable_dma_on_even()`, which already handles the necessary locking and unlocking.

4. The `das16_alloc_dma()` function is modified to use `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of `disable_dma()` and `release_dma_lock()`. This change simplifies the code and ensures consistency.

The patch modifies the "struct netns_sysctl_ipv6" structure in "include/net/netns/ipv6.h" to include the new knobs. It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c" and "net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c". Additionally, it modifies the usage of these knobs in "net/ipv6/addrconf.c" and "net/ipv6/af_inet6.c".

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing new functionality and configuration options to the IPv6 subsystem. It does not appear to fix any bugs or address any stability issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code refactoring. The patch moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h` where most other core code is declared. This change is done to accommodate the addition of a second knob.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be categorized as a clean-up or organizational change. Such changes are generally accepted in stable releases as they improve code maintainability and readability without introducing any risks.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to auto-mute or auto-mic functionality when a jack is retasked as a different direction. It ensures that when a jack is retasked as an input or output, it is not counted as the target for automatic jack switching.

The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` function to skip the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is supposed. It checks if the pin is retasked as an input and continues to the next pin if it is. This prevents the pin from being detected as present.

Similarly, the patch modifies the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function to skip the detection of pins retasked as outputs. It checks if the pin is retasked as an output and continues to the next entry if it is. This ensures that only the appropriate pins are considered for auto-switching.

Overall, the patch improves the accuracy of auto-mute and auto-mic functionality by excluding retasked pins from the detection process. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is adding a missing cmpxchg64() function if CONFIG_RMW_INSNS=y. This suggests that the patch is addressing a bug or an issue related to the cmpxchg64() function.

2. The error message indicates that the cmpxchg64() function is not declared, which implies that it is missing in the code.

3. The patch maps cmpxchg64 to cmpxchg64_local, which is already mapped to __cmpxchg64_local_generic. This mapping ensures that the cmpxchg64() function is correctly defined and linked to the appropriate implementation.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the arch/m68k/include/asm/cmpxchg.h file, which is the relevant location for the cmpxchg64() function.

Considering these points, it appears that the patch is fixing a missing function declaration and correctly mapping it to the existing implementation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. It introduces a dynamic calculation of the address based on the presence of query registers, specifically query 6 and query 10.

The current implementation hardcodes the offset for query 8, assuming the presence of query 6 and query 10. However, if a touchpad does not report relative data, query 6 will not be present, and the address of query 8 will be one less. This patch calculates the location of query 8 dynamically, taking into account the presence of query 6.

By making this change, the patch ensures that the address of query 8 is correctly calculated regardless of the presence of query 6. This improves the reliability and compatibility of the HID RMI driver for touchpads.

The patch also includes proper error handling and logging in case the gesture information cannot be read, which enhances the robustness of the driver.

Overall, the patch seems to be well-implemented and addresses a specific issue in the HID RMI driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch moves the 64-bit feature fixup earlier in the code, specifically to the early_setup() function. This change ensures that the feature fixups are applied before turning on the MMU, which can have an impact on MMU management and interrupts. This aligns the behavior of 64-bit with what is already done for 32-bit.

2. The patch includes the necessary function call to apply_feature_fixups() in the early_setup() function. This ensures that all dynamic patching is applied at the appropriate time.

3. The patch removes the redundant call to apply_feature_fixups() in the setup_system() function. Since the feature fixups have already been applied in the early_setup() function, there is no need to apply them again in the setup_system() function.

Overall, the patch improves the order of operations and ensures that the feature fixups are applied at the correct time. It also removes redundant code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the zl10353_read_snr() function in the zl10353.c file, which is a driver for a DVB frontend device.

2. The purpose of the patch is to change the way SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is reported. Instead of using raw hardware register values, the patch suggests reporting SNR in a 0.1 dB scale.

3. The patch achieves this by modifying the calculation of the SNR value. It multiplies the raw SNR value (_snr) by 10 and divides it by 8, effectively converting it to a 0.1 dB scale.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues. However, it improves the reporting of SNR, which can be beneficial for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a reasonable and non-disruptive improvement to the zl10353 driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds more register documentation for the IRQC driver, including the definitions for various registers.

false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a "line over 80" issue in the comedi driver for the adv_pci1710 device. The change involves removing a comment and reformatting the code.

Since this patch only addresses a coding style issue and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for maintaining code readability or fixing build warnings/errors.

Therefore, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. The error is caused by the 'rspi_of_match' symbol being undeclared in the 'rspi_probe' function of the 'spi-rspi.c' file.

The patch adds a macro definition 'rspi_of_match' as NULL when CONFIG_OF is not set. This ensures that the build error is avoided by providing a default value for 'rspi_of_match' in the absence of CONFIG_OF.

Additionally, the patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, this patch is a straightforward fix for a build error and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store` function in the `toshiba-apci.c` file. The change is in the if condition that checks the value of the `mode` variable.

Before the patch, the condition was:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 && (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

After the patch, the condition becomes:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1  || (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

The change replaces the logical AND (`&&`) operator with a logical OR (`||`) operator. This means that the condition will now return true if either the `sscanf` function fails to read an integer from the `buf` string or if the `mode` variable is not equal to 2 or 1.

The original condition was incorrect because it would always evaluate to true. If `mode` is not equal to 2, it will be equal to 1, and vice versa. Therefore, the condition would never be false.

The patch fixes this issue by using the logical OR operator, which allows the condition to be true if either of the sub-conditions is true. This change ensures that the condition is correctly checking if `mode` is not equal to 2 or 1.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential bug in the code, and it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the use of the SPI_BPW_MASK macro in two different files: spi-bfin-v3.c and spi-ti-qspi.c. This macro is used to set the bits_per_word_mask field of the spi_master structure.

2. The bits_per_word_mask field is used to specify the supported bits per word values for the SPI controller. By using the SPI_BPW_MASK macro, the patch ensures that the correct mask is applied based on the desired bits per word values (32, 16, and 8).

3. The use of the SPI_BPW_MASK macro improves code readability and maintainability by abstracting the bit manipulation operations.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the existing code. It only improves the way the bits_per_word_mask field is set.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement that does not introduce any risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The added debug prints provide information about the vring being freed, including its index, size, virtual address, physical address, and context. This information can be helpful for debugging and analyzing the behavior of the driver.

4. The added debug prints are conditional based on whether the vring is for transmission (Tx) or reception (Rx). This allows for more specific and targeted debugging information.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable addition that enhances the debug capabilities of the wil6210 driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a clean-up and reorganization of variables related to the sdio layer in the brcm80211 driver. The patch moves the variables from dhd_linux.c to dhd_sdio.c for better organization.

Such patches are generally considered safe to include in stable releases as they improve code organization and maintainability without introducing any new risks.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of clk_enable/disable with clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare. This change is made to avoid common clk framework warnings.

2. The patch introduces error handling for clk_prepare_enable calls. If clk_prepare_enable fails, it will jump to the "out" label and disable/unprepare the previously enabled clocks before returning the error code.

3. In the atmel_usba_start function, the patch prepares and enables the udc->pclk and udc->hclk clocks before proceeding with the driver registration. If clk_prepare_enable fails for either clock, it will disable/unprepare the previously enabled clock and return the error code.

4. In the atmel_usba_stop function, the patch disables/unprepares the udc->hclk and udc->pclk clocks before unregistering the driver.

5. In the usba_udc_probe function, the patch prepares and enables the pclk clock before performing some initialization steps. If clk_prepare_enable fails, it will log an error message and abort the probe.

6. The patch also adds error handling for various failure scenarios in the usba_udc_probe function, including disabling/unpreparing the pclk clock before returning the error code.

Overall, the patch improves the handling of clock enable/disable operations by using clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare instead. It also adds proper error handling for clock operations, ensuring that clocks are disabled/unprepared in case of failure. These changes are beneficial for stability and avoiding potential issues with the common clk framework. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the use of __func__ from the dev_err logging in the gdm72xx staging driver. The purpose of this change is to clean up the log printout by removing unnecessary information about the specific instance of the device.

The patch is generated using Coccinelle, a program matching and transformation engine for C code. It replaces the __func__ argument in the dev_err function call with the variable 'y'.

The change is made in the gdm_sdio.c file, specifically in the send_sdio_pkt function. The dev_err calls within this function are modified to remove the __func__ argument and replace it with the variable 'y'.

The modified dev_err calls now print the error message without the specific function name, resulting in cleaner log output.

Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, assuming that the patch has undergone proper testing and is relevant to stable releases, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called `check_flush_dependency` which is responsible for checking the sanity of flush dependencies.
2. The `check_flush_dependency` function is called in two places: `flush_workqueue` and `start_flush_work`.
3. The purpose of the `check_flush_dependency` function is to verify that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items.
4. If the target workqueue does not have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set, the function triggers a warning using `WARN_ONCE`.
5. The warning messages indicate that flushing a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue while reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue without WQ_MEM_RECLAIM can lead to deadlock.
6. The patch ensures that the check is performed before flushing the workqueue in both `flush_workqueue` and `start_flush_work` functions.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to address a potential deadlock issue and provides a warning mechanism to prevent such situations. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

5. Acknowledgments: The patch has received acknowledgments from multiple individuals, including Jani Nikula, Cornel Panceac, Daniel Vetter, and Linus Torvalds. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by experts in the field.

Based on the above analysis, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the reported bug on the Intel D525MW mainboard.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `dump_cnt` function in the `turbostat.c` file of the `tools/power/x86/turbostat` directory. The purpose of the patch is to make the debugging output of `turbostat` less verbose by only printing the counters that are active.

The changes made in the patch introduce a series of `if` statements to check if each counter is active before printing its value. If a counter is not active (i.e., its corresponding field in the `struct counters` is zero), it is skipped and not printed.

This modification improves the readability of the debugging output by reducing unnecessary information. It also avoids printing zero values for inactive counters, which can be misleading.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable improvement to the `turbostat` tool, and it does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and has undergone proper review. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc in the ftgmac100 driver. This separation is necessary because the ftgmac100 hardware revision in certain devices no longer reserves all bits in RXDES#2 and instead uses the bottom 16 bits to store MAC frame metadata. This change helps avoid corruption.

2. The patch introduces a new member, `rx_pages`, in the `struct ftgmac100` to store the struct page pointers separately.

3. The `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page` function is modified to take an additional argument, `struct ftgmac100 *priv`, to access the `rx_pages` member.

4. The `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` function is also modified to take the `struct ftgmac100 *priv` argument for the same reason.

5. The `ftgmac100_rx_packet` function is updated to pass the `priv` argument to `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` when retrieving the page pointer.

6. The `ftgmac100_alloc_rx_page` and `ftgmac100_free_buffers` functions are modified to pass the `priv` argument to `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page` and `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page` respectively.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to the ftgmac100 driver and introduces necessary changes to ensure proper separation of rx page storage. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the attach option to disable DMA in the addi-data drivers.
2. The reason for removing this configuration option is that it is preventing the conversion of the addi-data drivers to the comedi auto attach mechanism.
3. The default action is to enable DMA if the driver supports it.
4. The patch removes the code that checks the option[2] value and sets the i_Dma variable accordingly.
5. The patch modifies the code to directly check this_board->i_Dma instead of the i_Dma variable.
6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. It is purely a code cleanup.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the attach option to disable DMA simplifies the code and aligns it with the default behavior of enabling DMA if supported.

1. The patch adds reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op in nfs4state.c.
2. It includes a FIXME comment suggesting that the atomic_inc operation should be moved into nfs4_preprocess_seqid_op.
3. The patch modifies the nfsd4_open_downgrade function by adding a goto statement to the put_stateid label instead of the out label in two error cases.
4. The patch also modifies the nfsd4_lock function by declaring an open_stp variable and adding a call to nfs4_put_stid for open_stp in the cleanup section.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds reference counting, which is necessary for proper handling of open stateids. Additionally, it includes some code improvements and fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward change to staticize local symbols in the `dcp.c` file of the crypto subsystem. The patch makes the `global_dev` variable static and also staticizes the `dcp_dma_unmap`, `dcp_dma_map`, and `dcp_watchdog` functions.

Considering that these symbols are only referenced within the `dcp.c` file, making them static is a good practice to limit their visibility and avoid potential symbol clashes with other parts of the kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the local variable 'status' from the function lancer_cmd_get_file_len() in the be_ethtool.c file. The function uses lancer_cmd_read_object() to get the current size of registers for ethtool registers dump. The returned status value is stored in the 'status' variable but is not checked. However, the check itself is not necessary as the 'data_read' output variable is initialized to 0. Therefore, the 'status' variable can be safely removed.

The patch has been signed-off by Ivan Vecera and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

3. The patch removes the unnecessary `spi_message` and `spi_message_add_tail` code, which simplifies the implementation.

4. The `spi_sync_transfer()` function is used with the appropriate parameters (`st->us` and `&xfer`) to perform the SPI transfer.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves the code by using a standard helper function.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that simplifies the code without introducing any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to turn off the voltage for thermistors by asking the MSIC (Multi-Source Interrupt Controller) to turn it off. This is expected to save power.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `mid_initialize_adc` function in the `intel_mid_thermal.c` file. It replaces the existing code that warns if the ADCTHERM is already set with new code that clears the MSIC_ADCTHERM_MASK bit and writes the updated value to the INTEL_MSIC_ADC1CNTL3 register.

3. Rationale: The patch addresses the issue of the voltage being turned on for thermistors by directly instructing the MSIC to turn it off. This approach is expected to be more efficient and save power. The code changes appear to be correct and do not introduce any obvious issues.

4. Sign-offs and Acknowledgments: The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Mika Westerberg, Kirill A. Shutemov, Alan Cox, Durgadoss R, and H. Peter Anvin. It also has an Acked-by from Matthew Garrett. These sign-offs and acknowledgments indicate that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the mpl3115 driver in the iio subsystem. It ensures that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads by using claim/release helper functions.

2. The patch adds the necessary locking mechanism to prevent conflicts when checking for direct mode and performing raw reads.

3. The patch handles different channel types (pressure and temperature) and returns the appropriate values based on the data read from the device.

4. It also handles error cases by returning the appropriate error codes and breaking out of the switch statement.

5. The patch includes the necessary sign-off tags from the authors.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-written and addresses a specific issue in the driver. It improves the reliability and correctness of the mpl3115 driver in the iio subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup error codes in hv.c." This suggests that it aims to improve error handling in the vmbus driver.

2. The patch includes changes to the `hv_post_message` function in `hv.c`. This function is responsible for posting a message to the Hyper-V host.

3. In the original code, if the payload size exceeds the maximum allowed size (`HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT`), the function returns -1. This is not a descriptive error code and does not provide any information about the error.

4. The patch replaces the return value of -1 with the `EMSGSIZE` error code. `EMSGSIZE` indicates that the message size is too large. This change provides a more meaningful error code, making it easier to understand and handle the error.

5. Additionally, the patch also handles the case where memory allocation fails (`kmalloc` returns NULL). In the original code, it returns -1, which again does not provide any specific information about the error. The patch changes the return value to `ENOMEM`, which indicates a memory allocation failure.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves error handling by using more descriptive error codes.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to error handling in the vmbus driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the potential problem of characters being dropped at close due to the missing implementation of chars_in_buffer in the sierra USB serial driver.

2. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from the author (Johan Hovold) and the maintainer (Greg Kroah-Hartman), indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The added function, sierra_chars_in_buffer, calculates the number of characters in the buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBs (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size. This ensures that the correct number of characters is reported.

4. The function is implemented correctly, using appropriate locking mechanisms (spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore) to protect shared data.

5. The added function is integrated into the existing sierra_device structure, ensuring that it is called when needed.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-written and addresses a specific issue in the sierra USB serial driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple change to the "rx51_aux_dev" structure in the "rx51.c" file of the ASoC (Audio for System on Chip) subsystem. The patch changes the visibility of the "rx51_aux_dev" structure from global to static.

In general, making variables static is a good practice as it limits their visibility to the current file, reducing the risk of unintended access or modification from other parts of the codebase. This can help improve code maintainability and reduce potential bugs.

Considering the nature of this patch and the fact that it does not introduce any functional changes, it seems safe to accept it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the efficiency of calculating averages in the cpuidle menu governor by using shifts instead of do_div when the divisor is a power of two. This optimization is expected to be beneficial in most cases.

2. The patch introduces a new macro, INTERVAL_SHIFT, which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the intervals. It is set to 3, which means INTERVALS is defined as (1UL << 3), resulting in 8 intervals.

3. In the get_typical_interval() function, the patch checks if the divisor is equal to INTERVALS. If true, it performs a right shift of avg and stddev by INTERVAL_SHIFT instead of using do_div. This optimization takes advantage of the fact that INTERVALS is a power of two.

4. If the divisor is not equal to INTERVALS, the patch falls back to using do_div for calculating avg and stddev.

Overall, the patch introduces a performance improvement by using shifts instead of do_div when the divisor is a power of two. It also maintains compatibility by falling back to do_div when necessary. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the arch/x86/kernel/uprobes.c file.
2. Currently, the function changes the task's state even if the ->pre_xol() hook fails. However, the comment suggests that the only ->pre_xol() hook cannot fail.
3. The patch addresses this issue by checking if the ->pre_xol() hook exists and returning the error if it fails. This ensures that the task's state is not changed in case of failure.
4. The patch also removes the redundant call to ->pre_xol() after changing the task's state, which further improves the code clarity.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue and improves the code logic. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. Instead of using 'ai_continuous', the patch suggests determining the value from the 'stop_src' member of the 'cmd' structure.
3. The patch also removes the usage of 'ai_continuous' in the code and replaces it with the appropriate condition based on 'stop_src'.

Reasoning:
1. The removal of 'ai_continuous' from the private data structure simplifies the code and reduces unnecessary duplication.
2. The suggested approach of determining 'ai_continuous' from 'stop_src' is more efficient and avoids potential inconsistencies.
3. The changes made by the patch do not introduce any new functionality or behavior. They only improve the existing code by removing redundant variables.

Therefore, the patch appears to be a clean and beneficial improvement to the codebase, and it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

4. The patch does not introduce any new code or functionality, but rather corrects the prototype to align with the implementation.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for maintaining consistency and ensuring proper handling of user-space pointers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new variable `ops` of type `const struct regulator_ops` and assigns it the value of `rdev->desc->ops`. This change allows for easier and more efficient access to the regulator operations structure.

2. The patch replaces all occurrences of `rdev->desc->ops` with the new `ops` variable. This change improves code readability and reduces redundancy.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only improves code organization and readability.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the `_regulator_do_set_voltage()` function, ensuring that the impact is limited to this specific area.

Overall, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement to the code. It does not introduce any potential issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch enables support for the standard "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property in the opal rtc driver.
2. The patch is adding support for the new property without removing or modifying any existing functionality.
3. The change is limited to the opal rtc driver, ensuring that it does not impact other parts of the kernel.
4. The patch includes proper attribution and sign-off from the relevant contributors.
5. The change is relatively small and does not introduce any significant risks or potential regressions.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is a reasonable and safe addition to the Linux kernel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code" and mentions fixing up the powergating logic. This suggests that the patch aims to improve the power management functionality for the AMDGPU driver.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Ack-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The code changes in the patch modify the ci_dpm_powergate_uvd() function in the ci_dpm.c file. The changes introduce conditional powergating of the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block based on the "gate" parameter.

4. When "gate" is true, the UVD block is stopped and powergated using the amdgpu_set_powergating_state() function. Then, the ci_update_uvd_dpm() function is called with the "gate" parameter.

5. When "gate" is false, the UVD block is un-gated using the amdgpu_set_powergating_state() function. Again, the ci_update_uvd_dpm() function is called with the "gate" parameter.

6. The changes appear to be focused on improving the power management behavior of the UVD block in the AMDGPU driver.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to address a specific issue and improve the power management functionality for the AMDGPU driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch is a renaming change in the staging driver for the rtl8192e wireless device. The function `rtl8192_phyConfigBB` is being renamed to `_rtl92e_phy_config_bb`. 

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a simple renaming change that does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes. Therefore, it can be considered a cosmetic change. 

In general, cosmetic changes like renaming functions are not typically accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for maintaining consistency or improving code readability. 

Considering this, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it may still be suitable for inclusion in the mainline kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch also has an Acked-by tag from Kishon Vijay Abraham I, who is a maintainer of the drivers/pci/host/pci-dra7xx.c file. This indicates that the changes have been reviewed and approved by the relevant maintainer.

4. The patch modifies the `dra7xx_pcie_probe()` function to use the renamed `dra7xx_add_pcie_port()` function instead of the original `add_pcie_port()` function.

Overall, the patch appears to be a simple renaming of a function to avoid namespace collisions and has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers and maintainers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a function `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon` directory. This function allows forcing a performance level via sysfs.

2. The function takes two parameters: `rdev` (a pointer to the `radeon_device` structure) and `level` (an enum representing the forced performance level).

3. Inside the function, it retrieves the current power state and performance level of the device.

4. Depending on the `level` parameter, the function sends messages to the SMC (System Management Controller) to set the forced and enabled performance levels accordingly.

5. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_HIGH`, it sets the enabled levels to 0 and the forced levels to 1.

6. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_LOW`, it sets the forced levels to 0 and the enabled levels to the maximum performance level count minus 1.

7. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_AUTO`, it sets both the forced and enabled levels to 0.

8. After setting the levels, it updates the `forced_level` field in the `radeon_device` structure.

9. The patch also adds a declaration of the `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` function in the `radeon_asic.c` and `radeon_asic.h` files.

2. The patch also includes the necessary changes in the "osd_client.c" file to encode the "flags" field when encoding the OSD request operation.

3. The changes made in this patch are related to encoding and sending the "flags" field over the wire, which ensures that the correct flags are set for the Ceph OSD operations.

4. The patch has been reviewed by multiple individuals, including Sage Weil and Alex Elder, which adds credibility to its correctness and suitability.

Based on the above analysis, it appears that the patch is a valid and necessary addition to ensure proper encoding and transmission of the op flags in Ceph OSD operations. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

6. The flags field of tx28_mmc0_pdata is set to SLOTF_4_BIT_CAPABLE, indicating that the mmc0 device supports 4-bit data transfer.

7. In the tx28_stk5v3_init function, the patch calls mx28_add_mxs_mmc to register the mmc0 device.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for the mmc-device on the mach-tx28 platform and includes necessary configuration data for the mmc0 device.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a section mismatch warning triggered by specific configurations (pnx8550-jbs_defconfig and pnx8550-stb810_defconfig). Section mismatches can lead to runtime issues and should be resolved.

2. The warning indicates that the function `prom_getcmdline()` references the variable `arcs_cmdline` in the wrong section. This can be fixed by adding the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function.

3. The patch correctly adds the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function, ensuring that it is placed in the correct section.

4. The patch is signed-off by Ralf Baechle, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the section mismatch warning and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for properly handling errors in the hv_acpi_init() function in the staging/hv/vmbus_drv.c file. 

The patch adds error handling code after calling vmbus_bus_init(irq) and registers the vmbus_acpi_driver if the initialization fails. This ensures that the driver is properly unregistered in case of an error.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a bug fix rather than an enhancement or new feature. Therefore, it is likely suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

My recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid addition to the Linux kernel. The patch adds a vifs list to the wl12xx driver, which keeps track of all the virtual interfaces associated with the hardware. This list will be used later for iterating through the vifs.

The patch includes changes in the `main.c` file of the `wl12xx` driver and the `wl12xx.h` header file. In `main.c`, the `wl12xx_init_vif_data` function initializes the `wlvif->list` using `INIT_LIST_HEAD`, and the `wl1271_op_add_interface` function adds the `wlvif` to the `wlvif_list` using `list_add`. Similarly, in the `__wl1271_op_remove_interface` function, the `wlvif` is removed from the `wlvif_list` using `list_del`. Finally, in the `wl1271_alloc_hw` function, the `wlvif_list` is initialized using `INIT_LIST_HEAD`.

The patch also adds a new macro `wl12xx_for_each_wlvif` in `wl12xx.h` for iterating through the `wlvif_list`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) to be included in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the OMAP4 clock data. This parameter is used to control the sddiv (spread spectrum divider) for the USB DPLL.

Since this patch is adding a necessary parameter to the existing code and does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues, it can be considered a bug fix or improvement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It deactivates an interface immediately on enumeration failure. This indicates that the patch is intended to fix a bug or improve the behavior of the system.

2. The patch includes error handling: It handles the case where the activation or enabling of the interface fails by properly logging an error message and taking appropriate actions.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality: It only modifies the existing code to handle failure cases correctly. This reduces the risk of introducing new bugs or regressions.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers: Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman have both reviewed and approved the patch. This indicates that the patch has undergone a thorough review process.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to improve the stability and reliability of the system.

2. The patch removes the bitwise NOT operation on the mask bits for WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_BCLK_MASK and WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_OPCLK_MASK, making the defines correspond to the bit defines in the datasheet.
3. The patch also removes the bitwise NOT operation on the mask bits for WM8900_LRC_MASK, aligning it with the bit defines in the datasheet.
4. The patch ensures consistent and correct usage of the mask defines, reducing the potential for errors.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the patch improves the clarity and correctness of the mask defines in the WM8900 codec driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the `ti_abb_init_table` function in the `ti-abb-regulator.c` file.

2. The patch replaces the hardcoded return value `-ENODEV` with the variable `num_entries`, which is the error value returned by the `of_property_count_u32_elems` function.

3. By propagating the error value returned by the function, the patch ensures that the specific error condition is properly communicated to the caller.

4. This change improves code clarity and maintainability by avoiding the use of hardcoded error codes.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that enhances error handling in the `ti_abb_init_table` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch removes the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function. It is mentioned that the driver never uses `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, so there is no need to set the data using `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`. 

Removing unnecessary code can improve code readability and maintainability. As there are no apparent negative consequences mentioned, it seems reasonable to accept this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the spin lock in the ramoops driver. Currently, the spin_lock_init() function is called before the kmalloc() function, which allocates memory for cxt->pstore.buf. If the memory allocation fails, there is no need to initialize the spin lock.

The patch moves the spin_lock_init() function call after the error checking for the memory allocation. This ensures that the spin lock is only initialized if the memory allocation is successful.

This change improves the code's robustness and avoids unnecessary initialization of the spin lock in case of a memory allocation failure. Therefore, it is a valid and beneficial modification to include in the Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential interactions or dependencies with other parts of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the log messages in the exynos_cpufreq_scale function to use the dev_err/info functions instead of pr_err/info. This change ensures that accurate log messages with the device name are displayed.

2. The patch adds a new member, "dev," to the exynos_dvfs_info structure. This member is used to store a reference to the device associated with the exynos_info structure.

3. The patch updates the error messages in the exynos_cpufreq_scale function to use the dev_err function with the dev member. This change ensures that the error messages include the device name.

4. The patch updates the error messages in the exynos_cpufreq_probe function to use the dev_err function with the pdev->dev member. This change ensures that the error messages include the device name.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing functionality. It only improves the logging mechanism by providing more accurate and informative error messages.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement to the codebase without introducing any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing a resource management issue related to clock handling.

2. The use of `devm_clk_get()` indicates that the clock resource is managed using the managed resource framework (`devm_*` functions). This framework automatically handles resource cleanup, which reduces the risk of resource leaks and simplifies error handling.

3. The patch is specific to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the Renesas R-Car platform. It modifies the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function to use `devm_clk_get()` instead of `clk_get()` when obtaining the clock for the SSI (Serial Sound Interface) device.

4. The patch also removes the call to `clk_put()` in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the clock resource is now managed by the managed resource framework, and manual cleanup is no longer necessary.

Overall, the patch appears to improve resource management and aligns with best practices for using the managed resource framework. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This indicates that these functions are not used outside of this file, which improves code organization and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.

2. The patch also addresses the warning messages related to missing prototypes for the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free`. By marking these functions as static, the warning messages are eliminated, ensuring cleaner code.

3. The patch includes the necessary sign-offs and review information, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch improves code organization and resolves warning messages, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the beginning of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the function is only executed when the interrupt mode is MSI-X enabled. If the interrupt mode is not MSI-X enabled, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code. This check helps prevent any issues that may arise when the interrupt mode is not compatible with the function.

2. The patch also optimizes the ring count validation by skipping the validation if the ring counts are not going to change. This optimization avoids unnecessary validation checks when the ring counts remain the same, improving the performance of the function.

3. The patch modifies the validation check for the receive (rx) and transmit (tx) ring counts. Instead of checking if the ring counts are non-zero, it now checks if the ring counts have changed from the current driver values. If the ring counts have changed, the `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function is called to validate the new ring counts. This change ensures that the validation is only performed when necessary, reducing unnecessary validation calls.

4. The patch removes the validation checks for RSS/TSS support in INT-x and MSI modes from the `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function. These checks are no longer needed as the interrupt mode check in `qlcnic_set_channels()` already ensures that the function is only executed in MSI-X mode. Removing these checks simplifies the code and avoids redundant error messages.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of ring count validations and removes redundant checks. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code cleanup that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages in the rtc-nuc900 driver. These messages are deemed unnecessary because they duplicate the generic OOM message from the MM (Memory Management) subsystem.

Given that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered a non-essential change. Therefore, it is more appropriate for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. 

Hence, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch includes three signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

3. The code changes start at line 3450 in the `be_main.c` file.

4. The first code change is the addition of a loop to determine the `ulp_num` (ULP number) based on the configuration value of each chute. It checks if the `ulp_num` is supported by the firmware configuration and breaks the loop when a supported `ulp_num` is found.

5. The next code change calculates the `page_offset` based on the `ulp_num` and other parameters.

6. The code change at line 3946 initializes the `ulp_icd_start` variable based on the `ulp_num` and the firmware configuration.

7. The code change at line 4013 adds another loop to determine the `ulp_num` based on the firmware configuration, similar to the previous loop.

8. The code change at line 4031 updates the `sgl_index` of `psgl_handle` based on the `ulp_icd_start` and `arr_index`.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch aims to enhance the jack connection decision logic for the nau8825 codec in the ASoC subsystem.

2. The patch introduces additional conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic.

3. The function `nau8825_is_jack_inserted` is modified to read the `NAU8825_REG_JACK_DET_CTRL` register and determine the jack polarity (active high or active low).

4. The `status` variable is used to read the `NAU8825_REG_I2C_DEVICE_ID` register, which contains the current status of the jack detection.

5. The `is_high` variable is set based on whether the `NAU8825_GPIO2JD1` bit is set in the `status` register.

6. The patch then compares the `active_high` and `is_high` variables to determine the jack connection status according to the jack insertion logic.

7. Finally, the `nau8825_restart_jack_detection` function is not modified in this patch.

Overall, the patch improves the jack connection decision logic by considering both active low and active high jack insertion logic. It does not introduce any potential issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix for the mc13892 regulator driver in the Linux kernel. The patch updates the regulator_ops structure for the mc13892_sw_regulator_ops to use the regulator_map_voltage_ascend function instead of the regulator_list_voltage_table function.

The regulator_map_voltage_ascend function is used to map voltage levels in an ascending order, which is suitable for the mc13892_sw1 and mc13892_sw voltage tables that have an ascending voltage list.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue in the regulator driver, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, it appears that the patch adds a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. The flag is used to only allow runtime PM for devices that explicitly indicate support for it. 

The patch modifies the sdhci_pci_fixes structure by adding a new boolean field called "allow_runtime_pm". This field is set to true for specific sdhci_pci_fixes instances, indicating that runtime PM is allowed for those devices. 

In the sdhci_pci_probe function, the patch checks if the chip's fixes field is not NULL, and if so, it sets the chip's quirks and allow_runtime_pm fields based on the fixes. This ensures that the allow_runtime_pm flag is correctly propagated to the chip.

In the sdhci_pci_probe function, the patch also calls sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow only if the chip's allow_runtime_pm field is true. This function allows runtime PM for the device.

In the sdhci_pci_remove function, the patch calls sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid only if the chip's allow_runtime_pm field is true. This function forbids runtime PM for the device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding support for runtime PM for specific devices in the sdhci-pci driver. As long as the changes are tested and verified to work correctly, it should be safe to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch adds support for handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring (VCS2) in addition to the first BSD ring (VCS1).
4. It checks if the master control interrupt flag for VCS1 or VCS2 is set in the master_ctl variable.
5. If the VCS1 or VCS2 interrupt flag is set, it reads the interrupt status from the corresponding GEN8_GT_IIR register.
6. If the interrupt status is non-zero, it handles the interrupt by notifying the corresponding ring (VCS or VCS2) using the notify_ring function.
7. Finally, it clears the interrupt status by writing back the read value to the GEN8_GT_IIR register.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a bug in handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue where the return variable of the function `request_code_segment()` is used uninitialized if the argument `boot_case` is false.

2. In the else block of the `request_code_segment()` function, the `write_blk_fifo()` function is called, and the return value is assigned to the `status` variable.

3. If `ft1000dev->usbboot` is equal to 0, the `ft1000_write_dpram16()` function is called with additional bitwise OR assignment to the `status` variable.

4. The `status` variable is then returned.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch correctly initializes and assigns the return value of the `write_blk_fifo()` and `ft1000_write_dpram16()` functions to the `status` variable. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before making a final decision.

2. The patch is signed-off by xiangxiao <xiaoxiang@xiaomi.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@linaro.org>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. In the code changes, at line 342, the initial jack status update is modified. Instead of immediately detecting the jack status using `snd_soc_jack_gpio_detect(&gpios[i])`, the patch introduces a delayed work scheduling using `schedule_delayed_work(&gpios[i].work, msecs_to_jiffies(gpios[i].debounce_time))`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch introduces a delay in the initial jack detection, allowing the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, indicating its credibility.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes the definition of pgprot_writecombine() for MIPS architecture. It addresses an issue where the generic code tries to provide a default implementation by defining pgprot_writecombine as pgprot_noncached, but the MIPS implementation is an inline function rather than a #define. This results in the MIPS implementation not being used.

To resolve this, the patch adds a #define statement for pgprot_writecombine to prevent the generic code from redefining it. This ensures that the MIPS implementation is used correctly.

The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors and has a reference to the patchwork for further review. Therefore, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the MIPS architecture and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch also includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` lines from the authors.

Considering the nature of the patch, which fixes a missing function call, and the fact that it has been reviewed and signed-off by the authors, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq()` in the `ltr501.c` file. The function was originally defined with an `unsigned int` return type, but it can potentially return a negative error code. To improve this implementation detail, the patch suggests changing the return type to `int`.

The change seems reasonable and aligns with the expected behavior of the function. By using a signed return type, it accurately reflects that the function can return negative error codes. This change improves code clarity and avoids potential confusion for developers using this function.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Peter Meerwald-Stadler, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer. This adds credibility to the patch.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Given that this patch only involves renaming functions and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be considered a non-functional change. Non-functional changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for maintaining consistency or improving code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) not to be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the `nes_reg_user_mr()` function.
2. The `ib_umem_release()` function is responsible for releasing the resources associated with an `ib_umem` object.
3. The patch ensures that if `ib_copy_from_udata()` fails, the `ib_umem_release()` function is called before returning an error.
4. This is consistent with the error-handling code in `nes_reg_user_mr()`, where `ib_umem_release()` is called in case of an error.
5. The patch also adds a call to `ib_umem_release()` before returning an error in the default case of the `switch` statement.
6. This ensures that the `ib_umem` object is properly released in all error scenarios.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is specific to the Blackfin architecture, as indicated by the file path "arch/blackfin/include/asm/dma.h". This means it will only affect systems using the Blackfin architecture, minimizing the risk of unintended consequences on other architectures.

2. The patch removes two lines of code that set the "curr_x_count" and "curr_y_count" registers to zero. These registers are related to the current count of DMA transfers in progress. However, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for removing these lines.

3. The patch adds the "dma_ch[channel].regs->cfg |= DMAEN;" line, which enables the DMA channel by setting the DMAEN flag in the "cfg" register. This change seems to be the main purpose of the patch.

4. The patch also includes an unrelated function "set_dma_callback" that sets a callback function for a DMA channel. This function is not modified by the patch and does not seem to be relevant to the changes made.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement for the Blackfin architecture, as it enables the DMA channel correctly. However, it would be helpful to have more information or justification for removing the lines that set the "curr_x_count" and "curr_y_count" registers to zero.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of a PCI ID for the Broxton SOC in the intel_th driver. This patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it adds support for a specific hardware platform.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing unnecessary calls to `usb_get_dev` and `usb_put_dev` in the `.probe` and `.disconnect` functions of the `usbnet:cdc-phonet` driver. 

The rationale behind this patch is that the reference count of the parent device (`usb_device`) is always held during the `.probe` and `.disconnect` of the `usb_interface` instance. Therefore, there is no need to explicitly increment and decrement the reference count using `usb_get_dev` and `usb_put_dev`.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It removes unnecessary code and does not introduce any potential issues or regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward removal of an unused macro definition, OZ_MAX_TIMER_POOL_SIZE. This macro is not used anywhere in the codebase, so removing it should not have any impact on the functionality of the code.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial change, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to clarify the variable names in the perf_evlist__strerror_mmap function and prepare it for further checks. It specifically addresses the scenario where the number of pages being attempted is below /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb, but the operation fails due to the user not having CAP_IPC_LOCK.

The changes made in the patch include renaming the variable "value" to "pages_max_per_user" to improve clarity. Additionally, the variable "pages_attempted" is introduced to calculate the number of pages attempted based on the mmap_len value.

The patch also updates the error message format to include the hints for troubleshooting. It now displays the current value of /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb, the attempted mmap length in kilobytes, and suggests trying a smaller -m/--mmap-pages value.

Overall, the changes in the patch are clear and improve the readability and understanding of the code. They also provide helpful hints for troubleshooting the specific error scenario. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug in the enic_change_mtu_work() function in the enic_main.c file of the enic driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds two calls to rtnl_unlock() in the error paths of the function.

The purpose of rtnl_unlock() is to release the rtnl_lock, which is a lock that protects the network namespace and routing tables. It is important to release this lock in error paths to avoid potential deadlocks or other issues.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue by properly releasing the rtnl_lock in error paths, ensuring correct behavior and avoiding any potential problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch ensures that two channels are clocked for I2S mode. This is necessary because I2S requires stereo clocking even for mono data.

2. The patch introduces a new variable `val` to store the value read from the ARIZONA_AIF_FORMAT register.

3. The patch checks if the number of channels in the parameters is 1 and if the ARIZONA_AIF1_FMT_MASK bit is set in `val`. If both conditions are true, it means that mono data is being used in I2S mode. In this case, the patch forces stereo mode by doubling the `bclk_target` value.

4. The patch then iterates through the available rates and selects the appropriate bclk_target based on the conditions.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue of ensuring stereo clocking for I2S mode when mono data is used. It introduces a necessary check and adjusts the bclk_target accordingly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "MIPS: BCM47XX: fix detection for some boards" and it aims to fix the detection of certain boards in the BCM47XX MIPS architecture.

The patch adds entries to the `bcm47xx_board_list_hardware_version` array, which contains the hardware versions of various boards. These entries include the board name and a corresponding identifier.

Additionally, the patch adds an entry to the `bcm47xx_board_list_board` array, which contains information about the boards, including the board name and various identifiers.

Based on the information provided, it appears that the patch adds missing entries for certain boards, such as "Asus RT-N10U" and "Netgear WNR3500L", to ensure their proper detection.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific issue and adds necessary entries for board detection, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and review by relevant maintainers, is typically conducted before accepting a patch into the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a valid fix for exporting I2C module alias information in the media staging driver for lirc. It adds the necessary MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to the driver code, which allows udev to auto load the correct module when the device is added.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch makes the function `register_disk()` static by adding the `static` keyword before its declaration. This change restricts the visibility of the function to the current translation unit, meaning it can only be accessed within the same source file.

The function `register_disk()` is defined in the `block/genhd.c` file and is used to register a disk with the kernel. Making it static ensures that it is not accessible from other source files, which can help improve code modularity and reduce the risk of unintended usage or conflicts.

Since the change does not modify the behavior or functionality of the function, it is a safe modification that improves code organization and encapsulation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a sparse warning in the `net/nfc/digital_technology.c` file. The patch suggests making the `digital_tg_send_sensf_res()` function static.

Considering that the patch fixes a sparse warning and does not introduce any new functionality or bug fixes, it can be considered a clean-up or maintenance patch. These types of patches are generally accepted in stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new debugfs entry called "amdgpu_gca_config" to the amdgpu_device.c file in the drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu directory. This entry allows reading GCA configuration data.

2. The patch includes some minor changes in subsequent versions (v2, v3, v4) to improve the code. These changes include using kmalloc instead of vmalloc, correcting indentation, and squashing in a kmalloc fix.

3. The new debugfs entry, amdgpu_debugfs_gca_config_read, reads GCA configuration data from the amdgpu_device structure and stores it in the config array.

4. The config array is then copied to the user buffer, buf, in chunks of 4 bytes until the requested size is reached or all configuration data is copied.

5. The patch also adds the amdgpu_debugfs_gca_config_fops structure to define the file operations for the new debugfs entry.

6. Finally, the new debugfs entry is added to the debugfs_regs array and debugfs_regs_names array, and the amdgpu_debugfs_regs_init function is updated to include the new entry.

Overall, this patch adds a useful debugfs entry to read GCA configuration data and includes necessary code changes and improvements. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug: Currently, v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() are only called when the last user closes the device and the device is already disconnected. However, these functions should be called whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users. The patch correctly moves the calls to these functions to the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function, ensuring they are called whenever the extension is closed.

2. The patch includes appropriate error handling: If the device is still open when em28xx_v4l2_fini() is called, a warning message is printed, indicating that memory deallocation is deferred until the last close. This ensures that resources are not leaked and provides proper error handling.

3. The patch removes unnecessary calls: The patch removes the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() from the em28xx_v4l2_close() function. Since these functions are now called in em28xx_v4l2_fini(), there is no need to duplicate the calls in em28xx_v4l2_close().

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and improves the code by correctly handling the closing of the em28xx-v4l extension. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for fast-xmit in the ath9k driver. Here is my analysis:

Such changes are generally acceptable in stable releases as they improve code readability and maintainability without introducing any risk of regression.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the "spi_master" driver fails to transfer one message from the queue when the "transfer_one" callback returns a positive value. The patch sets the return value ("ret") to 0 in this case and waits for the transfer completion.

The rationale behind this change is that a positive return value from "transfer_one" is not considered an error. However, without setting "ret" to 0, the code would hit an error when the "transfer_one" callback returns 1.

The patch seems to fix a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. It is a straightforward and minimal change that addresses the reported problem.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `__auxtrace_mmap__read` function in `tools/perf/util/auxtrace.c` and adds a new field `alignment` to the `struct auxtrace_record` in `tools/perf/util/auxtrace.h`.

The purpose of the patch is to allow auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size. This is necessary for certain cases, such as BTS (Branch Trace Store), where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

The patch introduces a check for `itr->alignment` and adjusts the length and size of the data accordingly. It subtracts the unwanted bytes from `len1` and `size` to ensure the alignment requirement is met.

This change ensures that the auxtrace data is properly aligned, which is crucial for certain use cases. It does not introduce any new functionality or behavior, but rather improves the existing functionality by allowing for different alignment requirements.

Given that the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of the code without introducing any known regressions, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch includes a reference to the Patchwork link, which provides additional information and discussion about the patch.

5. The patch is modifying the arch/mips/include/asm/mips-cm.h file, which suggests that it is specific to the MIPS architecture.

Overall, the patch appears to be adding necessary functionality and has the required approvals. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

2. The change modifies the function `dwc_dump_chan_regs` in the `dw_dmac.c` file. It marks the function as `inline`, which suggests that it is a small and frequently used function that can benefit from being inlined for performance reasons.

3. The change does not introduce any new functionality or alter the existing behavior of the function. It only adds the `inline` keyword to the function declaration.

4. The change is relatively small and isolated, reducing the risk of introducing new bugs or regressions.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial improvement to the `dw_dmac` driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is related to the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

2. The patch modifies the qla2x00_ga_nxt() function in the qla_gs.c file.

3. The patch adds a new assignment for the fc4_type field of the fc_port_t structure.

4. The fc4_type field is assigned based on the value of the third element (index 2) in the fc4_types array of the ct_rsp->rsp.ga_nxt structure.

5. If the third element of fc4_types array has its least significant bit (BIT_0) set, the fc4_type field is assigned FC4_TYPE_FCP_SCSI. Otherwise, it is assigned FC4_TYPE_OTHER.

6. The patch also checks the port_type field of ct_rsp->rsp.ga_nxt structure and sets the domain field of fcport->d_id.b to 0xf0 if the port_type is not NS_N_PORT_TYPE or NS_NL_PORT_TYPE.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds a necessary assignment for the fc4_type field, which improves the functionality of the qla2xxx SCSI driver. Additionally, the patch includes a minor check for the port_type field.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the file `net/ipv6/ip6_output.c` by replacing the `if (skb_copy_bits(skb, ptr, skb_transport_header(frag), len)) BUG();` statement with `BUG_ON(skb_copy_bits(skb, ptr, skb_transport_header(frag), len));`. 

The change replaces the explicit `if` statement with the `BUG_ON` macro, which is a more concise and idiomatic way of expressing the same logic. The `BUG_ON` macro is commonly used in the Linux kernel to indicate that a certain condition should never occur. If the condition evaluates to true, it triggers a kernel panic, providing valuable information for debugging purposes.

Since this change improves code readability and maintains the same functionality, it can be considered a safe and appropriate modification for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "[media] firewire: Deletion of an unnecessary check before the function call 'dvb_unregister_device'". It suggests removing an unnecessary check before calling the function "dvb_unregister_device".

The patch author, Markus Elfring, explains that the dvb_unregister_device() function already checks if its argument is NULL and returns immediately. Therefore, the additional check before the function call is redundant.

The patch has been reviewed by Stefan Richter and signed-off by Mauro Carvalho Chehab, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

The code change itself is straightforward. It removes the if statement that checks if fdtv->cadev is not NULL before calling dvb_unregister_device(fdtv->cadev). Instead, it directly calls dvb_unregister_device(fdtv->cadev).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `hfi1_query_qp` is being removed from the `qp.c` file in the `drivers/staging/rdma/hfi1` directory. The function is also being removed from the `qp.h` and `verbs.c` files.

The removal of `hfi1_query_qp` suggests that it is no longer needed or has been replaced by the `rvt_query_qp` function defined in `rdmavt`. This change is reviewed and signed-off by Dennis Dalessandro, Harish Chegondi, and Doug Ledford.

Considering the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the `hfi1_query_qp` function indicates that it is no longer necessary and can be replaced by the `rvt_query_qp` function, which should improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it is reset.

2. The problem occurs when the kernel reboots, and the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called.

3. In the current code, the buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler, even if the buffer is reset.

4. The patch modifies the code to check if the buffer is empty before updating the buffer tail. If the buffer is empty, the tail is not updated.

5. Additionally, the patch includes a check to wake up the UART write if there are fewer pending characters than a defined threshold (WAKEUP_CHARS).

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer after it is reset, and the modifications ensure that the buffer tail is not updated when the buffer is empty. The additional check for waking up the UART write also seems appropriate.

Please note that this recommendation is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may require further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem in the ARM i.MX5x platform.

2. It introduces four new clock gates: epit1_ipg_gate, epit1_hf_gate, epit2_ipg_gate, and epit2_hf_gate.

3. The patch registers the new clock gates using the imx_clk_gate2 function.

4. It also registers the new clock gates with clk_register_clkdev, associating them with the imx-epit devices.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding necessary support for EPIT to the clock subsystem in the ARM i.MX5x platform. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a bug in the Bluetooth module's update_scan_rsp_data() function. The function is supposed to operate on the scan_rsp_data_len and scan_rsp_data variables, but it mistakenly operates on the adv_data_len and adv_data variables instead.

The patch corrects this by updating the correct variables: hdev->scan_rsp_data_len and hdev->scan_rsp_data. It also updates the comparison condition to check if hdev->scan_rsp_data_len is equal to len and if the memory contents of cp.data and hdev->scan_rsp_data are the same.

The patch then copies the contents of cp.data to hdev->scan_rsp_data and updates hdev->scan_rsp_data_len with the correct length.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue and ensures that the correct variables are used for updating and comparing scan response data. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch converts the use of `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` in the `bond_debug_register` and `bond_debug_reregister` functions in `bond_debugfs.c`. This change ensures that the warning messages are logged using the appropriate network device logging mechanism.

2. The change from `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` is consistent with the existing codebase, as other parts of the bonding driver already use `netdev_warn` for logging warnings related to network devices.

3. The patch includes a comment stating that one occurrence of `pr_warn` is left intact because it is unrelated to the net_device. This indicates that the patch has been carefully reviewed and only modifies the relevant code.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including Veaceslav Falico, David S. Miller, Jay Vosburgh, and Andy Gospodarek. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has received approval from experienced developers.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is constifying the `exynos_drm_crtc_ops` structures in the `exynos5433_drm_decon.c` file. The purpose of this change is to declare these structures as const since they are only passed as an argument to the `exynos_drm_crtc_create` function, which expects a `const struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops *` argument.

The patch modifies the `decon_crtc_ops` structure declaration to be const:

```
-static struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops decon_crtc_ops = {
+static const struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops decon_crtc_ops = {
 	.enable			= decon_enable,
 	.disable		= decon_disable,
 	.enable_vblank		= decon_enable_vblank,
 	...
};
```

This change ensures that the `decon_crtc_ops` structure is treated as read-only and cannot be modified accidentally.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it is a constification, which is generally a safe and non-intrusive modification, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a precedence issue in the original code where the "+" operator has higher precedence than the "?:" operator. This caused the original statement to be equivalent to `entry->mask_pos = PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, which was not the intended behavior.

2. The patch correctly updates the code to handle the intended behavior. It checks if the `control` variable has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set. If it does, it sets `entry->mask_pos` to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`. Otherwise, it sets `entry->mask_pos` to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

3. The patch also includes proper attribution with the "Signed-off-by" tags from the authors who made the changes.

4. The change is a fix for a bug introduced in commit 78b5a310ce, as acknowledged by Bjorn Helgaas in the patch description.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to convert the usage of the `should_stop` variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API in the `virthba.c` file of the Unisys driver. 

The `kthread_should_stop()` API is used to check if a kernel thread should stop execution. It returns true if the thread should stop, indicating that it should break out of the loop and exit.

In the given patch, the usage of `kthread_should_stop()` has been added inside the loop, and the previous usage of `dc->threadinfo.should_stop` has been removed.

Considering this, it seems that the patch is correctly converting the usage of the `should_stop` variable to the `kthread_should_stop()` API, which is a recommended practice. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT (Device Tree) data for OMAP2+ devices. This is done to avoid the need to add most of the clock aliases under drivers/clk/ti/clk-xyz.c files.

2. The patch modifies the _add_clkdev() function in omap_device.c.

3. The patch first attempts to get the clock using clk_get_sys() with the provided clk_name. If it fails and the DT has been populated, it proceeds with the DT-based approach.

4. In the DT-based approach, it searches for the node with the given clk_name and retrieves the clock using of_clk_get_from_provider().

5. If the clock retrieval is successful, it registers the clock with clk_register_clkdev() using the provided clk_alias and the device name.

6. If the clock retrieval fails or the DT has not been populated, it falls back to the original approach of using clk_add_alias().

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch improves the creation of clock aliases for OMAP2+ devices by utilizing DT data, which reduces the need for manual additions in the clk-xyz.c files. This approach is more flexible and aligns with the use of DT in the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes the return value of the efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivarfs file system driver. Currently, the function returns a ssize_t type, which is a signed integer, but the variable "bytes" is of type size_t, which is an unsigned integer. Although both types should have the same number of bits, there is a potential for sign issues to be introduced.

To fix this issue, the patch initializes "bytes" as a ssize_t type and assigns it the value of "count" before any error conditions are checked. This ensures that the return value is consistent and avoids any potential sign issues.

Additionally, the patch updates the error handling code to assign the appropriate error values to "bytes" in case of errors during the copy_from_user() and validate_var() operations.

Finally, the patch sets "bytes" to the value of "count" before returning, ensuring that the correct number of bytes written is reported.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential sign issue and improves the error handling in the efivarfs_file_write() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a memory leak issue in the NVMe driver. Currently, if the adapter fails initialization, the memory allocated for the admin queue is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks and potential resource exhaustion.

To fix this issue, the patch introduces a new function called `nvme_free_queue_mem()` that frees the memory allocated for the admin queue. This function is then called in the case of initialization failure, ensuring that the memory is properly freed.

The patch also modifies the `nvme_free_queue()` function to call `nvme_free_queue_mem()` instead of directly freeing the memory. This change ensures that the memory is consistently freed in both cases.

Additionally, the patch handles the case where the initialization process is interrupted by a fatal signal or exceeds the timeout. In these cases, the `nvme_free_queue_mem()` function is called to free the memory before returning the appropriate error code.

Overall, the patch addresses a memory leak issue and ensures proper memory management in the NVMe driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a coding style warning related to void function return statements in the file `rtw_pwrctrl.c` of the `rtl8723au` staging driver. The patch removes the unnecessary return statement from the `rtw_ps_processor23a` function.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `xt_hashlimit.c` file in the netfilter subsystem. It introduces a new function called `rateinfo_init` and moves the initialization of the `rateinfo` structure to this helper function.

The motivation behind this change is to avoid bloating the main match function (`hashlimit_mt`) with additional code. By moving the initialization to a separate function, the main match function becomes cleaner and easier to read.

The `rateinfo_init` function initializes the `rateinfo` structure with appropriate values based on the configuration provided in `hinfo`. It sets the `prev` field to the current value of `jiffies`, calculates the `credit` and `cost` values using the `avg` and `burst` parameters from `hinfo`, and sets `credit_cap` to the same value as `credit`.

In the main match function, the patch replaces the previous initialization of `rateinfo` with a call to `rateinfo_init`, passing the `dh` (dsthash_ent) and `hinfo` parameters.

3. The patch replaces the previous implementation of probe_function_filter() with the new find_probe_functions() function.

4. The patch also updates the code to use symbol__next_by_name() to iterate through symbols with the same name.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency and correctness of symbol searching for kprobes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the md (multiple devices) subsystem of the Linux kernel. The issue arises when setting the 'action' to 'idle' in the md subsystem. The code checks the 'sync_thread' variable without holding the 'mddev_lock', which can lead to unsafe behavior.

The patch proposes a solution by introducing a check for the 'MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING' flag before acquiring the 'mddev_lock'. If the flag is set, the patch flushes the workqueue, reaps the sync thread, and then releases the lock. This ensures that the race condition is avoided and prevents confusion caused by multiple threads starting simultaneously.

The patch also includes a 'Fixes' tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the fix and understanding its context.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and reliability of the md subsystem.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and includes the necessary CC and Signed-off-by tags.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug where errors in add_probe_trace_event() are not passed to debuginfo__find_trace_events(). This can cause a segmentation fault if perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob. The patch ensures that tf->ntevs and tf->tevs are not modified if add_probe_trace_event() fails.

The patch includes changes to the add_probe_trace_event() function. It adds error handling code that clears the probe_trace_event and decrements tf->ntevs if add_probe_trace_event() fails. This prevents the segfault and ensures that the failed event is not added.

The patch also includes proper memory allocation checks and error handling for strdup() and zalloc() calls.

The patch has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo. It also has Cc tags from other relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and includes proper error handling. It has been tested and has the necessary tags. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function of `checkpoint.c`. This ensures that the `s_dirty` flag is checked and the checkpoint is skipped if it is not set. This change improves the correctness of the code.

2. The previous condition for skipping the checkpoint was not correct, as it only checked if `s_dirty` was set. However, it is possible for a checkpoint to be done followed by all the node pages being written back, in which case the checkpoint can be omitted. The patch addresses this issue by adding the correct condition.

3. In `super.c`, the patch removes the check for `s_dirty` and `get_pages` in the `f2fs_sync_fs` function. This is because the `s_dirty` check is now done in `write_checkpoint` under `cp_mutex`. This change simplifies the code and avoids redundant checks.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness and simplifies the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition with hardware when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The patch introduces a check after updating the hardware to ensure that the alarm time has not been surpassed. If it has, the alarm is rescheduled.

3. The patch also moves completed alarms to a separate list and executes their callbacks outside the lock, allowing them to reschedule themselves if needed.

4. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from the author and is also CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is intended for stable releases.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a potential race condition and improves the handling of alarms in the driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Given these factors, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

The patch removes a redundant check in the mwifiex_set_encode() function in the mwifiex driver. The check is related to the interface type being AP (Access Point). If the interface type is AP, the function currently returns 0, which means the function exits without deleting the WEP keys. The patch removes this check, allowing the deletion of WEP keys even if the interface type is AP.

The patch claims to fix an issue where if an AP is started with WEP security and then restarted with WPA/WPA2 security, a connected station is able to connect but ping fails. By removing the redundant check, the patch ensures that the WEP keys are deleted, which should resolve the issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It removes a redundant check and fixes a specific issue related to AP and WEP/WPA security transitions.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. Mitigation of the current issue: The patch effectively ratelimits the generation of warning messages by checking if the work is scheduled successfully. If the work is not scheduled, it checks if the ratelimit threshold has been reached before generating the warning message.

3. Limitation of the patch: The patch does not address the underlying problem in usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism, where events can get dropped and not handled. However, it acknowledges this limitation in the patch description.

4. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by Steve Glendinning and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the patch's purpose, the mitigation it provides, and the sign-offs, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the issue of excessive warning messages generated by usbnet.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific problem: The current driver sets the request's DMA address as 0 to mark it as invalid, but some gadget drivers set it to DMA_ADDR_INVALID. This inconsistency leads to incorrect data transmission.

2. The patch fixes the problem by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid. This ensures consistency and prevents bogus data transmission.

3. The patch has been tested and verified by Pavankumar Kondeti <pkondeti@codeaurora.org>, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.

4. The patch includes signed-off-by statements from multiple contributors, indicating their agreement and approval of the changes.

5. The changes made in the patch are localized to the ci13xxx_udc.c file, specifically in the _hardware_enqueue, _hardware_dequeue, ep_alloc_request, and ep_dequeue functions. This minimizes the impact on other parts of the kernel.

2. The patch removes the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() function and replaces it with a kernel helper function, printk(), which can dump up to 64 bytes.

3. The size of the data being dumped in this case is 15 bytes, so using printk() is sufficient.

4. The patch updates the debug message format from using hex_dump_to_buffer() to using the %*ph format specifier in printk(). This format specifier allows printing a buffer of a specified length in hexadecimal format.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the code. It only improves the memory usage and simplifies the code.

6. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes unused return smatch warnings in the tcmu_netlink_event function in drivers/target/target_core_user.c.

2. The patch initializes the "ret" variable to -ENOMEM, which is the error code for out-of-memory conditions.

3. The patch checks if genlmsg_new fails to allocate a new sk_buff and returns the initialized "ret" value (-ENOMEM) instead of -ENOMEM directly.

4. The patch checks if genlmsg_put fails to allocate space for the message header and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value (-ENOMEM).

5. The patch uses nla_put_string and nla_put_u32 to add attributes to the skb. If any of these functions fail, the patch jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value.

6. The patch checks if genlmsg_end fails to finalize the message and jumps to the "free_skb" label to free the sk_buff and return the "ret" value.

7. If all the operations are successful, the patch returns the "ret" value, which is 0.

8. The patch adds a "free_skb" label to handle the cleanup of the sk_buff in case of failures and returns the "ret" value.

Overall, the patch addresses the unused return smatch warnings and handles error conditions properly. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a minor cleanup for the FRAC_BITS value in the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. The patch fixes the issue of hardcoding the value and instead uses the FRAC_BITS macro.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the S25FL127S nor flash part. It mentions that each writing to the configuration register takes a significant amount of time, during which no more accesses to the flash should be done.

2. The patch adds a wait loop after the register writing until the flash finishes its work. This ensures that no further accesses to the flash are made during this time.

3. The issue described in the patch could lead to rootfs mounting failure if the quad enable bit setting step is done too closely to it. This can cause filesystem corruption.

4. The patch includes error handling in case there is a timeout while writing the configuration register. It logs an error message and returns an appropriate error code.

5. The patch also performs a read-back and check of the configuration register to ensure that the quad enable bit is set correctly.

1. Issue Description: The patch addresses a reported issue where a sigbus error occurs when running a specific fio job file with a device dax alignment of 4KB or 2MB. The error is observed in the huge fault code.

2. Patch Solution: The patch introduces a fix to handle fallback when a fault is larger than the device alignment or when a larger fault is encountered while a smaller mapping is already established. The patch ensures that fallback occurs until the fault size matches the alignment.

3. Patch Justification: The patch provides a simple and immediate fix for the reported issue. While supporting larger mappings for a device with a smaller alignment could be considered, it is deemed too large of a change for the immediate fix.

4. Patch Details: The patch modifies the __dax_dev_pud_fault function in the dax.c file. It adds a fault_size variable to store the size of the fault, checks if the fault size is less than the device alignment, and returns VM_FAULT_SIGBUS. If the fault size is greater than the alignment, it returns VM_FAULT_FALLBACK. Additionally, it checks if the fault is outside the VMA range and returns VM_FAULT_SIGBUS in that case as well.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address the reported issue and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the badness score underflow in the out-of-memory (OOM) handling code.
2. The issue occurs when the privileges given to root threads or a negative value of /proc/pid/oom_score_adj exceed the amount of resident set size (rss) of a thread.
3. The patch fixes the issue by making the type of the 'points' variable signed and returns 1 if the value is negative, indicating that the thread is still eligible for kill.
4. The patch includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, acknowledged, and signed-off on the fix.
5. The changes in the patch are localized to the mm/oom_kill.c file, specifically in the oom_badness() function.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported issue and does not introduce any significant risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Therefore, the patch seems to be a cleanup and removal of unnecessary code. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a use-after-free issue in the TIOCMIWAIT function of the quatech2 USB serial driver. This is a critical bug that needs to be addressed.

2. The patch introduces a check for the serial disconnected flag before accessing private port data after waking up. This ensures that the private port data, including the wait queue, is still valid after a disconnect.

3. The patch removes the declaration and initialization of the delta_msr_wait wait queue from the qt2_port_private structure. This is because the wait queue is now accessed through the port structure.

4. The wait_event_interruptible function is modified to use the port->delta_msr_wait wait queue instead of the priv->delta_msr_wait wait queue.

5. The patch adds a check for the serial disconnected flag before returning from the wait_modem_info function. If the serial is disconnected, it returns -EIO.

6. The qt2_update_msr function is modified to wake up the port->delta_msr_wait wait queue instead of the priv->delta_msr_wait wait queue.

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a bug that exists since the preallocation was introduced in commit 9d7730914f4cd496e356acfab95b41075aa8eae8. It fixes a rare case where the entire ring can be filled without emitting a request, causing a flush and wait on the outstanding request. However, after clearing space on the ring, the seqno allocated for the operation is cleared, triggering a sanity check failure.

The fix rearranges the code to ensure that the allocation of the seqno for the operation occurs after any required flushes of outstanding operations. This resolves the issue and ensures that requests are only emitted with a valid seqno.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an out-of-bounds access issue in the f_fs driver of the USB gadget subsystem. The issue occurs when accessing the companion descriptor for SuperSpeed endpoints, which is not allocated for HighSpeed or FullSpeed endpoints. This leads to a kernel bug and a bad access detection.

The patch addresses this issue by checking if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. If the gadget is not SuperSpeed, the companion descriptor is not accessed.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It resolves a bug that can lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior, and it does not introduce any new risks or regressions.
true || Based on the provided patch, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that there was a mistake in the check of the return value from __find_format() and that this patch fixes the regression introduced in a previous commit.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the condition in the if statement was inverted. Previously, the code checked if the format was not found (!format) and now it checks if the format was found (format).

3. The original code assigns the format to fmt->format if it is found, and returns -EINVAL if it is not found. With the patch, the assignment will only happen if the format is found, and if it is not found, the assignment will not occur, leaving fmt->format uninitialized.

4. This change introduces a potential bug where fmt->format may contain uninitialized data if the format is not found. This can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect behavior in the code that uses fmt->format.

5. Therefore, accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases could introduce a regression and potential bugs.

Based on this analysis, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The regression was introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16, which removed the list of pinned inactive objects.
3. The crash occurs in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl() function, specifically at line 3661, where the BUG_ON(!list_empty(&dev_priv->mm.inactive_list)) check is made.
4. According to Chris, the BUG_ON check is unnecessary and can be safely removed. The checks are a crude approximation and are too late to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state.
5. Removing the BUG_ON statement will not introduce any new issues and will fix the regression caused by the previous commit.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to resolve the regression issue.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

   - The bug occurs when the function is called recursively, leading to a deadlock situation.
   - The issue is not easily detectable due to the lack of printks on the serial console.

2. Solution: The patch proposes a solution to avoid locking in the sysrq case and use trylock in the oops_in_progress case.
   - This approach is already used in other drivers and helps prevent similar bugs.
   - The patch suggests moving this scheme to a common place to avoid copy/paste/modify bugs.

3. Additional issue: The patch identifies another issue related to the port->sysrq indicator.
   - If port->sysrq is not reset, all console writes happen unlocked, leaving the current writer unprotected against certain operations.
   - The patch proposes a separate indicator port->sysrq_cpu and changes the locking check accordingly.

4. Scope: The patch acknowledges that the proposed solution goes beyond the scope of this fix and should be implemented in a common function.
   - This would help avoid future copy/paste/modify bugs.

5. Testing: The patch includes a reported-and-tested-by tag, indicating that it has been tested by Tim Sander.

Considering the provided analysis and the proposed solution, it seems reasonable to accept this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch fixes a bug where F-RTO may incorrectly send more probes if the next ACK advances SND_UNA and does not sack new packets.
3. The bug can cause the sender to always send new data instead of repairing holes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.
4. The patch modifies the code to correctly handle the conditions for sending F-RTO probes, ensuring that they are sent only once as specified in the RFC 5682.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and maintainers.

Considering the specific problem addressed and the correctness of the patch, it is recommended to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit (fcc60b413d14dd06ddbd79ec50e83c4fb2a097ba) that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged.

2. The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require calling prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical.

3. The original commit mentioned that preventing waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates, but the patch suggests that there are better ways to fix this issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It allows the driver to decide when prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions are necessary, rather than handling all the special cases in the core.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Given this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The race condition issue is a significant concern, and reverting the commit is a reasonable solution until a proper way to support kexec within the DRM is identified and implemented.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

2. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

3. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to use the synack_stamp instead of tp->lsndtime to compute the SYNACK RTT.

4. If the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the (Fast Open'd) data packets sent in SYN_RECV, the SYNACK RTT is the smooth RTT computed in tcp_ack().

5. The patch introduces a new variable synack_stamp to store the SYNACK timestamp.

6. The patch updates the synack_stamp value based on whether a request_sock is present or not.

7. The patch calls tcp_synack_rtt_meas() with the updated synack_stamp value.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open. It introduces a necessary fix and does not seem to have any negative side effects. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a reject for the MPC5121 platform if an input-only pin is requested to be set as an output. This is done to comply with the reference manual (18.3.1.1). This change ensures that input-only pins cannot be mistakenly set as output pins.

2. The patch also rewrites the mach-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which improves scalability.

3. The patch adds a new function, `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out`, which checks if the requested GPIO pin is within the range of 28 to 31 (inclusive) and returns an error if it is. Otherwise, it calls the existing `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function.

4. The patch modifies the `gc->direction_output` assignment in the `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function. It now checks if the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc5121-gpio" and assigns `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` as the direction output function. Otherwise, it assigns `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out`. This change ensures that the correct direction output function is used based on the device compatibility.

5. The patch also modifies the `gc->get` assignment in the `mpc8xxx_add_controller` function. It now checks if the device is compatible with "fsl,mpc8572-gpio" and assigns `mpc8572_gpio_get` as the get function. Otherwise, it assigns `mpc8xxx_gpio_get`. This change ensures that the correct get function is used based on the device compatibility.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch is a bug fix and improves the compatibility and functionality of the MPC5121 platform. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch introduces a new function called `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` to clear the RWC (Read/Write Clear) bit in the PORTSC (Port Status and Control) register.

2. The function `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` reads the current value of the PORTSC register for a specific port, checks if the RWC bit is set, and if so, clears it by setting the port state to neutral and setting the RWC bit.

3. The patch modifies the `xhci_bus_resume()` function in `xhci-hub.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) bit in the PORTSC register for each port during bus resume.

4. The patch also modifies the `handle_port_status()` function in `xhci-ring.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC bit in the PORTSC register for a specific port after resuming the port.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to correctly clear the RWC and PLC bits in the PORTSC register during bus resume and port status handling. This patch seems to be a bug fix and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions.

However, it is important to note that the patch author acknowledges that this is not the proper fix and that a more comprehensive solution is being pursued by Daniel Vetter. Therefore, it is recommended to keep an eye on the progress of the proper fix and eventually replace this temporary fix with the permanent solution once it becomes available.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests changing the module_init() call to subsys_initcall() for the ulpi_init() function in the ulpi.c file. This change ensures that ulpi_init() is executed during the subsys_init phase, which is a later stage in the kernel initialization process.

The rationale behind this change is that phy drivers and ulpi interface providers depend on the registration of the ulpi bus. By executing ulpi_init() in subsys_initcall, it ensures that the ulpi bus is registered before the drivers and interface providers are probed. This prevents unnecessary delays and potential -EPROBE_DEFER errors.

The patch has been reported by Zhuo Qiuxu and signed-off by Lu Baolu. It has also been acknowledged by Heikki Krogerus. The patch seems to address a specific issue and has received some level of review and approval.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The handling of bypass_val_on in regulator_get_bypass_regmap is done unconditionally, causing drivers without a defined value for bypass_val_on to report bypass being enabled incorrectly.

2. The patch fixes the issue by adding similar handling in regulator_get_bypass_regmap. It checks if bypass_val_on is zero and uses bypass_mask instead.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a previous commit that introduced the issue.

4. The patch has been signed-off by the original author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and has been reviewed by the relevant parties. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch simplifies the netlink message length assignment in the connector documentation. It replaces the calculation of the message length by subtracting the netlink header length from the size and then adding it back using the NLMSG_LENGTH() macro. 

The change in line 71 updates the nlmsg_len field of the netlink header to use the precalculated size directly, rather than subtracting the header length and adding it back. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

2. The patch introduces a new variable "chnb" in the at91_adc_state structure.
3. In the handle_adc_eoc_trigger() function, the patch replaces the read from AT91_ADC_LCDR with AT91_ADC_CHAN(st, st->chnb).
4. In the at91_adc_rl_interrupt() and at91_adc_9x5_interrupt() functions, the patch replaces the check for the drdy_mask with GENMASK(st->num_channels - 1, 0).
5. In the at91_adc_read_raw() function, the patch sets the "chnb" variable to the channel number.
6. The patch replaces the drdy_mask with BIT(chan->channel) in the at91_adc_read_raw() function.
7. The patch removes the write to AT91_ADC_IER and AT91_ADC_IDR with st->registers->drdy_mask in the at91_adc_read_raw() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses a potential issue with the last converted data register when touchscreen mode is enabled and a conversion is requested on another channel. It removes a temporal constraint and improves the reliability of the conversion value by taking it from the channel data register instead. The patch also includes appropriate Acked-by tags from relevant individuals.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific problem: The backref code was incorrectly looking at nodes as well as leaves when populating extent item entries in Btrfs. This can lead to unexpected issues when random_memory matches disk_bytenr.

2. The patch fixes the problem by adding a condition to check if the reference is an extent item and if the level is 0 (leaf level). This ensures that only leaf nodes are considered for extent item entries.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Josef Bacik and Chris Mason, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch is relatively small and focused, making it less likely to introduce new issues.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the call to the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` in the `filelayout_async_handle_error()` function in `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.c`. The reason for removing this call is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call, resulting in a NULL pointer and potentially causing an Oops.

Instead of relying on `nfs4_ds_disconnect()`, the patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid any issues with the device ID. This change ensures that the device ID is marked as invalid, preventing any potential problems caused by dereferencing a NULL pointer.

The patch also removes the declaration and definition of `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` from `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.h` and `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayoutdev.c` respectively, as it is no longer needed.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue and provides a safer alternative. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue where calling dev_close() in the offline self-test clears IFF_UP, which removes interface routes and addresses. This behavior is inconsistent and not intended by the user.

2. The patch suggests calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(), avoiding the clearing of IFF_UP altogether.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes in the ixgbe_open() and ixgbe_close() functions to replace the dev_open() and dev_close() calls with ixgbe_open() and ixgbe_close() respectively.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been tested by another individual.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a more consistent behavior. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The bug was reported and tested by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki.
3. The patch fixes the issue by checking the sc->memcg pointer instead of using memcg_kmem_enabled(). This change ensures that only memcg aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs and only if memcg_kmem_enabled is true.
4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh.
5. The patch is also marked as suitable for stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org [4.6+]).

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a valid issue and has received positive reviews and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests reverting a deprecation warning for the SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP module. The reasons for reverting the warning are as follows:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and is considered set in stone. Therefore, there is no need for a deprecation warning.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. Many SCTP appliances are slow to migrate to newer kernels, so it is necessary to support SCTP_SNDRCV on older kernels.

3) Some users may not have the ability to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users will encounter the warning and be stuck with older kernels.

Considering these reasons, it seems reasonable to revert the deprecation warning. The patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and has been reviewed and acknowledged by him. It has also been signed-off by Daniel Borkmann and David S. Miller.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The mcc/mbox lock is not being released when be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

2. The patch introduces a fix by adding a new code block that releases the lock and returns -EBUSY in case be_cmd_copy() fails.

3. The patch also includes a label "unlock" that allows the lock to be released before returning from the function.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes, but rather fixes a potential resource leak.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple authors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

The patch adds a boolean variable "first" to keep track of whether it is the first column or not, and adjusts the formatting accordingly.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the DIRECT_IRQ bit in the pinctrl-baytrail driver. It states that the DIRECT_IRQ bit should be cleared for pads using the io mode, as not doing so can prevent the io-based IRQ from being detected.

2. The patch includes a WARN statement to trigger a warning if the DIRECT_IRQ bit is not cleared in the io mode. This helps identify and debug any misconfigurations caused by this issue.

3. The patch also clears other relevant bits (BYT_TRIG_POS, BYT_TRIG_NEG, BYT_TRIG_LVL) to ensure proper functionality.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Mika Westerberg, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and Linus Walleij, which indicates that they take responsibility for the code changes.

Considering these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue, includes proper error handling, and has been reviewed and approved by other developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests avoiding the use of variable-length arrays in kernel/sys.c. It explains that variable-length arrays can generate worse code and may cause issues on the POWER architecture, specifically with register r28 corruption. The patch concludes that since variable-length arrays are generally discouraged and there are potential compiler issues, it is better to avoid using them.

The patch modifies the code by replacing the variable-length array declaration with a fixed-size array declaration of size 65. This change ensures that the array size is always valid and eliminates the use of variable-length arrays.

Considering the reasoning provided in the patch and the potential issues with variable-length arrays, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. By making this change, the code will be more robust and less prone to potential issues caused by variable-length arrays.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch disables the use of shadow registers by default in the iwlwifi driver. Shadow registers are used to update certain device registers without waking up all components of the device. However, using this feature has caused communication issues and host command timeouts.

2. The patch sets the "shadow_reg_enable" parameter to false for multiple iwlwifi devices (iwl2000, iwl2030, iwl6000, iwl6050, and iwl6000_g2). This effectively disables the use of shadow registers until a fix is available for the bugs associated with this feature.

3. The patch includes appropriate comments indicating that the feature should be fixed in the future.

Considering the communication issues and timeouts caused by using shadow registers, disabling this feature by default is a reasonable approach until the bugs are resolved. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference in the sctp_process_init function of the SCTP module. This issue can lead to a kernel panic when a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet is received.

2. Root cause: The sctp_get_af_specific function returns NULL when the parameter type is not SCTP_PARAM_IPV4_ADDRESS or SCTP_PARAM_IPV6_ADDRESS. This NULL value is then dereferenced unconditionally through af->from_addr_param, causing the kernel panic.

3. Solution: The patch adds a NULL check for the af variable after calling sctp_get_af_specific. If af is NULL, the loop is broken, preventing the subsequent dereference.

4. Impact: The patch fixes the NULL pointer dereference issue, ensuring that the kernel does not panic when receiving malformed packets.

5. Fixes: The patch includes a reference to the commit that introduced the issue and is signed-off by the author and other relevant individuals.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to address the NULL pointer dereference issue in the SCTP module.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Considering the nature of the patch, which addresses a bug and provides a necessary fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, even though the Software Developer's Manual (SDM) states that it is invalid.
2. The code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).
3. To get from 64-bit mode to real mode, the patch clears CS.L and CR4.PCIDE.
4. If the vCPU supports long mode, the patch performs additional steps:
   a. It checks if CR4.PCIDE is set and clears it before CR0.PG.
   b. It sets up a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA.
5. It clears CR0.PG and CR0.PE if CR0.PE is set.
6. It clears CR4.PAE if CR4.PAE is set.
7. It sets MSR_EFER to 0 to go back to 32-bit mode.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds support for exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode, which is not explicitly allowed according to the SDM. However, the patch ensures a safe state by clearing necessary registers and flags before transitioning back to real mode or 32-bit mode.

Please note that this recommendation is based solely on the provided information. A more thorough review and testing may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the madvise_free_huge_pmd function in the mm/huge_memory.c file. The issue is that if part pages of a Transparent Huge Page (THP) are discarded, the THP will be split, and fallback Page Table Entry (PTE) operations should be used if splitting succeeds. However, the original code skips the fallback PTE operations after splitting succeeds.

The patch fixes this by making madvise_free_huge_pmd return 0 after successfully splitting the THP. This ensures that the fallback PTE operations will be performed.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Minchan Kim, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted developer.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure correct behavior when discarding part pages of THPs.

The patch suggests using the timer API functions `setup_timer` and `mod_timer` instead of structure assignments to set and update the timer's expire field. This change aligns with the standard way of handling timers in the Linux kernel.

The patch includes a semantic patch that replaces the existing code with the new timer API functions. It modifies the `pasemi_mac_open` function in the `pasemi_mac.c` file.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:

1. Replaces the `init_timer` function call with `setup_timer` to initialize the `mac->tx->clean_timer` timer.
2. Replaces the structure assignments for `function`, `data`, and `expires` with the appropriate arguments in the `setup_timer` call.
3. Adds a `mod_timer` call to update the timer's expiration time using `jiffies + HZ`.

These changes improve code readability and maintainability by using the standard timer API functions instead of direct structure assignments.

Considering the benefits of using the timer API functions and the correctness of the patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The patch proposes a more generic approach to the GRO L2 header check, taking into account the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes.
3. The patch introduces a conditional check based on the value of maclen (skb->dev->hard_header_len) to handle the common case (Ethernet) without using a memcmp() call, improving performance.
4. If maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length), the existing compare_ether_header() function is used to compare the headers.
5. If maclen is not equal to ETH_HLEN, indicating a non-Ethernet header, a memcmp() call is used to compare the headers.
6. The patch also sets the NAPI_GRO_CB(p)->same_flow flag based on the comparison result.

Overall, this patch improves the generic L2 header check in the GRO code and addresses the reported issue. It introduces a more flexible approach and maintains performance optimizations for the common case. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential lost wakeup scenario in the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl function of the staging driver quatech_usb2. Currently, when the usermode app performs the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl, it waits for a change in the modem status by setting the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and calling schedule(). The wakeup is expected to occur when qt2_process_modem_status sets port_extra->shadowMSR to the new modem status.

However, there is a race condition between the loop in qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) and the URB completion in qt2_process_modem_status, which can result in a lost wakeup scenario. This means that the usermode app's task may continue to sleep despite a change in the modem status.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a barrier() to ensure memory ordering, setting the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and setting it back to TASK_RUNNING when returning from the loop. This ensures that the task is properly woken up and prevents the lost wakeup scenario.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the identified issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The current check prevents adding an irq_domain to an irq descriptor when `irq_data` exists, which is true when the irq descriptor already exists. This bug went unnoticed because the simple domain code did not enter this code path.

2. The patch splits the check for `irq_data == NULL` and adds a separate warning for it. This improves the clarity of the code and makes it easier to identify the specific issue.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and maintainers involved in the patch.

4. The patch also includes appropriate Cc tags to notify relevant individuals and mailing lists about the patch.

5. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list for reference.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug in the `irq_domain_add()` function.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to an infinite loop in the Exynos DRM driver when using a multi-platform kernel. Resolving this issue is important for stability and performance.

2. The patch introduces a temporary solution by registering the Exynos DRM device object only for Exynos SoC. This prevents the infinite loop issue from occurring.

3. The patch includes a comment explaining the purpose of the temporary solution and mentions that a more generic approach will be implemented in the future. This indicates that the patch is a step towards a better long-term solution.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant developer.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the infinite loop issue in the Exynos DRM driver.

1. The patch addresses two audio bugs in the hdpvr driver. The first bug is related to changing the audio encoding, which inadvertently changes the input as well. The second bug affects the default_audio_input module option handling, preventing the audio encoding from switching to AC3 if default_audio_input is set to 2 (SPDIF input).

2. The first bug has always been present, but starting from kernel version 3.10, it always occurs when the driver is loaded due to changes in audio encoding handling. Previously, it would only surface if the user changed the audio encoding after the driver was loaded.

3. The patch also fixes a small typo in a comment (bufffer -> buffer).

4. The patch is signed-off by the original author and reported by another individual, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

5. The patch is also marked for stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), suggesting that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the mentioned audio bugs and improve the hdpvr driver's functionality.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix an issue with the trace_marker file in the Linux kernel. The issue is that the trace mark is added to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer.

Upon reviewing the patch, it seems to address the problem by introducing a new variable `tr` of type `struct trace_array` and assigning it the value of `filp->private_data`. This new variable is then used to access the correct instance's buffer.

Considering the nature of the patch and the problem it addresses, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that further testing and review may be necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects or regressions.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch removes the duplicate call to `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` for `ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE` within `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. This duplication is unnecessary since the call is already made during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation.

2. The patch also removes the local `conn->stat_sn` assignment and increment, indicating that this should be handled by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

3. The third parameter of `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` is changed to `true`, indicating that the `iscsi_scsi_rsp` structure should be used for building the response PDU.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making necessary changes to avoid duplication and improve code organization. It also aligns the behavior with the intended design by removing the local assignment and increment of `conn->stat_sn`. The patch has been tested and has a Tested-by tag.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses a performance issue and improves GPU utilization by enabling all render backends. Additionally, it has been signed-off by the relevant maintainers and includes a reference to the stable mailing list for further consideration.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the intention is to fix a long-standing bug by releasing the controller's lock while calling the gadget API function pointers. This is done by adding a spin_unlock() before calling the resume() function and a spin_lock() after it.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Releasing the lock during the resume operation can help prevent potential deadlocks or other issues that may arise from holding the lock for an extended period.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a memory leak in the code. The patch fixes the issue by adding a call to kfree() to free the memory allocated for "dt" in case of an error. 

Considering that memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend a NAK (not accepting) for this Linux kernel patch. Here's the analysis:

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression and resolves a bug in rfkill notification, which improves the stability and functionality of the kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch and description, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The code attempts to grab a crtc mutex during intel_modeset_setup_hw_state(), which can lead to a deadlock when the pipe A force quirk is applied. This patch aims to avoid this deadlock situation.

2. The proposed solution is to replace drm_modeset_lock_all() with mutex_lock(&dev->mode_config.mutex) and drm_modeset_unlock_all() with mutex_unlock(&dev->mode_config.mutex). By using the mode_config.mutex instead of grabbing all crtc mutexes, the patch avoids the deadlock and resolves the issue.

3. The patch includes a reference to the commit that introduced the regression, providing context and helping to identify the root cause of the problem.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the original author and another developer, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the deadlock issue.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the xmon data-breakpoint feature, which is currently broken. The issue arises when the hw_breakpoint_handler is called by do_break via notifier chains mechanism. If the watchpoint is registered by xmon, the hw_breakpoint_handler does not find any associated perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. As a result, do_break also returns without notifying xmon.

The proposed solution in the patch is to modify the return value of hw_breakpoint_handler when no perf_event is associated with the matched watchpoint. Instead of returning NOTIFY_STOP, which would skip notifying xmon, the patch suggests returning NOTIFY_DONE. This change ensures that the core code continues calling other breakpoint handlers, including the xmon one.

The patch includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the relevant individuals. Additionally, it is marked for consideration in stable releases, suggesting that it addresses a bug that affects stable versions of the Linux kernel.

9. The patch stops searching for an idle sibling when it reaches the domain that spans the current CPU and the previous CPU.
10. The patch uses appropriate locking mechanisms (rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock) to ensure thread safety.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to SMT balancing and has been tested and reviewed by multiple developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets the queue limits for the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This helps ensure that the command size on the admin queue is not arbitrarily low and that other limitations are properly applied.

2. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function sets various queue limits based on the device-specific properties of the `nvme_ctrl` structure. These limits include maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush requirements, and virtual boundary. By applying these limits, the patch ensures that the admin queue is properly configured.

3. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function is called in two places: during controller initialization (`nvme_init_identify`) and when allocating a new namespace (`nvme_alloc_ns`). This ensures that the admin queue limits are set correctly at the appropriate times.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs, reported-by, tested-by, and reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has undergone review and testing by multiple individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with the admin queue in the NVMe driver and introduces a helper function to set the necessary queue limits. It has been reviewed and tested, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 platforms. The reason for this removal is that when the "gpmc_fck" clock is obtained in gpmc.c, it results in misconfigured timings and devices being lost due to divisions by zero.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). By removing the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks, the patch ensures that gpmc.c can fail gracefully instead of causing misconfigurations and device loss.

However, it is important to note that this recommendation is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A thorough review of the code changes and testing in relevant environments should be conducted before finalizing the decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch defines a new state called "CONNECTED" for a ceph connection. This state is set when the connection sequence completes successfully and cleared when the connection gets closed. This explicit state definition improves the clarity and maintainability of the code.

2. The patch also updates the code to be more careful when examining the old state during a socket disconnect event. It clears the "CONNECTED" state when a disconnect event occurs.

3. The patch includes changes in three different functions: ceph_con_close(), process_connect(), and try_read(). These changes ensure that the "CONNECTED" state is properly set and cleared in different scenarios.

4. The patch also includes a change in the con_work() function to handle the case when the socket is closed. It sets the appropriate error message based on the connection state.

Overall, the patch introduces a necessary and well-defined state for ceph connections and improves the handling of socket disconnect events. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the usb gadget serial function. It describes a situation where the 'port->port_usb' pointer is cleaned in the gserial_disconnect() function, but during the lock release period, a request may be completed in gs_write_complete() -> gs_start_tx() function, causing a crash because 'port->port_usb' has been set to NULL.

The patch adds a pointer checking in gs_start_tx() to avoid this crash. It checks if 'port->port_usb' is NULL and returns without making any changes if it is.

This patch seems to be a straightforward fix for a potential crash scenario. It does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could have unintended consequences. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes an issue reported by Coverity, where the allocation size in the devres_alloc() function is incorrect. The patch corrects the allocation size to sizeof(*rcwdd) instead of sizeof(*wdd). This ensures that the correct size is allocated for the watchdog_device structure.

Additionally, the patch includes the necessary Fixes and Acked-by tags, indicating that the issue has been identified and reviewed by relevant individuals.

Therefore, considering the nature of the fix and the appropriate tags, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of in_irq() in the intel_check_page_flip() function. It explains that in_irq() only tests for hard-IRQ context, which can lead to warnings when the system is run with the 'threadirqs' option selected.

2. The patch proposes using in_interrupt() instead of in_irq(). This change allows for either type of interrupt and still detects and complains about misuse of the page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

3. The patch includes a reference to the Bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321) where the issue is reported.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the drm/radeon/dpm and drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/rv770_dpm files. It replaces the manual lookup of the max_vddc value with the use of a stored value.

In both files, the patch checks if the vddc value is set to 0xff01. If it is, instead of calling radeon_atom_get_max_vddc to look up the value, it uses the stored max_vddc value from the power_info structure (pi->max_vddc).

This change improves efficiency by avoiding the repeated lookup of the max_vddc value and instead using the stored value directly.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable optimization that does not introduce any new risks or issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable, causing the device to not wake up for important events like HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request.

2. The patch mentions that there were previous attempts to fix this issue for some people by patching the xHCI USB controller, but it did not work for everyone. This suggests that the problem may lie in the USB subsystem, USB host controllers, or hardware issues.

3. The author states that the only safe action at the moment is to revert the patch, indicating that the current implementation is causing issues and there is no known solution.

Based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to accept the patch and revert the changes that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. This will prevent potential issues and ensure stability in the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. It considers the number of Tx queues while calculating the length of Tx statistics.
3. It calculates the statistics length properly for both 82xx and 83xx adapters.
4. The patch includes changes to the qlcnic_82xx_statistics and qlcnic_83xx_statistics functions to calculate the length correctly.
5. The qlcnic_dev_statistics_len function is modified to handle both 82xx and 83xx adapters and return the correct length.
6. The patch also handles the case when the QLogic eSwitch is enabled, adding additional statistics length.
7. The qlcnic_get_sset_count function is modified to return the correct statistics length based on the adapter type.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue in the qlcnic driver and improves the accuracy of statistics length calculation. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch corrects a logic error in the original implementation. This indicates that there was a mistake in the code that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch suggests an alternate solution, which is to remove the lines that disable the clock and leave it running as it is reconfigured later during boot. This implies that the clock disabling logic might not be necessary or could be handled differently.

3. The patch is signed-off by Simon Horman and Paul Mundt, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. In the file "mmcif-sh7372.c," the line `__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) & (1 << 12), SMSTPCR3);` is changed to `__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) | (1 << 12), SMSTPCR3);`. This change modifies the logic for disabling the clock to the MMC hardware block.

5. In the file "sdhi-sh7372.c," the line `__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) & (1 << 13), SMSTPCR3);` is changed to `__raw_writel(__raw_readl(SMSTPCR3) | (1 << 13), SMSTPCR3);`. This change modifies the logic for disabling the clock to the SDHI1 hardware block.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch corrects a logic error and provides an alternate solution, which suggests that the original code could be improved. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by experienced developers.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue in the rtnl_calcit() function in the RT netlink code. The function is responsible for calculating the minimal size for a netlink dump message.

2. The problem with the current implementation is that it doesn't account for the size of the header of the netlink message.

3. The patch proposes to fix this issue by returning the total size of the message, including the header, using the nlmsg_total_size() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue in the RT netlink code and ensures that the dump message for every network device can be stored correctly.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The patch clears the PLC (Port Link Change) bit for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Bug severity: If the bug being fixed by this patch is critical and affects the stability or functionality of USB2 root hub ports, it is more likely to be accepted in -stable releases.

2. Code correctness: We need to ensure that the patch does not introduce any new bugs or regressions. It is important to review the code changes and verify that they are correct and do not have any unintended side effects.

3. Code maintainability: The patch should follow the coding style and conventions of the Linux kernel. It should be easy to understand and maintain in the long term.

4. Testing: The patch should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it resolves the reported issue and does not cause any regressions. It is important to verify that the patch works as intended on different hardware configurations and scenarios.

However, without additional context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. A thorough review of the patch, including testing and consideration of the factors mentioned above, would be necessary to determine whether it should be accepted in -stable releases.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer (ACK or NAK) without further analysis and context.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference issue introduced in a previous commit. This issue can lead to a crash or undefined behavior.

2. The patch correctly identifies the root cause of the issue. It occurs when the function `wait_event_interruptible` is called before `functionfs_bind()`, resulting in `epfile->ffs->gadget` being NULL.

3. The patch resolves the issue by moving the assignment of `epfile->ffs->gadget` to the local `gadget` variable after the waiting has completed. This ensures that `gadget` is not dereferenced before it is properly assigned.

4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` and `Acked-by` tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the NULL pointer dereference issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a connector quirk for a specific board (Fujitsu D3003-S2) in the radeon driver of the DRM subsystem. This indicates that there is a specific issue related to this board that needs to be addressed.

2. The patch includes a link to a bug report (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83184), which provides additional context and justification for the patch.

3. The patch modifies the radeon_atom_apply_quirks() function, which is responsible for applying various quirks to the Radeon GPU's AtomBIOS. This function is called during the initialization of the DRM device.

4. The added code checks if the device's PCI device ID, subsystem vendor ID, and subsystem device ID match the values for the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board. If they do, and the connector type is VGA, the function returns false, indicating that the VGA connector should not be used.

5. The patch is signed-off by Alex Deucher, who is a maintainer of the radeon driver, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a knowledgeable person.

6. The patch includes the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list in the Cc field, suggesting that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Considering the patch's simplicity and the fact that it addresses a specific issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module in the Linux kernel. It aims to inject a #GP (General Protection) exception when a guest sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value.

2. The patch adds a check in the vmx_set_msr() function in the arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c file. If the vmcs_config.vmentry_ctrl indicates that the PAT CR should be loaded during entry, the kvm_mtrr_valid() function is called to validate the value. If the value is invalid, the function returns 1, indicating that a #GP exception should be injected.

3. The kvm_mtrr_valid() function is defined in the arch/x86/kvm/x86.c file. It performs checks on the MSR (Model Specific Register) value and data to ensure that they are valid MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) values. If the values are valid, the function returns true.

4. The kvm_mtrr_valid() function is also declared in the arch/x86/kvm/x86.h file, indicating that it is intended to be used by other modules.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue with the check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK being inverted. This means that the hardware was going to full sleep even if there was a pending transmission, which is incorrect behavior.

2. The issue was reported by Sujith Manoharan and signed-off by Felix Fietkau, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the community.

3. The patch includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, suggesting that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

4. The patch modifies the ath9k/main.c file, specifically the ath9k_ps_restore() function, which is relevant to the ath9k wireless driver.

5. The changes in the patch correctly handle the PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK flag and ensure that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission is pending.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue, has been reviewed, and is suitable for inclusion in stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The h5_reset_rx() function frees the Rx skb, but not returning after that can cause a kernel oops when h5_rx_payload() is called and dereferences a NULL Rx skb.

2. The patch adds a return statement after calling h5_reset_rx(h5), which prevents the subsequent h5_rx_payload() call from causing a kernel oops.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from Loic Poulain and Marcel Holtmann, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch also includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is intended for stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and the time difference is just a little larger than half a buffer time. In such cases, the current implementation incorrectly treats the interrupt as a double acknowledged interrupt.

To fix this, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to the comparison value of `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that even in scenarios where the time difference is slightly larger than half a buffer time, the interrupt is not considered double acknowledged.

Additionally, the patch acknowledges the potential inaccuracy of `jiffies` as it is not a high-resolution timer.

Considering the provided information, the patch appears to address a specific issue and improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata. The current implementation uses the padded length instead of the real length, which is against the specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all specified metadata has been 32-bit, where aligned and data length are the same width. The patch corrects this behavior by using the real length.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it is safe to include it.

3. The patch removes magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag to reference the commit that introduced the issue.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and improves code quality without introducing any new risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch and its description, it appears that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the removal of code in commit 25cd2882e2fc, which resulted in the lpm_capable field not being set for the root hub device.
2. The patch explains that the root hub device is a special USB device without a parent, and as a result, the hub_port_init() function, which sets lpm_capable, is never called for the root hub.
3. The patch adds code to check and set lpm_capable when registering a root hub device, ensuring that lpm functionality is functional in the Linux kernel.
4. The patch can be back-ported to older kernels as old as v3.15, which indicates that it is a stable fix.
5. The patch has been Acked-by Alan Stern, indicating that it has received approval from a trusted source.

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current implementation counts all interrupts as false ones if the driver cannot handle them. However, there may be cases where a SCI EC interrupt is fired during normal read/write operations, which should not be considered false interrupts. The patch aims to fix this problem.

2. The patch includes proper documentation: The commit message clearly explains the issue and the proposed solution. It also includes the signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. The code changes are straightforward: The patch modifies the `advance_transaction()` function in the `ec.c` file. It adds a condition to check if the SCI bit is set in the interrupt status. If it is set, the interrupt is not considered false, and the IRQ count is not incremented.

4. The change is well-justified: The patch ensures that SCI EC interrupts during normal read/write operations are not incorrectly counted as false interrupts. This improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the ACPI/EC subsystem.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the calculate_imbalance() function in the sched/balancing module. The bug occurs when the local average load is greater than or equal to the busiest average load, which can result in an imbalance overflow. This can lead to constant task bouncing between CPUs, especially when there are pinned tasks.

The patch fixes this issue by skipping the assignment and assuming an imbalance of 0 when the local average load is greater than or equal to the sds (scheduling domain span) average load.

The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the original author and the maintainers, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Additionally, a link to the original discussion thread is provided for further reference.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent the mentioned issue and improve the stability of the kernel.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to extend the initial check for PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to cover all RGMII variants. This is important because EEE (Energy Efficient Ethernet) should be allowed for any RGMII mode, as it is a property of the RGMII and the Gigabit PHY capability.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit (a59a4d192166).

3. The patch has been signed-off by Florian Fainelli and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code changes in the patch are straightforward and do not introduce any potential issues or regressions.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating their approval and agreement with the changes.
4. The changes are localized to the "wacom_wac.c" file, specifically in the "wacom_intuos_inout" and "wacom_bpt_pen" functions.
5. The changes do not appear to introduce any new issues or regressions.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to improve the behavior of tablets that support both pen and touch input.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue introduced by a previous commit (abfb7b686a3e) related to FDT manipulation after the invocation of ExitBootServices() in AArch64 UEFI implementations.
2. The issue arises when the MMU is disabled in ExitBootServices(), causing unaligned accesses to RAM to no longer be supported.
3. The patch moves the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that FDT manipulation occurs before the MMU is disabled, avoiding alignment faults.
4. The patch also highlights that disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices() is not compliant with the UEFI spec and carries great risk due to potential issues with switching from cached to uncached memory accesses.
5. The patch includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.
6. It has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Riku Voipio.
7. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Ard Biesheuvel and Ingo Molnar.
8. It includes appropriate Cc tags for relevant individuals and mailing lists.

1. The patch is titled "drm/exynos/mixer: correct vsync configuration sequence" and provides a correction to the vsync configuration sequence in the exynos_mixer.c file.

2. The patch is signed-off by Andrzej Hajda and reviewed by Joonyoung Shim, both from Samsung.

3. In the code changes, the patch modifies the enable_vblank function by adding two new lines of code:
   - The first line clears the vsync indicator by writing to the MXR_INT_STATUS register with the MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC mask.
   - The second line enables the vsync interrupt by writing to the MXR_INT_EN register with the MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC mask.

4. The patch also modifies the disable_vblank function by adding one new line of code:
   - The line clears the vsync indicator by writing to the MXR_INT_STATUS register with the MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC mask.

5. Lastly, the patch modifies the mixer_enable function by adding an if statement:
   - The if statement checks if the MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC flag is set in the ctx->int_en variable.
   - If the flag is set, it clears the vsync indicator by writing to the MXR_INT_STATUS register with the MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC mask.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the vsync configuration sequence in the exynos_mixer.c file. The changes made in the patch ensure that the vsync indicator is properly cleared before configuring vsync and that the vsync interrupt is enabled correctly.

The patch is aimed at the amdgpu driver in the Linux kernel and addresses the issue of adding PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) fan control attributes when DPM (Dynamic Power Management) is disabled. The patch adds a check to skip the creation of sysfs nodes for PWM attributes if DPM is not enabled.

The rationale behind this patch is that PWM fan control is only available with DPM, and there is no non-DPM support on amdgpu. Therefore, there should never be a crash caused by accessing these sysfs nodes when DPM is disabled. However, the check is added as an extra precaution to ensure safety.

The patch modifies the `hwmon_attributes_visible` function in `amdgpu_pm.c` by adding the check for DPM-enabled before allowing the creation of PWM-related sysfs nodes.

Overall, this patch seems reasonable and addresses a potential issue. It ensures that the sysfs nodes for PWM attributes are not created when DPM is disabled, preventing any potential crashes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Since this patch is only a documentation update and does not introduce any code changes or fixes, it does not have any impact on the stability or functionality of the Linux kernel. Therefore, it can be considered a low-risk change and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a race condition in the RX (receive) path of virtio_net.
   - Explanation: The virtio_net driver calls virtqueue_enable_cq after napi_complete, violating the requirement to synchronize virtqueue_enable_cq with virtqueue_add_buf. This can cause the used event to move backwards, resulting in lost interrupts.
   - Impact: In a debug build, this race condition can trigger a panic within START_USE.

2. Solution: The patch fixes the race condition by modifying the order of function calls.
   - Explanation: The patch suggests calling virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare with NAPI_STATE_SCHED set (under the napi lock) and later calling virtqueue_poll with NAPI_STATE_SCHED clear (outside the lock).
   - Impact: This ensures that napi_complete is called to clear NAPI_STATE_SCHED before polling the virtqueue for used buffers, preventing the loss of RX events.

3. Test and Acknowledgment: The patch has been tested and acknowledged by Jason Wang.
   - Reported-by: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>
   - Tested-by: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may not be fully initialized, resulting in default values. In such cases, if a panel with a reasonable EDID is available, the patch replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if the resolutions don't match. Systems without a valid internal panel EDID will still use the BIOS native mode.

2. Patch implementation:
   The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_connectors.c`. It introduces logic to check if the EDID preferred mode matches the native mode and replaces the native mode with the preferred mode if the resolutions don't match. It also attempts to get native mode details from the EDID if necessary.

3. Patch review:
   The patch has been reviewed by Matthew Garrett and Alex Deucher, who have provided their signed-off-by statements, indicating their approval of the patch.

4. Impact and justification:
   The patch addresses a corner case where the BIOS native mode may not accurately represent the panel capabilities due to incomplete initialization. By allowing the panel's preferred mode to override the native mode, the patch ensures that the panel's capabilities are correctly reflected. This can improve the display experience on systems with reasonable EDID.

true || Based on the provided patch analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses two regressions caused by the move_notify changes in the nouveau driver. These regressions are considered serious, and the patch aims to fix them.

2. The first regression is caused by the move_notify() call being moved after move() has been done. This results in new_mem sometimes not being the new node, leading to a potentially stale node being accessed. The patch reverts this change and introduces a cleanup in the move() failure path instead.

3. The second regression is caused by the call to move_notify() from cleanup_memtype_use(), which passes TTM ghost objects into the driver. This can lead to accessing uninitialized memory. The patch works around this issue in the nouveau driver's move_notify() hook.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to chowning setuid files with xattrs in the reiserfs file system.

2. The patch fixes a problem where the xattr directory would have S_IFREG added to its mode bits when the setuid bit is cleared during chown.

3. The patch adds a missing IS_PRIVATE check in reiserfs_acl_chmod, which caused a double-lock to occur while holding the write lock, resulting in a locked-up file system.

4. The patch temporarily clears everything but ATTR_UID|ATTR_GID for the calls to reiserfs_setattr, ensuring that only the ownership bits are modified.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue with capping the 'capacity_now' variable to 'full_charge_capacity'. It argues that this approach is incorrect because it assumes all batteries will behave the same way, which is not the case. Good battery firmwares may allow 'capacity_now' to exceed 'full_charge_capacity' and update it when the battery is fully charged.

3. By capping 'capacity_now', accurate capacity reporting is lost until charging is complete whenever 'full_charge_capacity' needs to be increased.

4. The patch fixes the issue by removing the line that caps 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity'.

5. The patch includes the necessary metadata, such as the Fixes tag, Cc tag for stable releases, and Signed-off-by tags.

Overall, the patch seems to address a known issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by the relevant developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to prevent stacking filesystems (such as ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using procfs as the lower filesystem. It states that there is too much complexity and "magic" happening inside procfs, and there is no valid reason to stack filesystems on top of it.

The patch modifies the proc_mount function in fs/proc/root.c. It sets the s_stack_depth field of the superblock to FILESYSTEM_MAX_STACK_DEPTH, indicating that procfs is not a stacking filesystem but still preventing any stacking on top of it.

The rationale behind this change is that procfs performs access checks in VFS open handlers, and ecryptfs, for example, calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't drop privileges. This suggests that stacking filesystems on top of procfs could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

Given the reasoning provided in the patch and the potential risks associated with stacking filesystems on top of procfs, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses a potential issue where requests may be lost if a stopped queue restarts before the requests are added to the dispatch list. The patch adds a check to ensure that requests in the rq_list are not lost in such scenarios.

The added code snippet in the patch checks if the queue is stopped and restarted before the requests are added to the dispatch list. If this happens, the patch calls blk_mq_run_hw_queue() again to dispatch the requests and prevent them from being lost.

This patch improves the reliability of the block layer by preventing the loss of requests in certain scenarios. It does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: Missing update of msg_namelen for stream sockets.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the vgic-v3.c file in the virt/kvm/arm/vgic directory. It addresses an issue related to level interrupts in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

The patch introduces changes to the vgic_v3_fold_lr_state() function. Previously, when reading back from the list registers, two actions were performed for level interrupts: clearing the soft-pending bit if the interrupt is not pending anymore in the list register and resampling the line level and propagating it to the pending state.

However, the patch suggests that these two actions should not be linked, and the line level should always be resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. This is important to avoid injecting spurious interrupts that have already been retired.

The patch modifies the code to always resample the line level, irrespective of the pending state in the list register. It also clears the soft pending state when level interrupts have been acknowledged, and regenerates the pending state.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to level interrupts in the KVM subsystem and improves the accuracy of interrupt handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing redundant code that checks the resource with `devm_ioremap_resource` in multiple drivers.

2. The patch includes a test case in the form of a C program that verifies the behavior of the truncate function. It expects the truncate operation to fail with the ETXTBSY error, indicating that the file is busy.

3. The patch is reported by Aihua Zhang and signed-off by Miklos Szeredi.

4. The patch modifies the ovl_setattr function in the fs/overlayfs/inode.c file.

5. In the ovl_setattr function, if the attribute being modified is the size (ATTR_SIZE), the patch checks the writecount of the underlying inode. If the writecount is less than zero, indicating that the file is being written to, the function returns -ETXTBSY.

6. The patch then proceeds to perform the copy-up operation and modifies the upperdentry's inode attributes accordingly.

7. If the attribute being modified is the size, the patch also checks the write access on the upperdentry's inode. If write access cannot be obtained, the function returns an error.

8. Finally, the patch releases the write access on the upperdentry's inode and drops the write access on the overlay inode.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It adds a necessary check for write access on the underlying inode when truncating a file in the overlay filesystem, ensuring consistency and preventing potential issues.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it addresses a memory leak, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue introduced by commit c702418f8a2f, which removed zone watermark checks from the compaction code in kswapd but left in the zone congestion clearing. This resulted in inappropriate zone congestion clearing during higher order reclaims, which affected the reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages.

The patch proposes removing the clearing from the zone compaction section entirely. It suggests that the preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd will clear the congestion flag if the zone is considered balanced.

The rationale behind this change is to ensure that zone congestion status is only cleared when their watermarks have been restored, as intended.

The patch has been reviewed by Johannes Weiner and Rik van Riel, and it is also signed-off by Linus Torvalds.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it appears to be a valid fix for the problem. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the file `drivers/char/msm_smd_pkt.c` and removes the usage of the `IS_ERR()` function. Instead, it checks if the memory allocation function `kzalloc()` returns NULL. If it does, it prints an error message using `pr_err()`.

The change is made to improve the code by using the appropriate error handling mechanism. The `IS_ERR()` function is typically used to check if a pointer returned by a function call is an error pointer or a valid pointer. However, in this case, the `kzalloc()` function returns NULL on failure, not an error pointer.

By removing the unnecessary usage of `IS_ERR()` and directly checking for NULL, the code becomes more straightforward and easier to understand.

Considering the simplicity and correctness of the patch, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() function called from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() may cause global P-state limits to change, which is confusing and unnecessary.

2. The patch explains that in passive mode, the global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor and are not taken into account by governors when making decisions. Therefore, making the global limits follow the per-policy limits serves no purpose and may go against user expectations.

3. The patch removes the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(), reducing the code size by a few lines.

4. The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. It removes the only piece of code updating the per-CPU limits in that mode, so the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account, as expected.

5. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit (001c76f05b01) that introduced the issue.

6. The patch is signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the need for the shark_led_work function to take the v4l2 lock. It achieves this by calling cancel_work_sync(&shark->led_work) from the usb_shark_disconnect function instead of canceling the work from shark_led_work itself.

The removal of the v4l2 lock in shark_led_work suggests that the work function no longer requires exclusive access to the v4l2 device. This change could potentially improve concurrency and performance.

Additionally, the patch cancels the work using cancel_work_sync(&shark->led_work) in both usb_shark_disconnect and usb_shark_release functions. This ensures that the work is properly canceled before the device is disconnected or released.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch improves the code by removing unnecessary locking and ensuring proper cancellation of work. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

To fix this, the patch introduces a condition using the `is_power_of_2()` function to check if the value is a power of 2 before calling `rounddown_pow_of_two()`.

This change ensures that the `rounddown_pow_of_two()` function is only called when the value is non-zero and a power of 2, avoiding the undefined behavior.

The patch also includes the necessary `Cc` and `Signed-off-by` tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The late_alloc() function used by create_mapping_late() does not call pgtable_page_ctor() on PTE pages it allocates, leaving the per-page spinlock uninitialized.
   - Explanation: The late_alloc() function is responsible for PTE allocation, but it fails to initialize the per-page spinlock.
   - Impact: This can lead to a crash when the UEFI memory attributes table code is executed.

2. Crash Scenario: The crash occurs when the UEFI page tables, which are not owned by init_mm, are accessed without being covered by fully constructed struct pages.

3. Fix: The patch adds an unconditional call to pgtable_page_ctor() in late_alloc() to ensure that the per-page spinlock is properly initialized.

4. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the issue.

This is necessary because other patches in the series introduce runtime modifications to the resource tree that can occur on multiple threads. Therefore, introducing locking ensures thread safety.

2. The patch adds the `down(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` call before iterating over the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree, indicating that the lock is acquired before accessing the tree.

3. The `up(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` call is added before returning from the function, ensuring that the lock is released.

4. The patch also introduces a new variable, `retval`, to store the return value of the function. This allows for proper handling of the return value in case of failure.

5. The `goto exit` statement is used to jump to the exit label and release the lock before returning from the function.

6. The patch does not modify any existing functionality or behavior, but rather adds necessary locking to support future modifications.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch adds an additional argument, "handle_flags," to the function "break_stripe_batch_list" in the md/raid5.c file. This argument allows for more flexibility in setting the STRIPE_HANDLE flag on individual stripes when breaking a stripe_batch_list.

The patch modifies the "break_stripe_batch_list" function to check the value of "handle_flags" and conditionally set the STRIPE_HANDLE flag on stripes based on the given flags. If "handle_flags" is zero, the STRIPE_HANDLE flag is always set on non-head stripes. If "handle_flags" is non-zero, the STRIPE_HANDLE flag is set on stripes only if any of the given flags are present.

The patch also updates the "handle_stripe" function to call "break_stripe_batch_list" with the new argument, passing 0 as the value. This ensures that the STRIPE_HANDLE flag is always set when handling a stripe with the STRIPE_BATCH_ERR flag set.

Overall, the patch introduces a useful enhancement to the md/raid5 functionality by allowing more control over when the STRIPE_HANDLE flag is set. It does not introduce any potential issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch introduces changes to handle the issue correctly. It initializes the necessary variables, "p" and "ds", and modifies the logic in the SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE case.

3. The patch checks if the switchdev transaction is in the prepare phase using switchdev_trans_ph_prepare(). If it is, it checks if the driver supports port STP update using ds->drv->port_stp_update. If the driver does not support it, it sets ret to -EOPNOTSUPP. Otherwise, it calls ds->drv->port_stp_update() with the appropriate arguments.

4. For other switchdev attributes, the patch sets ret to -EOPNOTSUPP, indicating that the attribute is not supported.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch adds a call to `bnxt_qplib_free_mrw()` to deregister the memory region (MR) in the firmware before freeing the fast_reg_page_list.
2. If the deregistration of the MR fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code.
3. The patch then checks if the MR has associated pages and frees them using `bnxt_qplib_free_fast_reg_page_list()`. It also sets the `mr->npages` and `mr->pages` variables to NULL.
4. Finally, if the MR has an associated ib_umem (InfiniBand user memory), it is released using `ib_umem_release()`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where the hardware could access freed host buffers, leading to a host crash. The patch ensures that the MR is deregistered in the firmware before freeing the associated resources.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to traversing the EEH devices list in the powerpc/eeh subsystem.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the SP (Spatial Reuse Protocol) in the mac80211 subsystem. The problem occurs when a frame carrying the IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP bit is enqueued during the SP. This can prevent the SP from being closed, leading to a situation where no new SP is opened, and the client's poll frames are not responded to.

To resolve this issue, the patch manually clears the WLAN_STA_SP flag if a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU session. This ensures that even if the client does not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was identified by Alesya Shapira, and it is also signed-off by Emmanuel Grumbach and Johannes Berg, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific problem and provides a reasonable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread during suspend or hibernation. It explains that if usb-stor-scan is left freezable without actually freezing, the freezer will wait for it to exit, causing threads waiting for scanning to finish to be blocked.

2. To resolve this issue, the patch suggests using set_freezable_with_signal() instead of set_freezable() to request a fake signal when freezing. This ensures that the freezer does not wait indefinitely for usb-stor-scan to exit.

3. Additionally, the patch replaces wait_event_freezable_timeout() with wait_event_interruptible_timeout() to avoid freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread. This prevents potential issues with khubd freezing while waiting for scanning to complete.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the CPU load average increase caused by the SENSE_PORT command in the mlx4_cmd_wait function. Currently, the wait_for_completion_timeout call puts the kernel thread into the uninterruptible state, contributing to the CPU load average. 

The patch suggests using wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout instead, which puts the thread in the interruptible state, preventing it from contributing to the CPU load average. Additionally, in the case of an interrupted wait, the patch treats it as if the SENSE_PORT command returned port_type = NONE.

The fix is suggested by Gideon Naim and Bart Van Assche, who are associated with Mellanox Technologies. The patch is also signed-off by multiple developers, including David S. Miller.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a solution that improves CPU load average handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the memory_is_poisoned_16() function in the kasan.c file. The function checks if a 16-byte memory region is poisoned or not. The issue is with the last shadow judgment in the function.

The patch explains that if the memory is aligned on 8 bytes, the shadow only takes 2 bytes, and therefore, checking the first 2 bytes of the shadow is sufficient. The patch suggests removing the call to memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15) and replacing it with a check for alignment using the IS_ALIGNED macro.

The patch modifies the code to check if the address is aligned on 8 bytes using IS_ALIGNED(addr, 8) instead of checking the last byte. If the address is aligned, it returns false, indicating that the memory is not poisoned. Otherwise, it falls back to the existing logic of calling memory_is_poisoned_1(addr + 15).

The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and has been Acked by multiple developers.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. Description of the issue:
   The patch describes an off-by-one error in the continuation handling of /proc/net/route. When generating /proc/net/route, a header is emitted followed by a line for each route. If a short read is performed, the process is restarted based on the open file descriptor. However, the calculation of the start point fails to consider that the 0th entry is the header, leading to the skipping of the first entry during a continuation read.

2. Verification of the issue:
   The provided comparison demonstrates the issue by showing the discrepancy between the output of the "while read" case and the "cat" case. The first non-title element is lost in the "while read" case, and an entry around the 8K mark is missing in the "cat" case.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a deadlock issue between rmmod and set_mode functions in the IB/ipoib driver.

2. Patch details: The patch modifies the set_mode function in the ipoib_cm.c file and the ipoib_set_mode function in the ipoib_main.c file.

3. Root cause analysis: The deadlock occurs because the set_mode function locks the sys/fs lock first and then tries to lock the rtnl_lock, while the rmmod function takes the rtnl_lock first and then tries to lock the sys/fs lock. This creates a deadlock situation.

4. Patch solution: The patch modifies the set_mode function to check if ipoib_set_mode returned -EBUSY, indicating that the rtnl_lock is still held. If so, it does not unlock the rtnl_lock. This ensures that the lock is released only when ipoib_set_mode returns 0 or a value other than -EBUSY.

5. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the issue and provides the necessary information for tracking the fix.

6. Stability: The patch does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially destabilize the system. It only addresses a deadlock issue.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to resolve the deadlock issue in the IB/ipoib driver.

1. The patch aims to replace the use of VM_NO_THP and VM_BUG_ON with an actual VMA check in the mm/huge_memory.c file.

2. The issue being addressed is that khugepaged (a kernel thread responsible for collapsing transparent huge pages) cannot distinguish private /dev/zero mappings from other special mappings like /dev/hpet, which leads to false-positive VM_BUG_ON and incorrect installation of transparent huge pages (THP) where they are not expected.

3. The patch fixes this issue by checking the vm_ops field of the VMA structure. If vm_ops is present or if the VM_NO_THP flag is set, khugepaged will not work on file or special mappings.

4. The patch removes the VM_BUG_ON_VMA check for VM_NO_THP, as it is no longer necessary.

5. The patch also modifies the hugepage_vma_check function to return false if the VM_NO_THP flag is set, indicating that THP should not be used for the given VMA.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to transparent huge pages and improves the accuracy of THP installation. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses an issue where the calculation of the inode alignment mask in xfs_set_inoalignment() is incorrect when the block size is larger than the inode cluster size. This is because the call to XFS_B_TO_FSBT() returns 0 in such cases, and the xfs_sb->sb_inoalignmt is set to 0 by mkfs.xfs.

The patch proposes using xfs_icluster_size_fsb() to calculate the inode alignment mask instead. This ensures that the correct value is used for mp->m_inoalign_mask.

The patch also mentions that xfs_imap() works fine even with mp->m_inoalign_mask having -1 as the value because blks_per_cluster variable would have the value 1. This means that there is no need to use mp->m_inoalign_mask to compute the inode chunk's agbno and offset within the chunk.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a reported issue and has undergone testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: handle vce pg flags properly," indicating that it addresses a specific issue related to power-gating the VCE (Video Codec Engine) block in the AMDGPU driver.

2. The patch includes a "Reviewed-by" tag from Eric Huang, indicating that the changes have been reviewed by another developer.

3. The patch modifies the vce_v2_0_set_powergating_state() and vce_v3_0_set_powergating_state() functions in the amdgpu driver.

4. The added code checks if the pg_flags of the amdgpu_device structure contain the AMDGPU_PG_SUPPORT_VCE flag. If this flag is not set, the function returns 0, indicating that the VCE block should not be started or stopped.

5. This check ensures that the VCE block is only manipulated if power-gating support for VCE is enabled.

6. The patch also includes a comment questioning the need for calling vce_v2_0_stop() and vce_v3_0_stop() functions when the state is AMD_PG_STATE_GATE. This indicates that further investigation may be required, but it does not affect the correctness of the patch itself.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch initializes the network_header and transport_header fields in the skb structure created in vnet_rx_one() function. This is necessary for vnet_fullcsum() to correctly compute the checksum for IPv4 packets.

2. The patch first resets the network_header field using skb_reset_network_header().

3. If the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag is set in dext->flags and the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, the patch proceeds to initialize the iphdr structure pointer (iph) using ip_hdr(skb).

4. The patch sets the iph->check field to 0 and recalculates the IP checksum using ip_send_check(iph).

5. If the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag is set in dext->flags and skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE, the patch further checks if the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP.

6. If the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, the patch initializes the transport_header field using skb_reset_transport_header() and skb_set_transport_header() with the appropriate offset (ihl * 4) to point to the transport header.

7. Finally, the patch calls vnet_fullcsum() to compute the full checksum for the packet.

Overall, the patch ensures that the network_header and transport_header fields are properly initialized in the skb structure, allowing vnet_fullcsum() to correctly compute the checksum for IPv4 packets. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering the nature of the fix, which addresses a security vulnerability, it is recommended to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in the block/blk-ioc.c file. The current implementation involves double lock dancing, which can be simplified by using trylock on the queue_lock and backing out from the ioc lock on trylock failure.

The changes made in the patch involve removing the last_q variable and simplifying the lock handling. Instead of acquiring and releasing locks in a nested manner, the patch uses spin_trylock() to attempt acquiring the queue_lock. If successful, it calls ioc_exit_icq() and releases the lock. If not successful, it releases the ioc lock, performs a CPU relax, and then acquires the ioc lock again.

The patch eliminates the need for nested lock handling and reduces the complexity of the code. It also ensures that the ioc lock is released during the loop execution, preventing potential deadlocks.

Overall, the changes in the patch simplify the code and improve its readability without introducing any obvious issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where event processing for the AP interface gets delayed or not processed after a sw scan, resulting in data halt and eventual disconnection. The patch ensures that work items are requeued for all VIF types (STA, ADHOC, MESH, and AP) after the scan is complete.

The patch modifies the following files:
- net/mac80211/ibss.c: It removes the requeueing of work for ADHOC VIF types after the scan is complete.
- net/mac80211/mesh.c: It removes the function `ieee80211_mesh_notify_scan_completed` that requeues work for MESH VIF types after the scan is complete.
- net/mac80211/mesh.h: It removes the declaration of `ieee80211_mesh_notify_scan_completed`.
- net/mac80211/mlme.c: It removes the requeueing of work for STA VIF types after the scan is complete.
- net/mac80211/scan.c: It adds a loop to requeue work for all running VIF types after the scan is complete.

The patch ensures that work is requeued for all VIF types, including AP, after the scan is complete. This will prevent data halt and disconnection issues on the AP interface.

Considering the nature of the issue and the changes made by the patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the problem. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The variables `start_idx` and `end_idx` are declared as `int`, which can cause truncation of offsets larger than 1 << 44 (16TiB).
   - Impact: If `start` is below the boundary and `end` gets trimmed, the final check `if (page->index <= end_idx)` will unexpectedly fail, leading to a false return value of "there's no page in the range" even if there is at least one.
   - Consequence: This can lead to races and incorrect behavior in certain scenarios, such as hole punching and direct locking.

2. Fix: The patch proposes changing the types of `start_idx` and `end_idx` to `unsigned long` to avoid the truncation issue.

3. Importance: The bug occurrence is constrained by several factors, including the file size, the range crossing the 16TiB boundary, and the internal state of file pages and pending operations. Additionally, ordered data in the range would prevent reaching the buggy function check.

4. Impact assessment: The worst consequence of the bug seems to be stale data read, and the patch aims to prevent this issue.

Considering the importance of preventing races and ensuring correct behavior in hole punching and direct locking scenarios, and the fact that the patch addresses a specific bug with a clear fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a memory leak issue and does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the code in the `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` and `update_block_group_flags` functions in the `fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c` file. The original code added the count of missing devices to the number of writable devices to ensure that any RAID levels on a degraded file system continue to be honored. However, this approach caused a problem where new chunks could not be allocated if there were not enough writable devices available.

The patch addresses this issue by ignoring the number of missing devices when allocating new chunks. It removes the addition of `root->fs_info->fs_devices->missing_devices` from the calculation of `num_devices` in both functions.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a problem with allocating new chunks in degraded file systems and improves the behavior of the Btrfs file system in such scenarios.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch also adds error handling for the rtc_device_register function, ensuring that if it fails, the previously allocated resources are properly released.
4. The patch includes appropriate error handling and cleanup code, such as freeing the IRQ and unregistering the RTC device.
5. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by two individuals, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review.

Overall, the patch addresses a resource leak and includes proper error handling. It has also received positive reviews. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to fix a use-after-free bug in the __put_anon_vma function. The patch correctly frees the child anon_vma before freeing anon_vma->root, which resolves the issue.

Considering that the patch addresses a bug and has been Acked by Peter Zijlstra, it is likely suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the patch does not provide any additional information about the bug or its impact, so further analysis may be required to fully assess its suitability for stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix a problem related to non-existing virtual disks (VD) being exposed to the host in the megaraid_sas driver. The issue arises when the ldTgtIdToLd[] array is accessed beyond its size, resulting in valid LD values being returned for non-existing targets.

The patch addresses this issue by invalidating LD values (setting them to 0xff) in the ldTgtIdToLd[] array for device indices beyond a certain limit. This ensures that invalid LD values are returned for non-existing targets beyond that limit.

Considering the nature of the patch and the problem it addresses, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch addresses a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs file system. Currently, the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set after the inode hash table lock is dropped, which can lead to a race with the inode initialization code. This can cause issues when searching for existing inodes in the hash table.

The patch modifies the code to set the location field earlier and changes the find actor function to only use the location objectid for matching inodes. The inode hashing only requires a unique and stable test and does not need to reflect the inode numbers shown to userland.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a race condition and improves the stability of the Btrfs file system. However, further testing and review by the maintainers is necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.

Please note that the final decision should be made by the appropriate maintainers and reviewers of the Linux kernel.

2. It replaces the ssm instruction with the stosm instruction, which is faster in this context.
3. The patch introduces a new macro, ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED, which represents the enabled state of interrupts.
4. The arch_local_irq_restore function is modified to check if the flags indicate a transition from disabled to enabled interrupts. If so, it calls arch_local_irq_enable to enable interrupts.
5. The arch_irqs_disabled_flags function is modified to use the new ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED macro for checking if interrupts are disabled.
6. The patch also includes a change in arch/s390/mm/init.c, where the arch_local_irq_restore call is replaced with __arch_local_irq_stosm(0x04).

Overall, the patch seems to provide a performance improvement by using a faster instruction and optimizing the irq restore process. It also maintains the correct behavior for enabling and disabling interrupts. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

4. Solution: The patch ensures that the most recent interrupt flags are used for restoring the spinlock.
5. Fixes: The patch references the commit that introduced the issue.
6. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by the relevant developers.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a proper fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit b0d0d915, which removed the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) in the ipx module.

2. The regression causes a deadlock scenario in the mars-nwe (NetWare emulator) application, where the ncpserv process reads a request using recvmsg, forks and spawns nwconn, and then waits for new requests using a blocking recvmsg. Meanwhile, nwconn deadlocks in sendmsg on the same socket.

3. The commit b0d0d915 replaced the BKL locking with lock_sock/release_sock, but it did not handle the scenario where a blocking recvmsg would block a concurrent sendmsg.

4. The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while working with the socket data and releases it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram().

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs and has been reviewed by other developers.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a regression and addresses a deadlock scenario. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch is signed-off by reputable contributors: The patch is signed-off by Peter Zijlstra (Intel) and Ingo Molnar, both of whom are reputable contributors to the Linux kernel.

4. The patch includes a link to the original discussion: The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list, providing additional context and allowing for further review if needed.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the identified issue.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug introduced by the commit "percpu_ref: decouple switching to percpu mode and reinit" (f47ad4578461). The bug occurs when the __ref_is_percpu() function races with percpu_ref_kill() and sees the DEAD flag without the ATOMIC flag. This results in the percpu pointer being contaminated with the DEAD flag.

The proposed fix clears the flag bits before returning the percpu pointer. Instead of explicitly masking the flags, the patch tests both ATOMIC and DEAD flags together. Since DEAD implies ATOMIC, testing them together avoids the need for separate masking.

The patch includes a Signed-off-by line from the author and a Reported-and-Reviewed-by line from another contributor. It also references the commit that introduced the bug and provides a link to the patch discussion on the mailing list.

Considering the bug fix and the proper review process, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch removes a check that restricts the minimum length of GETLAYOUT requests in the nfsd/blocklayout module. The comment in the code suggests that the restriction is not in line with the specifications outlined in RFC 5661 section 18.43.3.

The patch also mentions that recent Linux clients have been sending GETLAYOUT requests with minlength less than the block size, which has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some clients.

By removing the restriction, the patch allows servers to accept GETLAYOUT requests with minlength less than the block size, aligning with the specifications in the RFC and potentially resolving the issue of indefinite hangs.

Given that the patch addresses a compatibility issue and aligns with the specifications, it seems reasonable to include it in the Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to increase the output resolution of the fam15h_power hardware monitoring driver.

2. The issue being addressed is that under high CPU load, the accumulating values in the running_avg_cap register are very low, leading to poor output resolution.

3. The patch modifies the calculation of curr_pwr_watts to preserve all the bits and improve output resolution. It shifts the tdp_limit and data->base_tdp by running_avg_range bits to the left and subtracts the running_avg_capture.

4. The patch also adjusts the scaling factor for the conversion of curr_pwr_watts to micro-Watts based on the running_avg_range.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and an Acked-by from a maintainer.

6. The changes in the patch appear to be well-justified and targeted at improving the accuracy of power measurements.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to be a valid improvement to the fam15h_power driver, and it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch addresses an issue related to the mlx5 and ipath drivers in the rdma_cm code. Currently, these drivers are unable to send correct P_Key values in GMP headers and always send using a single P_Key set during the GSI QP initialization.

The patch proposes a workaround by changing the rdma_cm code to look at the P_Key value that is part of the packet payload. This allows the code to use the inner P_Key to determine the netdev.

The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit. It also includes the "Signed-off-by" tags from the authors.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and provides a workaround until the drivers are fixed.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Based on these considerations, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the regression and prevent potential send queue overflow.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing an issue related to out-of-bounds memory accesses in the nouveau_fbcon_init() function. The patch sets the buf_align value to 4, but only if fbcon->helper.fbdev is not NULL.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Bug report: The patch is addressing a specific bug reported in the kernel bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120591). This indicates that there is a known issue that needs to be fixed.

2. Fix justification: The patch is fixing an out-of-bounds memory access issue that was introduced by a previous commit. This suggests that the patch is necessary to prevent potential crashes or other issues.

3. Code logic: The patch checks if fbcon->helper.fbdev is not NULL before setting the buf_align value. This indicates that the patch is adding a necessary condition to avoid potential null pointer dereference.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a known bug and provides a fix for a potential issue. However, further review and testing may be required to ensure the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the returned symbol rate calculation in the tda10071 driver for DVB frontends. The patch multiplies the symbol rate value by 1000 to correct the issue.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) and including it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific bug and improves the accuracy of the symbol rate calculation, which can enhance the functionality and reliability of the tda10071 driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to early controllers incorrectly reporting zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register. The ahci driver currently fabricates PORTS_IMPL based on the number of ports in these cases. However, with the new nvme controllers, there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should be honored.

The patch disables the workaround for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3. This means that for AHCI versions 1.3 and above, the fabricating of port_map from cap.nr_ports will not be performed.

The patch has been signed-off by Tejun Heo and reported-by Andy Lutomirski. It also includes relevant links and Cc's to the appropriate individuals and mailing lists.

Considering the specific issue being addressed and the fact that the patch has been reviewed and signed-off, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: a double-free bug on beacon generation failure in the ath9k driver.
2. The issue occurs when the next beacon is sent, and the ath_buf from the previous run is reused.
3. If getting a new beacon from mac80211 fails, the bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, but the skb (socket buffer) is freed.
4. This leads to a double-free on the next beacon transmission attempt, resulting in a system crash.
5. The patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting bf->bf_mpdu to NULL when the skb is freed.
6. The patch includes proper Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.
7. The patch is relatively small and focused, addressing a specific bug without introducing any significant changes or potential regressions.

Considering these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any known risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: data corruption observed during read/write stress tests in the ti-qspi driver.
2. The patch explains the root cause of the issue: writing an invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG terminates the current transfer and de-asserts the chip select. However, if spi_finalize_current_message() is called before de-asserting the chip select, the next transfer can overlap with the previous one, leading to data corruption.
3. The patch proposes a fix by moving the write of the invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG before calling spi_finalize_current_message(). This ensures that the chip select is de-asserted before scheduling the next transfer, preventing data corruption.
4. The patch includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for stable releases.
5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and the maintainer of the spi-ti-qspi driver.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and follows the necessary procedures for inclusion in stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
