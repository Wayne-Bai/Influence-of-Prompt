To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check in the `nfs_compare_remount_data` function to reject remount attempts that change the NFS version or minor version.
   - This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific behavior related to remounting NFS filesystems.

2. The patch also adds the `data->version` and `data->minorversion` assignments in the `nfs_remount` function.
   - This assigns the NFS version and minor version from the `nfsvers` and `nfss->nfs_client->cl_minorversion` variables, respectively.

3. The patch includes the `Reported-by`, `Signed-off-by`, and `Reviewed-by` tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to remounting NFS filesystems. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

The patch primarily replaces the usage of `atomic_inc` and `atomic_dec_and_test` with `rvt_get_qp` and `rvt_put_qp` functions for managing the reference counters of QPs (Queue Pairs).

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only introduces a minor code change for maintainability purposes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new function called "dpm_for_each_dev" in the power management subsystem. This function allows iterating over devices in the dpm_list and calling a provided callback function for each device.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: enable DMA for SDHI0"
   This patch aims to enable DMA for SDHI0 on the shmobile bockw board.

2. Patch content:
   - The patch adds two lines of code to the sdhi0_info structure in the board-bockw.c file.
   - The added lines specify the DMA slave IDs for the SDHI0 controller.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch enables DMA for the SDHI0 controller, which can improve performance and reduce CPU usage during data transfers.
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using variables. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch adjusts the chunk size for metadata on larger filesystems. While this change may optimize performance, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an obsoleted check in the ext4 file system code. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ath9k_hw_reset` function in the `ath9k/hw.c` file.

2. The patch adds a condition before programming the `AR_OBS` register. It checks if the MCI (Memory Controller Interface) is disabled using the `ath9k_hw_mci_is_enabled` function.

3. If the MCI is disabled, the patch writes the value 8 to the `AR_OBS` register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific behavior related to the `AR_OBS` register in the `ath9k` driver. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix since it only adds a condition to write a value to a register based on the MCI status. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves replacing a single table with two different tables. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any significant code changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding DT (Device Tree) defines for co-processor reset lines in the ARM STi platform. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a sparse warning in the `tuntap` driver. The change makes the `tun_enable_queue()` function static, which resolves the sparse warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes two unused fields from the autofs_sb_info structure. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to DMA on SoCs (System on Chips). The patch modifies the `dma_attach` function in the `brcmsmac` driver to add an offset for PCIe devices with DMA64 bus, but only when running on an SoC.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a specific optimization or adjustment for a particular hardware configuration.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ath9k driver, specifically the ath_pci_aspm_init function. It replaces direct register access with PCI Express Capability access functions to simplify the driver.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems that the patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it focuses on code simplification and using standardized PCI Express Capability accessors.

Based on the given criteria, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it does not address any critical issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a small inline wrapper for the `device_tx_status` callback of a DMA device. This change aims to make the code more compact and legible for users of this function.

However, since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "drm/i915/vlv: check port in infoframe_enabled v2"
   - The patch title suggests that it is related to the Intel i915 graphics driver for the Valley View (VLV) platform.

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off by Jesse Barnes, Rodrigo Vivi, and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch modifies the function `vlv_infoframe_enabled` in the `intel_hdmi.c` file.
   - It adds a new variable `intel_dig_port` of type `struct intel_digital_port` and initializes it with the `enc_to_dig_port` function.
   - It adds a new variable `port` and assigns it the value of `intel_dig_port->port`.
   - It modifies the return statement to check if `port` matches the port value obtained from `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK` in the register `reg`. If they match, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `val` and `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE`. Otherwise, it returns false.

4. Analysis:
   - The patch appears to add a check for the port in the `vlv_infoframe_enabled` function.
   - It ensures that the `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE` flag is returned only if the `port` matches the port value obtained from `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK`.
   - This check helps to ensure that the infoframe is enabled only for the correct port, preventing potential issues with incorrect infoframe settings.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to the infoframe handling in the Intel i915 graphics driver for the VLV platform. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect infoframe settings. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the file `net/sched/sch_generic.c` in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch adds a check for the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag in two places where the `dev->tx_queue_len` is checked.

3. In the first check, the patch adds `!(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE)` as an additional condition to enter the if statement. This means that if `dev->tx_queue_len` is non-zero and the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is not set, the code inside the if statement will be executed.

4. In the second check, the patch adds `dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE` as an additional condition to enter the if statement. This means that if `dev->tx_queue_len` is zero, or the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set, the code inside the if statement will be executed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary change to handle the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero. This change ensures that the appropriate default qdisc is attached to the network device based on the presence of the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that switches from using `module_init` and `module_exit` to `module_platform_driver` for the `gpio_ir_recv` driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant "break" statements after "goto" statements. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch adds error checking for the `dev_alloc_skb()` call in the `amsdu_to_msdu()` function. If the allocation fails, the patch breaks out of the loop, indicating a failure. This is a good practice to handle allocation failures.

2. The patch also adds error checking for the `skb_clone()` call in the `recvbuf2recvframe()` function. If the cloning fails, the patch returns `_FAIL`, indicating a failure. This ensures that the failure is properly handled.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues with unchecked allocations and adds proper error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that makes the function `hp_amp_power_on` static. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting to table-based control initialization. The patch removes the call to `snd_soc_add_codec_controls` and instead initializes the `controls` and `num_controls` fields directly in the `soc_codec_dev_ak4642` and `soc_codec_dev_ak4648` structures.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character to the end of dev_err messages. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the networking subsystem in the Linux kernel, specifically the hns (HiSilicon Network Subsystem) driver. It introduces changes to use fwnode_handle instead of device_node for device matching and retrieval.

Based on the provided patch, it seems to be addressing a specific issue related to finding and handling the device node in the hns driver. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional details such as the bug description, impact, and severity. Without this information, it is not possible to definitively say whether the patch should be accepted or not.

Therefore, based solely on the provided patch content, I cannot make a conclusive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch switches over to the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. This is a code improvement and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch removes the calculation of the shift value and the mult value, which were previously hardcoded. Instead, it calls clockevents_config() with the ced and p->rate parameters. This change simplifies the code but does not fix any real or critical bug.

3. The patch also removes the setting of max_delta_ns and min_delta_ns values and replaces it with a call to clockevents_config(). Again, this change simplifies the code but does not fix any real or critical bug.

4. The patch modifies the clockevents_register_device() call to clockevents_config_and_register(). This change registers the clock event device with additional parameters but does not fix any real or critical bug.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real or critical bug. It only simplifies the code and makes use of the newly exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the existing event handler functions with the generic data ready poll function. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather performs a code cleanup, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized variable issue in the ath9k driver. The warning message suggests that the variable "npend" may be used uninitialized in the "ath9k_has_tx_pending" function.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to undefined behavior, it should be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves initializing the "npend" variable to 0.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new function `calibration_delay_done()` with a dummy implementation. This function is used to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and can be used by architectures to stop accepting delay timer registrations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "i2c: brcmstb: use new 8 bit address helper function". This suggests that it introduces a new helper function for handling 8-bit addresses in the i2c-brcmstb driver.

2. The patch has been reviewed by Andy Shevchenko and signed-off by Wolfram Sang, indicating that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

3. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the "brcmstb_i2c_do_addr" function in the "i2c-brcmstb.c" file.

4. In the original code, the address is calculated by shifting the "msg->addr" value by 1 and then checking if the "I2C_M_RD" flag is set to determine whether to set the LSB to 1.

5. The patch replaces this calculation with a call to the "i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg" helper function, which presumably handles the address calculation in a more efficient and reliable manner.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a non-trivial fix that improves the address calculation in the "brcmstb_i2c_do_addr" function. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused variable 'neigh' from the 'dn_output()' function in the 'dn_route.c' file of the DECnet subsystem. Since the variable is assigned but not used anywhere else in the function, removing it does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch would fall under the category of a "trivial" fix, specifically a whitespace cleanup, and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds support for VB2_DMABUF in the davinci vpbe driver.
   - This indicates that the patch is adding functionality to the driver.

2. The patch modifies the `q->io_modes` field in the `vpbe_display_probe` function.
   - It adds the `VB2_DMABUF` flag to the `q->io_modes` field.

3. The `VB2_DMABUF` flag enables support for exporting buffers as DMA-BUFs.
   - This allows other subsystems or drivers to share buffers with the davinci vpbe driver using DMA-BUF.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for exporting buffers as DMA-BUFs.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a manual swapping operation with the `swap()` macro defined in `kernel.h`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability and maintainability, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing superfluous address-of operators and unneeded casts. It also updates the printk format specifier to use %p for pointers.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), and it only contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the `ioctl` function with `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. This change is specific to the `radio-bcm2048` driver and does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the variable name `PIDVEC_SIZE` to `max_items` in the `f2fs` file system's `gang_lookup_pids` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a simple renaming of a variable, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change removes a condition that is always true after a previous check. Since it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is in line with the driver-core's recommendation to use synchronous self-deletion of attributes instead of the asynchronous removal mechanism.

2. The patch removes the `sdev_store_delete_callback()` function, which was previously used as a callback for `device_schedule_callback()`. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the need for the roundabout approach.

3. The `sdev_store_delete()` function is modified to directly call `device_remove_file_self()` and then invoke `scsi_remove_device()` if the file removal is successful. This change ensures that the "delete" behavior is synchronous.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses the issue of using the deprecated asynchronous removal mechanism and improves the code by making the "delete" behavior synchronous.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial cleanup that removes an unnecessary forward declaration. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any functional issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or security enhancements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a local variable "handle" in the acpi_pci_root_add() function. This local variable is assigned the value of "device->handle" and is then used in place of "device->handle" throughout the function.

The patch itself does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a code refactoring change aimed at improving the economy of expression.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `platform_device_put` function call in the error path of `raumfeld_audio_init` function. This fix ensures that the platform device is properly released in case of an error during the `platform_device_add` call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for the McASPs on the davinci dm646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and are associated with specific IRQ numbers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

From the information provided, it seems that this patch is adding necessary interrupt resources for error recovery in the McASPs. While it may not directly fix a critical bug causing any of the mentioned issues, it is likely addressing a potential issue related to error recovery.

Considering this, the patch seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is fixing the optional DAPM route mapping in the simple-card driver. Since this fix does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for inconsistent indenting in the i915_error_state_to_str() function. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to add an option to skip sync on DMA map in the arch/avr32 folder. It mentions that the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC was not consistent across all DMA APIs in the arch/arm folder, and this change is meant to correct that for consistent behavior.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the avr32_dma_map_page() and avr32_dma_map_sg() functions in the arch/avr32/mm/dma-coherent.c file.

   In the avr32_dma_map_page() function:
   - The patch adds a condition to check if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set in the attrs parameter.
   - If the flag is not set, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA memory.

   In the avr32_dma_map_sg() function:
   - The patch adds a similar condition to check if the DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag is set in the attrs parameter.
   - If the flag is set, it skips the synchronization and continues to the next scatterlist entry.
   - If the flag is not set, it calls dma_cache_sync() to synchronize the CPU cache with the DMA memory.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a change aimed at achieving consistent behavior across DMA APIs.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

   Therefore, considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch should not be accepted (NAK) as it does not meet the required criteria.

Please let me know if you need any further analysis or clarification.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a calculation with the DIV_ROUND_UP macro. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a USB ID for the PCTV 340eSE device. This patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the name of a signal from "DE" to "DISP" in the rcar-du driver for the DRM subsystem. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change to make the code clearer.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the IRQ handler function to the i2c section. This change is not related to fixing a real and critical bug, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or addressing a security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes indentation in the `struct amdgpu_ring`, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds a check of the status_code in ERSP_IU.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by James Smart, Sagi Grimberg, and Jens Axboe.

3. Reviewed-by: The patch is reviewed by Johannes Thumshirn and Christoph Hellwig.

4. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - In the function `nvme_fc_fcpio_done`, a check is added for `op->rsp_iu.status_code`.
   - If the status_code is non-zero, the `status` variable is set to -EIO.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is adding a necessary check for the status_code in the `nvme_fc_fcpio_done` function. This check is important for error handling and can prevent potential issues related to the status of the operation.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by adding a necessary check, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing the private copy of `struct net_device_stats` in `struct port_info` and using the stats from `struct net_device` instead. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ipmmu_probe` function in the `shmobile-ipmmu.c` file.

2. The patch removes the call to `ipmmu_iommu_init` and replaces it with a return statement that calls `ipmmu_iommu_init` and returns its value.

3. The `ipmmu_iommu_init` function initializes the IPMMU IOMMU and can potentially fail.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue by not ignoring the return value of `ipmmu_iommu_init`. This suggests that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to a failure in initializing the IPMMU IOMMU.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new parameter "rw" to the function "__extent_read_full_page" in "extent_io.c". This parameter is used to specify the type of IO operation (READ or WRITE). This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch modifies the function "extent_read_full_page" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change also seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

3. The patch modifies the function "write_one_eb" to set the "rw" parameter as "WRITE" or "WRITE_SYNC" combined with "REQ_META". This change ensures that metadata IO is properly tagged and avoids priority inversion when using IO throttling cqroups. This fix addresses a potential issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.

4. The patch modifies the function "extent_readpages" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change is consistent with the previous modifications and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

5. The patch modifies the function "read_extent_buffer_pages" to pass the "rw" parameter as "READ" combined with "REQ_META" when calling "__extent_read_full_page". This change ensures that metadata IO is properly tagged and addresses a potential issue.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to metadata IO and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding initial support for the GP104 chipset in the Nouveau driver. However, the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial change as it only adds a single line to the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for distinguishing between i.MX23 and i.MX28 LRADC units in order to make the touchscreen work on i.MX23. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a specific fix for a particular hardware variant.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix default UVD context size". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the default UVD context size in the AMDGPU driver.

2. Looking at the code changes, we see that the variable "min_ctx_size" is initialized to the maximum possible value (~0) instead of 0. This variable is used to determine the minimum context size for UVD (Unified Video Decoder) operations.

3. The current code calculates the image size and adds it to the context size. However, the patch changes the initialization of "min_ctx_size" to ~0, which effectively sets it to the maximum possible value. This ensures that the correct minimum context size is calculated.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug related to the default UVD context size calculation in the AMDGPU driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential issue that could impact the functionality of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the ARM shmobile rcar-gen2 platform. It adds more register documentation and includes some changes to the register definitions and related code.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that improves documentation and makes some code changes for clarity.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch disables the centroid pixel performance optimization in the bdw driver.
   - It is a workaround for BDW Bug #1899532.
   - It includes a warning when not using preliminary hardware support.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a new definition `GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS` in `i915_reg.h`.
   - It writes the value of `GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS` to the `HALF_SLICE_CHICKEN3` register in `gen8_init_clock_gating()` function in `intel_pm.c`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific bug (#1899532) related to the bdw driver.
   - It disables the centroid pixel performance optimization, which suggests that the optimization may have caused issues.
   - The warning about preliminary hardware support indicates that the patch may not be needed for production hardware.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a real bug and does not include any trivial changes. However, it is important to consider the impact of disabling the centroid pixel performance optimization and ensure that it does not introduce any new issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new define called "DEBUG_UART_SHIFT" and removes the variable "shift" from all functions in uncompress.h. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary casting. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary operation. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds defines for exit codes in the kselftest framework. It does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues. 

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a struct in the drm/edid module. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the initialization of the 5/10MHz channel width on the ar9003 hardware in the ath9k driver. The patch moves the call to `ath9k_hw_set_rfmode()` after `ath9k_hw_process_ini()` to avoid overwriting the AR_PHY_MODE register with default values.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses an issue with channel width initialization on a specific hardware, which can impact the functionality of the driver.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly mention any of these issues, but it does fix a potential problem with channel width initialization, which can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially impact the stability of the system.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on addressing the specific issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes a kernel warning related to suspicious RCU usage in the `net/sched/cls_tcindex.c` file.
2. The warning indicates that there is a suspicious `rcu_dereference_check()` usage at line 84 of `cls_tcindex.c`.
3. The patch modifies the `tcindex_classify()` function by changing the `rcu_dereference()` call to `rcu_dereference_bh()`.
4. The `rcu_dereference_bh()` function is used to dereference an RCU-protected pointer in a bottom-half context.
5. The patch includes the necessary metadata, such as the Fixes tag, Cc, Signed-off-by, and Acked-by fields.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to RCU usage and fixes a kernel warning. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the display of the "cache" option in the /proc/mounts file for CIFS filesystems. It also deprecates the display of the "strictcache" and "directio" options as separate options.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real issue related to firmware request failure in the imx-sdma driver. It adds error messages to differentiate between the cases when platform data or device tree is used.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on improving error reporting, which is important for debugging and troubleshooting.

The issue being fixed does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it improves the clarity of error messages, making it easier to identify and resolve firmware request failures.

Considering the importance of clear error reporting and the absence of trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel panic issue caused by a recursive recovery during boot. The patch checks the state of the wl->state variable before queuing a new recovery, ensuring that the hardware is not already stopped. This fix addresses a potential critical bug that could lead to a kernel panic.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` flag in the `ip_block_status` structure accordingly.

2. The `dce_v10_0_soft_reset` function is modified to check if the `hang` flag is set before performing a soft reset. If the display is not hung, the function returns without performing the reset.

3. The `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure is updated to include the new `check_soft_reset` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a check for display hang before performing a soft reset in the AMDGPU driver. This can help prevent unnecessary resets when the display is not actually hung, improving system stability.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that can cause hangs, it can be considered a fix for a "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. This change does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the HID Wacom driver. The patch moves the report header check for the Wacom Graphire device to ensure that valid reports are not filtered out.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a specific fix for a device-specific issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "staging: lustre: fix socklnd issues found by Klocwork Insight tool"
   This patch aims to fix issues in the socklnd module of the Lustre staging driver, which were identified by the Klocwork Insight tool.

2. Issue description: "Null pointer 'best_iface' that comes from line 802 may be dereferenced at line 832."
   The patch addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the code. It ensures that 'best_iface' is not null before dereferencing it.

3. Signed-off-by: Dmitry Eremin <dmitry.eremin@intel.com>
   The patch is signed off by Dmitry Eremin, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. Intel-bug-id: https://jira.hpdd.intel.com/browse/LU-4629
   The patch is associated with an Intel bug ID, which suggests that it addresses a specific issue reported by Intel.

5. Reviewed-by: John L. Hammond <john.hammond@intel.com>, Isaac Huang <he.huang@intel.com>, Oleg Drokin <oleg.drokin@intel.com>
   The patch has been reviewed and approved by multiple reviewers from Intel, indicating that it has undergone thorough scrutiny.

6. Code changes:
   - Line 804: A comment is added to indicate that the peer passive IPs are kept up to date.
   - Line 838: A comment is added to indicate that 'best_iface' should not be null.
   - Line 840: An assertion (LASSERT) is added to ensure that 'best_iface' is not null before dereferencing it.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue and has been reviewed and approved by multiple Intel reviewers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: "gpio: tpic2810: Make tpic2810_direction_output set proper output level"
   - The title suggests that the patch aims to fix an issue related to setting the proper output level in the tpic2810_direction_output function.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - The patch has two Signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by Axel Lin and Linus Walleij.

3. Code changes:
   - The patch adds a new static function called tpic2810_set, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. We need to assume that this function is defined elsewhere in the codebase.
   - In the tpic2810_direction_output function, the patch calls the tpic2810_set function with the provided chip, offset, and value parameters.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to fix an issue related to setting the proper output level in the tpic2810_direction_output function. However, without the definition of the tpic2810_set function and additional context, it is difficult to determine the severity and impact of the bug being fixed.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without further information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing unnecessary calls to `ipset_nest_end()` in the error paths of three different files (`ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`). 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it only involves removing trivial code, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the acpi_power_meter driver that causes the kernel to crash when it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. The current code uses the BUG() macro, which triggers a kernel panic and crashes the system. The proposed patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, which generates a warning message but allows the system to continue running.

The conditions that trigger the BUG() macro suggest that there is a bug in the code, but they are not fatal. By replacing the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, the patch ensures that the kernel does not crash unnecessarily and allows the system to handle the unexpected conditions gracefully.

The patch also includes additional error handling for unexpected attribute indexes in the show_val() and show_str() functions. Instead of triggering a BUG(), the patch uses the WARN() macro to generate a warning message and returns a default value.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause the kernel to crash unnecessarily. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses an issue that can potentially lead to system instability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to make virtual_lun0 a nullio device.
   - This change suggests that virtual_lun0 should not be used for reading or writing.
   - It does not fix a bug or address any critical issue.

2. The patch is signed-off by Andy Grover and Nicholas Bellinger.
   - The sign-off indicates that the authors have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. In the code changes, the line `char buf[16];` is replaced with `char buf[] = "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1";`.
   - This change initializes the `buf` array with the value "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1".
   - It removes the previous line that initialized `buf` to an empty string and used sprintf to set "rd_pages=8".

4. The function `hba->transport->set_configfs_dev_params(dev, buf, sizeof(buf));` is called to set the configuration parameters for the device.
   - The `buf` array is passed as the parameter to set the configuration.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any significant issue. It appears to be a configuration change for virtual_lun0. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant assignment for the "gpio->da9052" variable in the "da9052_gpio_probe" function. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only staticizes some symbols in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The purpose of this change is to silence warnings about undeclared symbols.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch contains trivial changes that do not impact the functionality or stability of the kernel.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for setting a plane's rotation property from userspace in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a set_property hook for the planes in the DRM subsystem. This hook is necessary to support DRM_IOCTL_MODE_OBJ_SETPROPERTY for the rotation property. This indicates that the patch is adding functionality to handle setting the rotation property from userspace.

2. The set_property hook is set to drm_atomic_helper_plane_set_property(). This function is a helper function provided by the DRM subsystem to handle setting properties for planes. It suggests that the patch is leveraging existing infrastructure to handle the property setting.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes to the malidp_de_plane_funcs structure, which defines the functions for the plane. The set_property hook is added to this structure.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is adding a necessary functionality to support setting the rotation property for planes in the DRM subsystem. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new functionality and leverages existing infrastructure. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the error code -ENOSYS with -EOPNOTSUPP for two stub operations in the greybus audio_apbridgea driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Qualcomm's PTM v1.1 peripheral ID to the coresight-etm3x driver. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   No, this patch does not fix a bug. It adds support for a new peripheral ID.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue?
   No, this patch does not address any of these issues.

3. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, this patch does not fix any problematic issue.

4. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite
   - The patch title suggests that it is related to the staging driver for Lustre filesystem.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description states that file times should only be updated if page_mkwrite is not set.
   - It mentions that file_update_time needs to be called manually in this case.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including James Simmons and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change adds a call to file_update_time before the do-while loop in the ll_page_mkwrite function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a fix for a specific issue related to the Lustre filesystem staging driver. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or any other critical issues. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the declaration of two arrays, `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs`, to be declared as `const struct pxa_freqs`. This change indicates that these arrays are only read and not modified, which improves code clarity and potentially allows for compiler optimizations.

2. The patch also updates the `find_freq_tables()` function and its callsites to use `const struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs` instead of `struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs`. This change ensures that the `pxa_freqs` pointer is not used to modify the underlying data, which is consistent with the intention of the function.

3. Additionally, the patch updates the `pxa_cpufreq_change_voltage()` function to use `const struct pxa_freqs *pxa_freq` instead of `struct pxa_freqs *pxa_freq`. This change indicates that the function does not modify the `pxa_freq` data, improving code clarity and potentially allowing for compiler optimizations.

Overall, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses the use of const correctness, which is a good practice for improving code quality and maintainability. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros, which expand to the I2C read and write addresses, respectively. These macros are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

2. The patch replaces the macro expansion with the actual code in place.

3. The patch is signed-off by Ian Abbott and reviewed by H Hartley Sweeten.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a trivial fix that removes unnecessary macros and expands them in place. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the kernel/sched/core.c file. Let's analyze the changes made in the patch to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the enqueue_task() function calls in several places by adding the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the existing ENQUEUE_RESTORE flag. This change ensures that ENQUEUE_RESTORE always includes ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK because DEQUEUE_SAVE has already performed an update_rq_clock().

The changes made in the patch seem to be related to the scheduling of tasks and ensuring proper synchronization. It does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes do not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Based on the provided criteria, this patch does not meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver, allowing the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name. This change is important as clocks can be named differently on multiple platforms.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi and Roger Quadros. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has received approval from experts in the field.

The changes made in the patch involve modifying clock names used in the driver. These changes are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they address the issue of clock naming inconsistency, which can potentially cause build errors or other critical issues.

The patch also includes additional error handling and warning messages to handle cases where the clock names cannot be obtained. This improves the robustness of the driver and provides helpful information for debugging and fixing the device tree.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to clock naming and improves the stability and reliability of the driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch introduces a new callback function called `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio-pca953x` driver. This function is responsible for retrieving the direction of a GPIO pin. It uses the `pca953x_read_single()` function to read the register value and returns the direction of the specified GPIO pin.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the initcall_sync variants in init.h to fix build errors. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not mention any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements:
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint PCH
   - WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev)) after detecting LynxPoint LP PCH

2. The purpose of these WARN_ON statements is to generate a warning message if the condition is not met. In this case, the condition is checking whether the detected PCH is paired with an ULT CPU.

3. The WARN_ON statements indicate that if the condition is not met, it is considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a potential issue related to the pairing of LynxPoint PCH and LynxPoint LP PCH with ULT CPUs. It is not a trivial fix as it adds warnings for a critical condition that could lead to unexpected behavior or system instability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue that could potentially cause system problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the conditional logic to check for an error code instead of a success code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple code cleanup that does not address any significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and alignment. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and does not fix any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function in the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset. The function `s_vGetFreeContext` is renamed to `vnt_get_free_context`. 

Since this patch only involves a function name change and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash due to a null dereference and handles the error path cleanup by returning -ENOMEM if kzalloc fails. 

Since the patch addresses a potential crash and improves error handling, it can be considered a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "ASoC: ak4642: fixup channels_min" and it appears to address a channel mismatch issue in the ak4642 codec driver. The patch modifies the minimum number of channels for both playback and capture streams from 1 to 2.

From the patch description, it seems that the ak4642 codec does not support Mono record, while the ak4643 codec does. This patch aims to fix the channel mismatch by setting the minimum number of channels to 2 for both playback and capture streams.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a channel mismatch, which is not explicitly mentioned as a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the ethtool API usage in the virtio_net driver. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces the use of `smp_mb()` with `smp_store_mb/release()` in the `walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin()` function and `smp_store_release()` in the `walk_shadow_page_lockless_end()` function.

2. The `walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin()` function is responsible for disabling local interrupts and setting the `vcpu->mode` variable to `READING_SHADOW_PAGE_TABLES`.

3. The `smp_mb()` call in the original code ensures that the write to `vcpu->mode` is not reordered ahead of a following spte read.

4. The patch replaces the `smp_mb()` call with `smp_store_mb(vcpu->mode, READING_SHADOW_PAGE_TABLES)`. This ensures that the write to `vcpu->mode` is not reordered ahead of the spte read.

5. The `walk_shadow_page_lockless_end()` function is responsible for enabling local interrupts and setting the `vcpu->mode` variable to `OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE`.

6. The `smp_mb()` call in the original code ensures that the write to `vcpu->mode` is not reordered ahead of a following spte read.

7. The patch replaces the `smp_mb()` call with `smp_store_release(&vcpu->mode, OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE)`. This ensures that the write to `vcpu->mode` is not reordered ahead of the spte read.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a performance optimization by replacing `smp_mb()` with more specific memory barrier functions.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the `perf report` command in the Linux kernel. It adds information about an optional `print_limit` argument for the `--call-graph` option.

Since this patch only affects the documentation and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug related to the deletion of queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch uses the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues. This change ensures that the controller returns an invalid queue identifier error to commands if a queue wasn't created.

3. The patch has been reported by Saar Gross and signed-off by Keith Busch.

4. The patch has also been reviewed by Christoph Hellwig and signed-off by Jens Axboe.

5. The code changes in the patch involve modifying the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function.

6. The variable `queues` is introduced to store the value of `dev->online_queues - 1`.

7. The loop in the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function iterates twice, with `pass` being the loop counter.

8. The variable `sent` is initialized to 0, and `i` is initialized to `queues`.

9. The `reinit_completion` function is called to reset the completion object `dev->ioq_wait`.

10. The `retry` label indicates a retry point in the loop.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to queue deletion in the NVMe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch that converts the blackfin driver to use the 64-bit get/set time methods. This change is necessary for the driver to be ready for the year 2038, as it mentions the use of a 64-bit nanoseconds register.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to time handling and ensures compatibility for future dates, it can be considered as a fix for a potential "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a lengthy expression with a more readable macro. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the bcm-kona GPIO driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds two new functions: `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` and `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown`. These functions are responsible for locking and unlocking the hardware IRQ associated with the GPIO line.

2. The `bcm_gpio_irq_chip` structure is updated to include the new `irq_startup` and `irq_shutdown` function pointers, which will be used to handle the startup and shutdown of the IRQ.

3. The `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` function locks the hardware IRQ using the `gpio_lock_as_irq` function. If the lock fails, it logs an error message.

4. The `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown` function unlocks the hardware IRQ using the `gpio_unlock_as_irq` function.

5. The patch does not introduce any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real issue related to locking and unlocking the hardware IRQ for the bcm-kona GPIO driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially prevent build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call initializes the "icount" structure to zero, but since the structure is allocated using kzalloc, it is already zeroed out. Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the soc_camera driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for reading from the video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix, so it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

2. The patch also adds a debug line, which is not a critical issue but can be useful for debugging purposes. However, it is considered a trivial change and does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

3. The patch checks if the camera bus driver supports the "init_videobuf2" operation and if the video device can be read in VB2_READ mode. If both conditions are met, it calls the "vb2_read" function to read from the video device. This is a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix.

4. If the camera bus driver does not support reading or the conditions are not met, the patch returns -EINVAL, indicating that the camera device read is not implemented. This is not a critical bug, but rather a limitation of the driver.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it contains trivial changes such as the debug line and functional enhancements rather than bug fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() in the rcutorture test. This change aims to test the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an important issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch does not fix a bug or address an issue in the Linux kernel itself. Instead, it modifies the rcutorture test to include interrupt disabling during the call_rcu() invocation. While this change may be useful for testing purposes, it does not fix a real bug or address a critical issue in the kernel.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a compile issue with a variable not being initialized in the obd_mount.c file of the Lustre staging driver. 

Since this patch addresses a build error, it can be considered a real and critical bug. However, it does not seem to cause any oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, it may not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check that is not doing anything useful. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the spi-armada-3700 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add a handler function for the Periodic Inquiry command complete event in the Bluetooth subsystem. However, without further details about the bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine its significance or criticality.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix. Specifically, I would need to know if the bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more details about the bug or issue that this patch is addressing, and any other relevant information, so that I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to make the OVSP_LOCAL constant in the openvswitch.h header file a 32-bit value instead of a 16-bit value. The justification for this change is that OVS ports are now 32-bit, so OVSP_LOCAL should also be 32-bit.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that only changes the size of a constant value.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless initialization of the variable 'ret'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ath9k wireless driver and specifically updates the AR9485 initvals. The change made is in the values of certain registers in the ar9485_1_1_baseband_postamble array.

Looking at the specific change made in the patch, it modifies the value of a register at address 0x0000a2c4 from 0x00158d18 to 0x00058d18. This change seems to be a specific value adjustment.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this change addresses a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, it is not clear if this change is a trivial fix or a significant modification.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed and its impact, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until more information is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a kmalloc() call with kzalloc(). However, the patch also removes two memset() calls that were previously used to zero out memory. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it contains trivial changes (removing memset()), I would classify it as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: OMAPDSS: HDMI: Handle panel init error at probe
   - The patch title suggests that it addresses an issue related to handling panel initialization errors during probe.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description mentions that blind assumptions about panel initialization should not be made.
   - It also states that mutex initialization should be grouped at a single place.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 60: A new member 'lock' is added to the 'hdmi_ip_data' structure.
   - Line 1056: The 'lock' member of 'hdmi_ip_data' structure is initialized using 'mutex_init'.
   - Line 1083: The 'lock' member of 'hdmi_ip_data' structure is initialized again using 'mutex_init'.
   - Line 1094: The 'hdmi_panel_init' function is called, and if it returns an error, an error message is printed, and the function returns the error code.

4. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses the issue of blindly assuming panel initialization, which suggests that there might have been cases where panel initialization errors were not handled properly.
   - The addition of the 'lock' member to the 'hdmi_ip_data' structure and its initialization ensures proper synchronization.
   - The patch also adds error handling for the 'hdmi_panel_init' function, printing an error message and returning the error code if initialization fails.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to handling panel initialization errors during probe. It also improves synchronization by grouping mutex initialization. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the Intel graphics driver. It includes changes to the initialization and cleanup of plane state for the Intel display.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to address some issues related to plane state management. Specifically, it updates the plane state during initialization and also clears the plane state during cleanup.

The changes made in the patch do not seem to fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, they appear to be related to improving the accuracy of the plane_mask and updating the plane state during initialization and cleanup.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch could be considered as relatively trivial fixes.

Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve moving some functions from the codec driver to the component driver, which does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that modifies the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions in `net/mac802154/iface.c`. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that only cleans up the code by changing the way the `open_count` variable is incremented and decremented.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the use of WARN_ON() in the srpt_abort_cmd() function in the ib_srpt.c file.

2. The current code uses WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state"), which is not the recommended usage of WARN_ON(). While it will work, the intent is not obvious.

3. The patch replaces the existing WARN_ON() with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state). This change makes the warning more useful by showing the "state" value.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue by improving the clarity and usefulness of the warning message. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential bug that could lead to unexpected command states. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the __must_check attribute to the declarations of two functions in the dvb-usb driver. This attribute is used to indicate that the return value of the function must be checked by the caller.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces deprecated operations with their recommended counterparts. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix a bit toggling issue in the ixgbe driver for the 82599 network card. The current code does not toggle the correct bit to reset the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, including Don Skidmore, Phil Schmitt, Aaron Brown, and David S. Miller.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the ixgbe_reset_pipeline_82599 function in the ixgbe_82599.c file. Specifically, it updates the AUTOC register by toggling the LMS[2] bit and Restart_AN.

4. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to resetting the data pipeline on Restart_AN assertion for the 82599 network card. This issue could potentially lead to data corruption or other critical problems.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new variable `net` of type `struct net` to store the network namespace associated with the input device.

2. The patch initializes the `net` variable with the network namespace of the input device `skb->dev` using the `dev_net()` function.

3. The patch updates the `IP_INC_STATS()` function calls to use the `net` variable instead of `dev_net(rt->dst.dev)` and `dev_net(skb_dst(skb)->dev)`. This ensures that the correct network namespace is used for statistics incrementation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a code improvement that ensures the correct network namespace is used for statistics incrementation.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the function `CsrUInt16ToHex` from `csr_util.c` to `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`. The function itself is not modified, and there is no indication that it fixes any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It should be rejected (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch modifies the function `btrfs_add_nondir` to take `struct btrfs_inode` instead of `struct inode` as arguments. However, there is no indication that this change addresses any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a definition for the MAC_SM_RST register value, which represents the reset bit of the MAC status machine register.

2. In the `r6040_init_mac_regs` function, the patch replaces the hardcoded value `2` with the newly defined `MAC_SM_RST` value when writing to the MAC_SM register. This ensures that the reset bit is correctly set.

3. Similarly, in the `r6040_mac_address` function, the patch replaces the hardcoded value `2` with the `MAC_SM_RST` value when resetting the internal state machine.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the incorrect value used for resetting the MAC status machine. This bug could potentially cause issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new flag `V4L2_TUNER_CAP_1HZ` for 1 Hz resolution in the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a recommended alternative. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "perf probe: Free perf_probe_event in cleanup_perf_probe_events()". It suggests that the patch aims to free resources related to a perf probe event in the cleanup_perf_probe_events() function.

2. The patch description mentions that the cleanup_perf_probe_events() function currently only frees resources in trace probe events and not in perf probe events. Therefore, the patch proposes to call clear_perf_probe_event() to free resources in perf probe events as well.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Wang Nan <wangnan0@huawei.com>.

4. It is signed-off by Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a necessary change to add the "dma_dir" parameter to the alloc memop in the vb2_queue_cancel function. This change is required for the next patch that needs to know the dma_dir for the dma-sg alloc memop.

The patch modifies multiple files, including videobuf2-core.c, videobuf2-dma-contig.c, videobuf2-dma-sg.c, and videobuf2-vmalloc.c. It introduces the "dma_dir" parameter to the vb2_dc_alloc, vb2_dma_sg_alloc, and vb2_vmalloc_alloc functions in these files.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds some informational print statements to the simplefb driver. The added code does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix that includes spelling changes and informational print statements. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unnecessary call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The patch mentions that the IRQ is allocated with `devm_request_irq`, indicating that the IRQ is managed by the device model and does not need to be explicitly freed.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an issue related to unnecessary freeing of an IRQ, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It specifically removes the call to `free_irq`, which can be seen as a non-trivial change.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-trivial fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect checks of power state bits in the ALSA VIA driver. The patch correctly addresses the issue by shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect power state checks, which can cause various issues such as audio malfunctions or system instability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add variable resolution support to the gspca driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the ability for subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions, which suggests that it introduces new functionality related to resolution handling.

2. The try_fmt function is called in the try_fmt_vid_cap function, passing the original resolution to the subdriver. This indicates that the patch modifies the behavior of the try_fmt function.

3. The vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function sets the current mode to ret and updates the pixfmt variable accordingly. If the subdriver has a try_fmt function, it sets the pixfmt to the modified format parameters.

4. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function checks if the subdriver has an enum_framesizes function and calls it, returning its result. This suggests that the patch introduces the ability to enumerate supported frame sizes.

5. The patch also adds two new function pointers, cam_format_op and cam_frmsize_op, to the sd_desc structure in gspca.h. These function pointers are used by the gspca driver to call the try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions in the subdriver.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch adds important functionality related to variable resolution support and frame size enumeration. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new behavior and modifies existing functions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __dev* attributes. This change is related to the removal of the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option and does not fix any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a checkpatch.pl warning about a line being over 80 characters. This type of fix falls under the category of "trivial" and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming an enum. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change that improves the display of vendor information for imported USB devices.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices. The patch adds a new rate_update hook and modifies the rs_rate_init function to re-initialize the rate scaling when a remote station changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly address any of these issues. It is more of a functional improvement rather than fixing a critical issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a new hook and modifies the rate initialization function.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves removing redundant code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the HDMI PLL reset. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch replaces the existing code block:
   ```c
   inode_lock(parent->d_inode);
   tmp = lookup_one_len(nbuf, parent, strlen(nbuf));
   inode_unlock(parent->d_inode);
   ```
   with the new code:
   ```c
   tmp = lookup_one_len_unlocked(nbuf, parent, strlen(nbuf));
   ```

2. The new code uses the `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function instead of the previous `lookup_one_len()` function. This change suggests that the patch aims to address a potential issue related to locking.

3. The patch includes a comment explaining the logic when `tmp` is not equal to `dentry`:
   ```c
   /*
    * Somebody has renamed it since exportfs_get_name();
    * great, since it could've only been renamed if it
    * got looked up and thus connected, and it would
    * remain connected afterwards.  We are done.
    */
   ```

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch improves the code by using the `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function and provides a clear explanation of the logic when `tmp` is not equal to `dentry`. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if the patch addresses a critical issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation of the bug being fixed and its impact on the system before making a final decision on whether to accept or reject the patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the physical address information to the vm_struct for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix potential issues related to NULL pointer handling in the bcm2835-audio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch replaces NULL return values from `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it provides more specific information about the failure reason. The error pointer values returned are `-EINVAL` for too many instances of audio service, `-ENOMEM` for kzalloc failure, and `-EPERM` for vchi connections failure to open.

2. The patch also replaces a NULL check with `IS_ERR(..)` where `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is called. This change ensures that the error pointer values are properly handled.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues related to NULL pointer handling and improves error reporting in the bcm2835-audio driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be removing unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

Since the patch is removing unused code and does not fix any real or critical bug, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the way the DRM_MINOR_* constants are defined. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "s390/vmur: Link parent CCW device during UR device creation." It suggests a modification to the code related to the creation of virtual unit record (UR) devices on the s390 architecture.

2. Patch Details: The patch modifies the code in the `ur_set_online` function in the `vmur.c` file. Specifically, it changes the `device_create` function call by adding the parent CCW device (`cdev->dev`) as the second argument.

3. Analysis: Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. The patch description and details do not provide enough context to make a definitive determination.

4. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Given the lack of information about the bug being fixed and its criticality, it is difficult to make a conclusive decision. However, based on the provided information, it seems more likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further details are provided to demonstrate its significance and criticality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command in the Linux kernel. This option allows for explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. The patch also includes changes to the "perf" tool's documentation and code to support this new option.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, let's check if the patch fixes a real and critical bug. From the patch description, it seems that this patch is not fixing a bug but rather adding a new feature to the "perf record" command. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a bug.

Next, let's consider if the patch addresses any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Since this patch is adding a new option and modifying the code to support it, it is less likely to introduce build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine if it addresses any real security issues.

Lastly, let's check if the patch contains any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. From the provided patch, it does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add debug error messages to report command timeout in the liquidio driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a timeout error message in the function `lio_process_ordered_list()` in the liquidio driver. This indicates that there is a potential issue with command timeouts in the driver.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the function `if_cfg_callback()`. This provides additional information about the failure status when the NIC configuration instruction fails.

3. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors.

4. The changes made in the patch do not seem to be trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They address real issues related to command timeouts and failure status reporting.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses real and critical issues related to command timeouts and failure status reporting in the liquidio driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant use of the of_match_ptr() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming variables and converting enums into defines. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a constify patch, which means it is making the of_device_id arrays const. This change is in line with the requirement of not containing any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

The patch itself is modifying three different files: mxc_w1.c, omap_hdq.c, and w1-gpio.c. In each file, the of_device_id array is being changed from non-const to const.

Since this patch is not fixing any real and critical bugs, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: "drm/i915/skl: Allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP"
   - The patch aims to allow the reg_read ioctl to return RCS_TIMESTAMP in the drm/i915/skl driver.

2. Reviewed-by: Rodrigo Vivi <rodrigo.vivi@intel.com>
   - The patch has been reviewed by Rodrigo Vivi, an Intel employee.

3. Signed-off-by: Damien Lespiau <damien.lespiau@intel.com>
   - The patch has been signed off by Damien Lespiau, an Intel employee.

4. Signed-off-by: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>, drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_uncore.c

5. Code Changes:
   - In the file intel_uncore.c, at line 968, there is a change in the whitelist array.
   - The original line: { RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE), 8, GEN_RANGE(4, 8) }
   - The modified line: { RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE), 8, GEN_RANGE(4, 9) }
   - The change modifies the gen_bitmask range from 4-8 to 4-9.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a trivial fix that modifies a whitelist range in the intel_uncore.c file. It does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function `nouveau_abi16` which is a locked variant of `nouveau_abi16_get`. This suggests that the patch is addressing a critical bug or issue related to accessing ABI16 data.

2. The patch modifies the existing `nouveau_abi16_get` function to use the new `nouveau_abi16` function. This change ensures that the client mutex is locked before accessing the ABI16 data.

3. The patch also adds a check in the `nouveau_abi16_get` function to return `NULL` if `nouveau_abi16` fails. This indicates that the patch is handling potential error scenarios.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these observations, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to accessing ABI16 data and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only changes the way the channel is set in the atusb_channel() function, replacing a call to atusb_write_reg() with atusb_write_subreg(). This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the behavior or functionality of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing helper function `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to obtain the block size of an ahash algorithm. This does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the `fib_table_lookup` function in the `net/ipv4/fib_trie.c` file. It changes the calculation of the `mp` variable, which is used later in the code.

The patch includes a comment stating that `fls(x) = __fls(x) + 1`. This comment suggests that using `__fls()` instead of `fls()` would be faster, assuming the argument `x` is non-null.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate this patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug?
   - No, the patch does not address a bug explicitly. It appears to be an optimization.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   - No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue?
   - No, the patch does not address a security issue.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - No, the patch does not address any problematic behavior.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the mx2-emmaprp driver. The patch adds the missing mutex_destroy() calls when the driver is removed, ensuring that the mutexes are properly cleaned up.

Since this patch fixes a potential resource leak and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. The patch clears the link status when the interface is down, preventing the driver from issuing a get statistics command when the interface is not operational.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue by preventing the driver from attempting to retrieve statistics when the interface is down.

Given that the patch does not fix a critical bug and contains a relatively trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. It makes changes to the l2cap_sock.c and l2cap_core.c files.

Looking at the changes made in l2cap_core.c, it removes code that checks for backlog size before creating a new connection. This change seems to remove a check for a potential issue related to the backlog being full. Removing this check could potentially lead to a situation where the backlog becomes full, causing a critical issue.

In l2cap_sock.c, the patch adds code to check for backlog size before creating a new connection. This addition ensures that the backlog is not full before creating a new connection, preventing potential issues.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch fixes a potential issue related to the backlog being full, which could lead to critical problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the function signature of `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the `ceph_osdc_build_request()` function call to a different location within the code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Gemini Lake platform to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake platform by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the `intel_pstate_cpu_ids` array.

2. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is adding support for a new platform, which is not considered a critical bug.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new advertising setting in the Bluetooth subsystem. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature or enhancement.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch extends the frequency range for ATSC support in the Si2157 tuner.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Olli Salonen and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner in the si2157_ops structure. It changes the frequency_min value from 110000000 to 55000000.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch fixes a real issue by extending the frequency range for ATSC support in the Si2157 tuner. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any potential issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes the '0x' notation when using the %pad format. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes forward declarations of the "struct super_block" in multiple files. Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial forward declarations, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add missing L2 cache events and DTLB refills for the ARM64 architecture. This patch does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is related to ext4 crypto policies and their application on directories.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

3. The patch modifies the function `ext4_process_policy` in the file `fs/ext4/crypto_policy.c`.

4. The added code checks if the inode is a directory before applying the encryption policy. If the inode is not a directory, it returns an error (-EINVAL).

5. The check for directory type before applying the encryption policy seems reasonable, as encryption policies should only be set on directories.

6. The patch also checks if the inode has an encryption context. If it doesn't, it further checks if the directory is empty. If the directory is not empty, it returns an error (-ENOTEMPTY). Otherwise, it creates an encryption context from the policy.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a potential issue where encryption policies were being applied to non-directory inodes. This could be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue, as it violates the intended behavior of encryption policies. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "ARM: mxc: audmux-v2: add clk_prepare/clk_unprepare" and states that it is for migrating to the generic clk framework API.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Richard Zhao and Sascha Hauer.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the audmux_read_file() and mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port() functions in the arch/arm/plat-mxc/audmux-v2.c file.

4. Changes in audmux_read_file(): The patch replaces the calls to clk_enable() and clk_disable() with clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare() respectively. This change ensures that the clock is properly prepared before enabling it and properly disabled and unprepared after use.

5. Changes in mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port(): Similar to audmux_read_file(), the patch replaces the calls to clk_enable() and clk_disable() with clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare() respectively. This ensures proper preparation and cleanup of the clock.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is a migration to the generic clk framework API and introduces necessary changes to ensure proper clock handling. However, it does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue. It seems to be more of an improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a local variable and using a helper function to validate trigger arguments. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for a special WHEA _OSC call to turn on APEI firmware first mode explicitly on some machines.
2. It includes a new function called "apei_osc_setup" in the "apei-base.c" file, which sets up the WHEA _OSC call.
3. The function "apei_osc_setup" initializes a context structure and calls "acpi_run_osc" to execute the WHEA _OSC call.
4. If the WHEA _OSC call is successful, the function frees memory and returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -EIO.
5. The patch also adds a call to "apei_osc_setup" in the "ghes.c" file during initialization.
6. Depending on the return value of "apei_osc_setup" and the value of a flag, different informational messages are printed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds necessary functionality to enable APEI firmware first mode on certain machines. This mode is crucial for hardware error notification. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for increasing the scan timeout in the iwlwifi driver. The change increases the timeout from 7 seconds to 15 seconds to avoid aborting a scan that may take longer than expected.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to scan timeouts, it can be considered a critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace modifications.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK hack in the Linux kernel's scheduler. The patch introduces a new attribute, attr::sched_flags, to properly handle the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.

Analyzing the patch, it seems to address a real issue related to the handling of the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag. This flag ensures that a process is reverted back to the SCHED_NORMAL policy on fork. The patch replaces the use of high bits nonsense with the new attr::sched_flags field, making the code more maintainable and readable.

The patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" situation, as it improves the handling of the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a critical bug and does not introduce any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). The patch itself does not provide any specific details about fixing a real and critical bug or addressing any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

The patch appears to add a new variable named "neg_one" to the sysctl.c file, but the purpose or significance of this addition is not explained. Additionally, the patch does not include any explanation or justification for why this change is necessary or how it addresses any specific problem.

Without further context or information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a conversion from the legacy SKB paged frag API to the newer SKB frag API. This type of patch typically falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it involves code cleanup and does not address any real or critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch seem to be related to fixing erroneous defines and adding new defines for reset pin controls.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the shmobile_init_delay() function in the ARM shmobile platform. The bug is related to device node reference leakage caused by the use of of_find_compatible_node() function, which returns a new reference to the found node without releasing the previous reference.

The patch proposes a solution by simplifying the code and replacing the of_find_compatible_node() calls with of_device_is_compatible(). This change reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(1) and ensures that the device node references are properly managed.

The patch also includes proper Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch fixes a real bug that can potentially cause issues in the shmobile platform, and it does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to modify the cache push and clear code for the ColdFire architecture with MMU enabled. The patch includes changes to flush the branch cache on the write-through cache setup of the ColdFire V4e with MMU enabled.

1. Patch title: "usb: gadget: net2280: reset sequence number on ep enable"
   - The patch aims to reset the sequence number on endpoint enable to stay in sync with the host.

2. Patch description:
   - It mentions that the sequence number can be out of sync if the endpoint is disabled after some data transfers and enabled again.
   - The patch proposes to reset the sequence number to ensure synchronization with the host.

3. Tested-by: Ricardo Ribalda Delgado <ricardo.ribalda@gmail.com>
   - The patch has been tested by Ricardo Ribalda Delgado.

4. Signed-off-by: Mian Yousaf Kaukab <yousaf.kaukab@intel.com>
   - The patch is signed-off by Mian Yousaf Kaukab.

5. Signed-off-by: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>, drivers/usb/gadget/udc/net2280.c
   - The patch is also signed-off by Felipe Balbi, specifying the affected file.

6. Code changes:
   - The patch adds a new function `ep_clear_seqnum` to clear the sequence number.
   - In the `net2280_enable` function, the `ep_clear_seqnum` function is called if the device has the `PLX_SUPERSPEED` quirk.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a potential synchronization issue with the host when enabling the endpoint. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new function and modifies the existing code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply migrates the jazz driver to a new 'set-state' interface provided by the clockevents core, without providing any set-state callbacks.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves a migration to a new interface without any functional changes, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rt2x00: rt2800pci: fix AUX_CTRL register setup for RT3090/3390/3593/5592". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for specific RT2X00 wireless chips.

2. The patch references the functions "rt28xx_init" in "common/rtmp_init_intf.c" and "RTMPInitPCIeLinkCtrlValue" in "os/linux/rt_rbus_pci_drv.c". These references indicate that the patch is modifying the initialization process of the rt2800pci driver.

3. The patch modifies the "rt2800pci_init_registers" function in "drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2800pci.c". Specifically, it adds additional conditions to enable PCIe wakeup for certain RT2X00 wireless chips (RT3090, RT3390, RT3572, RT3593, RT5390, RT5392, and RT5592) if the device is using PCIe.

4. The changes made in the patch involve reading the current value of the AUX_CTRL register, setting specific fields related to PCIe wakeup, and writing the modified value back to the register.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for certain RT2X00 wireless chips when using PCIe. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the initialization process and adding conditions for specific chipsets.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to register setup and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The change made in the patch is to fix an off-by-one error in the loop condition, which avoids an unnecessary delay in the final iteration of the loop.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by replacing "if (foo == false)" with "if (!foo)". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change and whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `freezable_schedule_timeout_killable()` function in the PM/Freezer subsystem. The patch correctly modifies the function to return the value from `schedule_timeout_killable()` instead of `freezer_count()`. 

Since the current callers of this function ignore the return code, the bug is considered harmless. However, the patch is still worth applying to ensure correctness and maintain consistency.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to the ACPICA disassembler. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds warnings for unresolved control methods in the ACPICA disassembler. This indicates that the disassembler was unable to determine the number of arguments to parse for the method invocation. Unresolved control methods can potentially lead to build errors, oops, or data corruption, making it a critical bug.

2. The patch includes changes to multiple files: acglobal.h, aclocal.h, and utglobal.c. These changes seem to be related to adding necessary variables and structures to track unresolved control methods.

3. The added structure "acpi_external_list" in aclocal.h includes a new field "resolved" to track whether a control method has been resolved or not.

4. In utglobal.c, the patch initializes the newly added variables "acpi_gbl_num_external_methods" and "acpi_gbl_resolved_external_methods" to zero.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to unresolved control methods in the ACPICA disassembler. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for 1080p capture at 2 fps and 5 fps to webcam emulation in the vivid driver. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is modifying the return parameters of the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management code. It ensures that the same address type passed to the command is also returned in the response message.

While this patch improves consistency, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively minor and do not seem to have a significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unreachable code. The only change made is the removal of the pr_debug() statement, which is indicated to never be executed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes an issue where "byPacketType" is not set at all.
2. The patch changes the code to set "byPacketType" by calling "CARDbyGetPktType".
3. It also changes the function "CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate" to check "basic_rates" instead of "wBasicRate".

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the "byPacketType" variable not being set. It also modifies the "CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate" function to use the correct variable for checking basic rates.

However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the changes made.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Further investigation and clarification are needed to determine if the bug being fixed is critical and meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch introduces a new helper function called `sk_stream_is_writeable()` which is used to replace a hardcoded condition in several call sites. The purpose of this change is to accommodate the upcoming support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will modify the condition for TCP sockets.

The patch itself does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue related to writeability of sockets, which can have implications on the overall stability and performance of the system.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `cancel_delayed_work()` and `cancel_work_sync()` with `cancel_delayed_work_sync()`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the DRM/i915 driver. Additionally, there is a small refactoring for gen2 using the for_each_pipe macro. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch does not explicitly mention fixing a bug, but it adds support for CRC interrupts, which can help in detecting and debugging issues related to display corruption. While not mentioned explicitly, this can be considered a fix for a potential bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues. It appears to be adding a new feature and making a small refactoring. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch filters out no-op frontbuffer tracking flushes, which is not directly related to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: drm/amdgpu: prevent get_user_pages recursion
   - The patch title suggests that it aims to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages function.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the amdgpu_ttm_tt structure to include a spinlock and a list to track tasks inside the get_user_pages function.
   - It adds a new struct amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list to store the task_struct and list_head.
   - The patch introduces changes to the amdgpu_ttm_tt_pin_userptr function to add and remove tasks from the guptasks list using the new spinlock.
   - It also modifies the amdgpu_ttm_tt_affect_userptr function to check if the current task is already in the guptasks list before allowing access.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a potential issue of recursion in the get_user_pages function by introducing a spinlock and a list to track tasks.
   - It ensures that the same task does not recursively call the get_user_pages function.
   - The changes seem to be focused on preventing potential issues rather than fixing a specific bug or security vulnerability.
   - The patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.
   - It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "nice to have" improvement rather than a critical fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicated "const" keyword. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch is making the functions `__mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del()` and `__mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_add()` symmetric, but it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf in the dw-mipi-dsi driver.

2. The patch changes the type of tx_buf from u16 to u8, which avoids the out-of-bounds read issue.

3. The patch also introduces a new variable, "data," which is used to explicitly encode the endianness of the tx_buf data.

4. The patch then checks the length of the tx_buf and sets the data variable accordingly.

5. If the tx_len is greater than 2, an error message is printed, and the function returns -EINVAL.

6. Finally, the patch uses the data and msg->type to generate the packet header value and calls dw_mipi_dsi_gen_pkt_hdr_write().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug by avoiding an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf and explicitly encoding the endianness. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "tcp: Validate route interface in early demux" and is signed-off by David S. Miller. It modifies the tcp_v4_early_demux function in the net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c file.

The patch introduces a new variable "dev" of type struct net_device and assigns it the value of skb->dev. It then uses this variable to check if the route interface matches the incoming interface index before setting the skb destination.

Based on the provided code, it appears that the patch aims to validate the route interface in the early demux process to avoid violating reverse path filtering.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate this patch:

Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is fixing a bug related to the port offset for DMEM registers in the drm/nouveau/falcon driver. It updates the register offsets used for reading and writing data to the DMEM registers.

The changes made in the patch seem to address a specific issue related to the port offset calculation. It modifies the register offsets used in the nvkm_falcon_wr32 and nvkm_falcon_rd32 functions by multiplying the port value by 8 instead of 16. This change ensures that the correct offset is used when accessing the DMEM registers.

The patch also includes some comments explaining the purpose of the code and the reason for masking the last word when the size is not a multiple of 4.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior in the driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the value of GEN6_RP_DOWN_TIMEOUT from hexadecimal to decimal and reorders the register writes.

   The patch does not mention any of these issues explicitly. However, it is related to the proper functioning of GTT tracking, which can impact system stability and performance if not handled correctly.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It specifically addresses the issue at hand.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to GTT tracking on SNB architecture and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of a variable from `phys_t` to `phys_addr_t`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with the DAPM widget IO operations in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the component mutex is held during these operations, which helps prevent potential race conditions and ensures proper synchronization.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a code improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where a NULL platform data pointer is not properly handled in the ramoops_probe function. This check ensures that the driver correctly sets up a probe request and defines the platform_data structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a defensive programming measure to handle a potential incorrect driver setup.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid CamelCase naming convention. This is a trivial fix and does not fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

2. The patch is signed-off by Leo Kim, Tony Cho, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. The patch modifies the `struct scan_attr` definition by renaming `pfScanResult` to `result`.

4. The patch modifies the `Handle_Scan` function by updating the assignment of `pfUserScanResult` to `result` in the `strWILC_UsrScanReq` structure.

5. The patch modifies the `host_int_scan` function by updating the assignment of `pfScanResult` to `result` in the `scan_info` structure.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only contains a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of `dcache_readdir` to `iterate_shared` in multiple file operations structures (`spufs_context_fops`, `autofs4_root_operations`, `autofs4_dir_operations`, and `simple_dir_operations`).

2. The change is made to avoid locking the directory in `dcache_dir_lseek` since per-struct file exclusion is considered sufficient.

3. The patch is signed-off by Al Viro and is specific to the `arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs/inode.c`, `fs/autofs4/root.c`, and `fs/libfs.c` files.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code optimization or improvement.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect error message in the ext4_ext_insert_index function.
2. The error message currently refers to "logical" and "ei_block," which is incorrect.
3. The patch updates the error message to correctly refer to "eh_entries" and "eh_max."
4. The patch is signed off by the author and the maintainer.

This patch addresses a bug in the code that could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation of error messages. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds spaces around the '>>' operator to comply with the checkpatch tool's preference. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves some deallocations from the `regulator_unregister` function to the `regulator_dev_release` function. This is done to utilize the class device lifetime management features more effectively.

2. In the `regulator_dev_release` function, the patch adds two deallocations:
   - `kfree(rdev->constraints)` frees the memory allocated for `rdev->constraints`.
   - `of_node_put(rdev->dev.of_node)` releases the reference to the device tree node.

3. In the `regulator_unregister` function, the patch removes the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and the release of the device tree node.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code cleanup and optimization change.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE entry for the of_device table in the palmas.c file. This change does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the rbd_header_from_disk() function in the rbd.c file.
2. The bug could potentially lead to an overflow if the snap_count value is too large.
3. The patch introduces a local variable "size" to store the calculated size, improving readability and shortening some lines.
4. The patch replaces the use of sizeof(type) with sizeof(object) in several places, ensuring the correct size is used.
5. The patch correctly checks for potential overflow before allocating memory for the header->snapc and header->snap_sizes variables.
6. The patch also fixes the allocation size for header->object_prefix and correctly copies the block_name value.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that could lead to potential issues and improves the code readability. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a warning message in the uvesafb driver. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the L2CAP channel in Bluetooth. The patch ensures that the appropriate L2CAP Disconnect request is sent when the remote device sends data without having any credits to do so. This bug could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug in the Bluetooth functionality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a bad `__init` annotation. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a dummy implementation of the `->load_lut()` callback function in the `mdp4_crtc_helper_funcs` and `mdp5_crtc_helper_funcs` structures. This function is optional and not used in the code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "platform_device_put". Since the function itself already handles the case when the argument is NULL, the check is redundant.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or optimization.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the declaration of the `selinux_complete_init` function. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "drm/nve0/fb/gddr5: switch off some other random bit at some point"
   - The description suggests that the patch is making a change related to the GDDR5 memory controller in the nve0 driver.

2. Code changes:
   - The patch modifies the `nve0_ram_calc_gddr5` function in the `ramnve0.c` file.
   - Specifically, it changes the argument passed to the `nve0_ram_train` function from `0xbc0e0000` to `0xbc0f0000`.

3. Contextual information:
   - The patch author mentions that the change was observed when comparing "us vs nv" on a GTX660.
   - No specific bug or issue is mentioned in the patch description.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or issue. The patch description does not provide enough context or details about the problem it aims to solve. Additionally, the change itself appears to be a random bit switch without clear justification.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further information or clarification is provided regarding the bug or issue it addresses.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the "data" variable in the mpc5xxx_can_probe function const. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change is a "trivial" fix as it only modifies the variable declaration to add the const qualifier.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the way a page is released in the f2fs_write_end function. The patch replaces the unlock_page and page_cache_release calls with f2fs_put_page.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "NFS: fix pnfs regression with directio writes". This suggests that it addresses a regression issue related to parallel NFS (pnfs) and direct I/O writes.

2. The commit message explains that a previous commit did not modify the calls in direct.c, which prevented direct I/O from using pnfs. This patch reintroduces that capability.

3. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the authors.

4. In the code changes, we can see modifications to the calls to `nfs_pageio_init_write()` in two places: lines 478 and 782.

5. In both cases, the calls to `nfs_pageio_init_write()` are replaced with calls to `NFS_PROTO(dreq->inode)->write_pageio_init()` and `NFS_PROTO(inode)->write_pageio_init()` respectively.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a regression issue related to pnfs and direct I/O writes. It modifies the code to correctly enable pnfs for direct I/O. Since this addresses a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros. These macros are described as "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscate the code." Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial code, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes section conflicts in mm/percpu.c, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue in the code.

2. The patch includes signed-off-by tags from Andi Kleen, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The patch modifies the declaration of the `pcpu_fc_names` array in include/linux/percpu.h and mm/percpu.c.

4. In include/linux/percpu.h, the patch changes the declaration of `pcpu_fc_names` from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, indicating that the array elements are constant pointers.

5. In mm/percpu.c, the patch changes the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array and changes the attribute from `__initdata` to `__initconst`, indicating that the array is initialized with constant data and is read-only after initialization.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a section conflict issue and introduces const qualifiers to the `pcpu_fc_names` array. While the patch does not explicitly address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does fix an issue that could potentially lead to problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'driver' argument from the 'pxa27x_udc_stop' function in the pxa27x_udc.c file. This change is made in preparation for future patches that will remove the 'driver' argument altogether.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the b43 N-PHY driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements reading support for radio 0x2057 and handles the different register values based on the device's PHY revision.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a functional enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the format specifier used for printing a DMA address in the ti-vpe driver. The warning suggests that the format specifier '%x' expects an unsigned int argument, but the argument provided is of type 'dma_addr_t'.

The patch modifies the format specifier from '%x' to '%pad' and uses the address of the 'start_addr' field in the 'dtd' structure. This change ensures that the correct format specifier is used for printing the DMA address.

Considering the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be categorized as a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character to the debug messages in the DRM driver for Intel integrated graphics. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only involves a spelling change.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an inconsistency in the interrupt numbers for RTC alarms between S2MPS11 and S2MPS14 devices. This inconsistency could potentially cause issues with the rtc-s5m driver when requesting specific interrupt numbers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses an inconsistency in interrupt numbers, which can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "NFC: Unlink LLCP child sockets from llcp_sock_release". From the title, it seems like the patch is addressing an issue related to NFC (Near Field Communication) and unlinking child sockets.

2. The patch is signed-off by Samuel Ortiz and John W. Linville, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the `llcp_sock_release` function in the `net/nfc/llcp/sock.c` file.

4. In the modified code, there is a check to see if `llcp_sock` is equal to `local->sockets[llcp_sock->ssap]`. If it is, the corresponding entry in `local->sockets` is set to NULL.

5. If the check fails, the patch uses a loop to iterate through the linked list of child sockets (`parent->list`) and checks if `llcp_sock` is equal to any of the child sockets. If a match is found, the child socket is unlinked from the list using `list_del(&s->list)`.

6. The patch then unlocks the `local->socket_lock` mutex.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to unlinking child sockets in the NFC LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol) code. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of handling child sockets in the `llcp_sock_release` function.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific bug related to NFC and does not contain any trivial fixes, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further review and testing by the appropriate maintainers and experts in the NFC subsystem would be necessary to make a final determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the argument name of the `host_int_add_ptk` function declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a new one. The deprecated function being replaced is `create_singlethread_workqueue()` with `alloc_ordered_workqueue()`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds a check to validate the number of reserved QPs (Queue Pairs) in the mlx4 driver.

2. Code Changes: The patch introduces the following changes:
   - Adds a new variable `reserved_from_bot` to store the number of reserved QPs from the bottom.
   - Checks if the sum of `reserved_from_bot` and `reserved_from_top` (number of reserved QPs from the top) exceeds the total number of QPs (`dev->caps.num_qps`).
   - If the number of reserved QPs is higher than the total number of QPs, it logs an error message and returns `-EINVAL`.
   - Initializes the bitmap for the QP table with the correct number of reserved QPs.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a potential issue related to the number of reserved QPs in the mlx4 driver.
   - It performs a check to ensure that the sum of reserved QPs from the top and bottom does not exceed the total number of QPs.
   - If the check fails, it logs an error message and returns an error code.
   - This patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a potential issue related to the number of reserved QPs in the mlx4 driver, which could lead to functional problems or data corruption.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing check for the return value of `sme_wait_for_reply` function in the `sme_ap_config` function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the reasons for the revert and the impact it may have on the system.

The commit being reverted is "drm/mediatek: set vblank_disable_allowed to true". Reverting this commit means that the line "drm->vblank_disable_allowed = true;" is removed from the code.

To make a decision, we need to understand the purpose of the original commit and the reason for the revert. Unfortunately, the given patch does not provide any information about the reasons for the revert or any associated bug reports or discussions.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine the impact of this revert. However, based on the information provided, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug, a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be a trivial change related to vblank handling.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further information is provided that demonstrates its criticality or significance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific clock configuration issue on the i.MX6 Solo/DualLite platform. The patch modifies the clock configuration for the "mlb" clock based on the CPU type.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the use of DPSIGN() to SPSIGN() in the ieee754sp_sub() function in the math-emu module for MIPS architecture. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the logging mechanism from printk(KERN_ERR) to dev_err(). This change improves the consistency and readability of the code, but it does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the direct usage of `put_device()` with the new API `power_supply_put()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or necessary changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for DCBX firmware commands in the mlx5 driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds two functions: `mlx5_query_port_dcbx_param` and `mlx5_set_port_dcbx_param`. These functions are used to query and set the DCBX_PARAM register for the mlx5_core_dev device.

2. The patch also adds two new enum values: `MLX5_REG_DCBX_PARAM` and `MLX5_REG_DCBX_APP`. These values are used as identifiers for the DCBX_PARAM and DCBX_APP registers.

3. Additionally, the patch adds an enum value `MLX5E_DCBX_PARAM_VER_OPER_AUTO` for the mlx5_dcbx_oper_mode enum. This enum value represents the auto negotiation mode for DCBX parameters.

4. The patch includes the necessary header files and function prototypes in `driver.h` and `port.h`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds functionality related to DCBX parameter handling in the mlx5 driver. However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "net/mlx5_core: Clear outbox of dealloc uar"
   The patch title suggests that the outbox should be cleared before executing the command.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by Majd Dibbiny, Eli Cohen, and David S. Miller.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch adds a line of code to clear the "out" structure using memset before executing the command.

   ```c
   memset(&out, 0, sizeof(out));
   ```

   This change ensures that the "out" structure is initialized to zero before being used.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential issue by clearing the "out" structure before executing the command. This can prevent any uninitialized data from being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

   However, based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this change fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a defensive programming change to ensure proper initialization.

   Additionally, the change itself is a trivial fix as it only adds a memset call to initialize the "out" structure.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a real and critical bug and contains a trivial fix (memset call).

Therefore, the answer is (B) This Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it enables Tx power based on the BT (Bluetooth) status in the iwlwifi driver's BT Coex (Bluetooth coexistence) module.

2. The patch modifies the code in the bt-coex.c file.

3. In the first code modification (lines 648-649), the patch replaces the check for bt_activity_grading being BT_OFF with a check for bt_status being false. This change implies that the reduced Tx power should be canceled if the BT is off.

4. In the second code modification (lines 868-869), the patch replaces the check for bt_activity_grading being BT_OFF with a check for bt_status being false. This change implies that if BT is off, the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) reports should be disabled.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a bug related to the incorrect usage of the bt_status field instead of bt_activity_grading. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this bug is critical or if it causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue).

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a build issue in the brcmfmac driver when the CONFIG_BRCMDBG configuration option is not set. The build issue is caused by the undeclared BRCMF_FWS_TYPE_SEQ_LEN define.

The patch introduces the missing define in the source file, which was originally added in a commit to fix an out-of-order transmission issue. However, the define was placed under an #ifdef DEBUG condition, which caused the build issue when CONFIG_BRCMDBG was not set.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real bug that causes a build error. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a missing define and resolves a build issue that prevents the driver from being built correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return type of the function `host_int_set_mac_chnl_num` from `s32` to `int`. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific component of the Linux kernel, namely netfilter's xt_hashlimit module.

2. The patch introduces a macro called XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL, which is used to validate if the set bits are within a valid range.

3. The patch modifies the existing code to use the XT_HASHLIMIT_ALL macro for validation instead of directly comparing against XT_HASHLIMIT_MAX.

4. The change ensures that only known and valid flag bits are accepted, preventing any potential issues caused by unknown or invalid flag bits.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

6. The change does not introduce any new functionality but improves the code's robustness and maintainability.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a potential issue related to flag bit validation in the xt_hashlimit module. It does not introduce any unnecessary changes and aligns with the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the vxlan module calling ip6_dst_lookup() in the TX path, which holds a write lock. This can potentially cause a deadlock if the write lock is not released before calling ndisc_send_rs().

2. The patch includes a Reviewed-by tag from Hannes Frederic Sowa and Signed-off-by tags from Cong Wang and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The code changes in the patch involve adding a new variable `dev` to store `idev->dev` and releasing the write lock before calling ndisc_send_rs(). Additionally, a new label `put` is introduced to handle the case where ipv6_get_lladdr() fails.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential deadlock issue and has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the function signature of `drbd_may_finish_epoch` from `struct drbd_conf *mdev` to `struct drbd_tconn *tconn`. This indicates that the function is being modified to use `tconn` instead of `mdev` as an argument.

2. The `drbd_may_finish_epoch` function is called in multiple places within the code, such as `receive_Barrier`, `e_end_block`, and `receive_Data`. These calls are updated to pass `tconn` instead of `mdev`.

3. The patch removes the line `wake_up(&mdev->ee_wait)` from the `drbd_may_finish_epoch` function. This line was responsible for waking up the `ee_wait` wait queue, but it is now removed.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is making changes to the function signature and removing a wake-up call. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch can be considered as trivial, as they do not fix any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces a new constant `PT_MAX_HUGEPAGE_LEVEL` in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h` and modifies several functions in `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c`. 

The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a code refactoring or optimization rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a processor identifier for the M5150 processor. This does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial fix as it only adds a new processor identifier.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the xgene GPIO driver. The patch modifies the driver to use the gpiochip data pointer instead of relying on container_of() to access the state container. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

Since the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the display of the "tx_priority_pauseframes" statistic in the ethtool stats for the be2net driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces calls to the function `cfs_trace_free_string_buffer()` with `kfree()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `uart_usp_ff_empty_mask` function in the `sirfsoc_uart.h` file.

2. The change is a correction to the calculation of the `empty_bit` variable.

3. Previously, the `empty_bit` was calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the `fifosize` variable.

4. The patch modifies the calculation by adding 1 to the result of the logarithm calculation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that corrects a calculation in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only removes undesired spaces, lines, and tabs. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential ordering issue in the ECAM kernel implementation when using ioremap() to map the ECAM configuration space memory region. The patch suggests updating the ioremap() interface to use pci_remap_cfgspace() instead, which guarantees that non-posted write transactions are issued for memory writes within the ECAM memory mapped address region.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause ordering issues in the PCIe fabric. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves message output by using pr_* instead of printk. This change is not trivial as it enhances the logging mechanism, making it more consistent and efficient.

2. The patch adds a hexdump of ECC code if the test fails. This provides additional information for debugging purposes and helps in identifying the cause of the failure.

3. The patch changes the log level for the hexdump of data from KERN_DEBUG to KERN_INFO. This change ensures that the relevant information is logged at an appropriate log level, making it easier to analyze the logs.

4. The patch factors out the hexdump code into a separate function. This improves code modularity and readability by separating the hexdump functionality into its own function.

Overall, the changes introduced by the patch are not trivial and contribute to improving the code's functionality, maintainability, and debuggability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization for the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel. It introduces a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism to improve the average lookup time for memslots.

While this patch does not fix a critical bug, it does address an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving performance. However, it does not seem to fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It is more of an optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that adds a return value to the function `kvmppc_core_check_requests` in multiple files. The return value is always set to 1, indicating that the function wants to get back into the guest.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for vendor commands and events in the mac80211_hwsim driver. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the platform data structure static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only reorganizes the structure layout to pack the `dst_cookie` field into the first cacheline hole for 64-bit hosts. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a bug introduced by commit a4b6a77b77ba4f526392612c2365797fab956014. The bug causes issues with MODVERSIONS loading of modules using memcmp on x86_32 architecture. The patch replaces VMLINUX_SYMBOL_STR with __VMLINUX_SYMBOL_STR to prevent unwanted expansion of the argument.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that can cause issues with module loading and potentially lead to build errors or data corruption. It does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Intel graphics driver (i915) in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds code to update the pipe size and adjust the fitter if needed.
2. It checks if the "i915_fastboot" parameter is set.
3. If the parameter is set and the current pipe has an LVDS or eDP output, it performs additional operations to turn off panel fitting.
4. The operations involve writing specific values to certain registers related to panel fitting.
5. After the panel fitting adjustments, the patch continues with the existing code to update the plane and unpin the framebuffer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to panel fitting on certain Intel graphics configurations during fast boot. It does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). It may be more appropriate for inclusion in the next regular kernel release or for testing in development branches.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing reset status information to the GFX hwmod in the OMAP2+ AM33xx platform. This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

The change only removes the "__initdata" attribute from the "keypad_pads" structure declaration. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a delivery system type at the fe struct. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a bug related to the iommu_map() function in the iommu.c file. The patch corrects the second argument of the trace_map() function to report the correct physical address (paddr).

It is a cosmetic change that improves code readability.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock in the GFS2 file system.

2. The patch modifies the functions gfs2_trans_add_meta and gfs2_trans_add_data in the fs/gfs2/trans.c file.

3. In both functions, a check is added to determine if the buffer_head is already in a transaction. If it is, the gfs2_log_lock is avoided, and the function jumps to the "out" label.

4. The "buffer_pinned" function is used to check if the buffer_head is already pinned. If it is, the TR_TOUCHED flag is set, and the function jumps to the "out" label.

5. After the gfs2_log_lock is acquired, the necessary operations are performed on the buffer_head.

6. Finally, the gfs2_log_unlock is called, and the buffer_head is unlocked.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock, which can improve performance but does not address a critical issue.

The patch is titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker support for Asus AiO ZN270IE" and is signed off by multiple contributors.

The patch addresses an issue where the Asus AiO ZN270IE with ALC256 has no audio output for the internal speaker and headphone. It requires GPIO 2 as an amp. The patch enables the GPIO and pulls it high.

Looking at the code changes, we can see that a new fixup entry is added for ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2. This fixup sets up GPIO2 for the speaker amp by sending specific AC_VERB commands.

Additionally, a new entry is added to the snd_pci_quirk table for the ASUS ZN270IE, associating it with the ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2 fixup.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific hardware issue related to audio output on the Asus AiO ZN270IE. It introduces a fixup to enable the required GPIO and associates it with the affected device in the snd_pci_quirk table.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a lack of audio output, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves code refactoring and consolidation.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing call to platform_set_drvdata in the da9052_bat_probe function. This fix ensures that platform_get_drvdata in da9052_bat_remove does not return NULL.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a log message if DP link training fails in the Nouveau display driver.

2. The patch modifies the while loop condition from `while (link_bw[0])` to `while ((ret = -EIO) && link_bw[0])`. This change assigns the value `-EIO` to `ret` and checks if `link_bw[0]` is non-zero. 

3. After the while loop, the patch checks if `ret` is less than 0 (indicating a failure) and logs an error message if so.

4. The patch then executes a post-train script from the vbios.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue by adding a log message when DP link training fails, which can help in diagnosing and troubleshooting display-related problems.

2. The patch author is Hangbin Liu, and it is also signed-off by David S. Miller, who is a well-known maintainer of the networking subsystem in the Linux kernel.

3. Looking at the code changes, we see that the patch modifies the `bond_fill_info` function in the `bond_netlink.c` file.

4. In the modified code, there is a call to `nla_put_be32` function, which is used to add a 32-bit attribute to a netlink message. The return value of this function is not being checked in the original code.

5. The patch adds an if statement to check the return value of `nla_put_be32`. If the return value is non-zero, indicating an error, the code jumps to a label named `nla_put_failure`.

6. The `nla_put_failure` label is not shown in the provided patch, but it suggests that there is error handling code present to handle the failure case.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue where the return value of `nla_put_be32` is not being checked. This could lead to a failure in adding the attribute to the netlink message, which may have consequences depending on how this message is used.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MC13783 RTC functionality on the MX31PDK board. Since this patch adds support for a real and critical feature (RTC), it can be considered for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) topology support in the Linux kernel. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

The patch primarily adds support for the topology file of ABI v4 and updates the ABI version macros. It also modifies the soc_valid_header() function to check for the supported ABI versions.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issues and only adds support for a specific ABI version, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a request for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) capabilities during target initialization in the ath6kl driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new variable "ret" of type int.
   - This change seems fine and does not introduce any issues.

2. The patch calls the function "ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd" with specific flags to request P2P capabilities.
   - This change is related to P2P functionality and does not seem to fix any critical bug or security issue. It appears to be an enhancement rather than a fix for an existing problem.

3. The patch includes error handling for the return value of "ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd".
   - This error handling is appropriate and ensures that if the P2P capabilities request fails, it will assume P2P is not supported.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug, a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not seem to be a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "drm/i915/gvt: Mark i915.enable_gvt as false if loading fails." It suggests updating the value of i915.enable_gvt to false if loading the GVT (Graphics Virtualization Technology) fails. This change allows userspace to easily detect when the loading of GVT fails as requested.

The patch includes a testcase (igt/gvt_basic) and is signed-off by Chris Wilson. It is also reviewed by Zhi Wang. The patch can be found at the provided link.

In the code changes, the existing return statements in the intel_gvt_init function are replaced with a "goto bail" statement. This change ensures that if the loading of GVT fails at any point, the code will jump to the "bail" label and set i915.enable_gvt to false before returning.

Overall, this patch addresses a critical issue by properly handling the failure to load GVT and provides a clear indication to userspace when the loading fails. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the registration of the wireless PHY (wiphy) in the ath6kl driver. The patch ensures that the wiphy is registered before calling the regulatory_hint() function, which is important for proper regulatory event processing.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue related to the order of function calls during initialization.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds support for the `vidioc_create_bufs` operation in the `bfin_capture` driver in the `media` subsystem. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding a new feature or functionality rather than fixing a bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not indicate any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   - The patch does not mention any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make the saa7134 driver more V4L2 compliant by filtering audio modes that came from the tuner and keeping only MONO/STEREO in radio mode.

2. Impact: The patch addresses a compliance issue in the saa7134 driver, specifically related to audio modes in radio mode. It does not mention any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the "radio_g_tuner" function in the "saa7134-video.c" file. It adds a line of code that filters the audio mode by applying a bitwise AND operation with the values of V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO and V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization order of the hardware (HW) so that the interrupt is only requested after the HW is initialized. This can help avoid potential issues that may arise from requesting the interrupt before the HW is fully initialized.

2. The patch replaces the use of `irq_of_parse_and_map` with `platform_get_irq`. This change is likely made to improve code consistency and maintainability.

3. The patch also includes a reset of the SPI-HW block before requesting the interrupt. This ensures that the HW is in a known state before enabling the interrupt.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code improvement that enhances the initialization order and replaces a function call.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch converts the usage of `wait_for(I915_READ(reg))` to `intel_wait_for_register()`, which is claimed to improve efficiency and reduce code bloat.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it is not fixing any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be exporting the `tegra_chip_id` variable in the ARM Tegra platform code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial change that exports a variable.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it sets clock rates before timer initialization on the ARM-based shmobile armadillo800eva board.

2. The patch fixes an issue where the timer was using the default extal1 clock rate (25MHz) instead of the correct rate for this board (24MHz).

3. The patch is signed-off by Hideki EIRAKU and Acked-by Kuninori Morimoto.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Simon Horman, who is the maintainer of the arch/arm/mach-shmobile/board-armadillo800eva.c file.

5. In the code changes, the eva_clock_init() function is moved from its original position to be called after r8a7740_clock_init() and shmobile_earlytimer_init() functions in the eva_earlytimer_init() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect clock rate usage by the timer on the armadillo800eva board. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a recommended alternative. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo and improves the creation of debugfs entries in the DRM/STI driver. The patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function and resolves a sparse warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving a structure definition from one header file to another. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that encapsulates the boot vector code into a function for cpuidle. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it mainly involves code refactoring and does not address any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The patch mainly adds a new member to the `struct intel_gmbus` and updates the usage of this member in a few places.

Since the patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, and it only contains trivial changes, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `cx24123_pll_writereg()`. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing an unused argument), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a timeout for ramrod replies in the cnic driver for the bnx2x device.
2. The timeout is implemented using the wait_event_timeout() function, which allows the driver to make forward progress and reset the chip if it has encountered parity errors.
3. The patch modifies the cnic_bnx2x_destroy_ramrod() function to use wait_event_timeout() instead of wait_event().
4. The patch also modifies the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function to use wait_event_timeout() instead of wait_event().
5. In the cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy() function, the patch sets the completion status of kcqe to FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR if the wait condition is not met within the timeout.
6. The patch adds a macro CNIC_RAMROD_TMO with a value of (HZ / 4), which represents a timeout value.
7. The patch adds a new completion status FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR in cnic_defs.h.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds a timeout mechanism for handling ramrod replies in the cnic driver. It addresses a potential issue related to parity errors and allows the driver to reset the chip if necessary. The patch also introduces a new completion status for error handling.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to the bnx2x device and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The failure of devm_clk_get for the core clock was being ignored, and the core_clk was explicitly set to NULL. This could lead to potential issues or unexpected behavior.

2. The patch fixes the issue by returning the failure when devm_clk_get fails for the core clock. This ensures that any potential errors are properly handled.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific issue at hand.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Sarangdhar Joshi, Stephen Boyd, and Bjorn Andersson. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and is considered suitable for inclusion.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "drm/dp/mst: reply with ACK for UP reqs" and it aims to fix the way UP (Update Port) requests are handled in the DisplayPort (DP) Multi-Stream Transport (MST) subsystem of the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver.

The patch changes the reply type from NACK (negative acknowledgment) to ACK (acknowledgment) for UP requests. Currently, the code replies with NACK, which may confuse receivers. Although no actual issues have been observed, it is still important to respond to UP requests correctly.

The change is made in the function `drm_dp_encode_up_ack_reply` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/drm_dp_mst_topology.c`. The line `reply.reply_type = 1;` is modified to `reply.reply_type = 0;`, setting the reply type to ACK.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not appear to be a trivial fix (e.g., spelling changes, whitespace cleanups) and addresses a potential issue that could cause confusion for receivers of UP requests. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and does not take into account any potential conflicts or dependencies with other patches or code in the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to memory allocation failure in the hpsa_get_device_id function in the hpsa.c file. The patch changes the return value from -1 to -ENOMEM when kzalloc fails to allocate memory.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does fix a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues if memory allocation fails. Additionally, it does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" on the s390 architecture. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds additional information to the /proc/cpuinfo file.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a clock for the FSI sound driver on the sh73a0 ARM platform. This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to setting the EQ (interrupt) delay multiplier in the lpfc driver for Emulex Fibre Channel adapters. 

The patch modifies the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup function in lpfc_init.c to configure the EQ delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function. It iterates over the EQs created and sets the delay multiplier using LPFC_MAX_EQ_DELAY at a time.

Additionally, the patch modifies the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay function in lpfc_sli.c to accept a uint32_t parameter instead of a uint16_t parameter.

Considering the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific bug related to interrupt coalescing and the EQ delay multiplier in the lpfc driver. However, without further context or information about the severity and impact of the bug, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to evaluate the severity of the bug, the impact it has on system stability, performance, or security, and whether the patch introduces any regressions or side effects.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and purpose.

The patch adds a new helper function called `tcp_tsopt_ecr_before` to the `tcp_input.c` file. This helper function is used to prepare the main RACK patch.

The `tcp_tsopt_ecr_before` function checks if the received timestamp echo reply (TSecr) is before a given timestamp. It returns true if the TSecr is valid and before the given timestamp, and false otherwise.

The patch also modifies the `tcp_packet_delayed` function to use the new `tcp_tsopt_ecr_before` helper function instead of directly comparing the TSecr with the retransmission timestamp.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a specific issue. Without further context, it is not possible to make an informed decision.

Therefore, I cannot determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be adding hardware capabilities and structures for SR-IOV E-Switch in the mlx5 driver. However, without further information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue being fixed and its impact on the system. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch, and any other relevant details, so that I can make a more accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the data type of the variable "times" from "unsigned int" to "int" in three different functions: qat_hal_check_ae_alive, qat_hal_init_esram, and qat_hal_clear_gpr. This change seems reasonable as the variable is used in a loop and should be decremented until it reaches -1. Changing the data type to "int" allows for proper comparison with the condition "times < 0". This change does not seem to introduce any issues.

2. In the function qat_hal_check_ae_alive, the condition for checking if "times" has reached 0 is changed to "times < 0". This change is correct as the variable "times" is decremented in the loop until it reaches -1. If "times" becomes negative, it means the loop has executed the maximum number of times without finding the expected condition, indicating a timeout issue. This change seems appropriate.

3. In the function qat_hal_init_esram, the condition for checking if "times" has reached 0 is changed to "times < 0". Similar to the previous change, this change is correct as the variable "times" is decremented in the loop until it reaches -1. If "times" becomes negative, it means the loop has executed the maximum number of times without the expected condition being met, indicating a failure to initialize eSram. This change seems appropriate.

4. In the function qat_hal_clear_gpr, the condition for checking if "times" has reached 0 is changed to "times < 0". Again, this change is correct as the variable "times" is decremented in the loop until it reaches -1. If "times" becomes negative, it means the loop has executed the maximum number of times without the expected condition being met, indicating a failure to clear GPR. This change seems appropriate.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix timeout issues in the qat_hal_check_ae_alive, qat_hal_init_esram, and qat_hal_clear_gpr functions. These issues can potentially cause hangs or failures in the respective functionalities. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a spelling mistake in the code comments. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that added a "drv_priv" pointer for driver use in the mac80211 subsystem. The reason for the revert is that no driver has been found to need this functionality, and the desired functionality has been implemented in a different way.

Since this patch is a revert and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any real and critical bug, it can be considered a "trivial" change. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the "const" keyword from two declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

3. Analysis:
   - The patch adds a new feature to the bcm2835-dma driver, specifically support for dma_memcopy.
   - It includes a check for an error condition in bcm2835_dma_create_cb_chain, which improves error handling.
   - The patch has been tested using dmatest for all enabled channels, indicating some level of verification.
   - It adds a new function bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy for preparing a DMA memcpy operation.
   - The dma_cap_set is updated to include DMA_MEMCPY capability, indicating that the driver now supports DMA memcpy.
   - The od->ddev.device_prep_dma_memcpy function pointer is updated to point to bcm2835_dma_prep_dma_memcpy.
   - BIT(DMA_MEM_TO_MEM) is added to od->ddev.directions, indicating support for DMA memcpy.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch adds a new feature to the bcm2835-dma driver, specifically support for dma_memcopy. It includes error handling improvements and has been tested. Additionally, it updates the necessary function pointers and capabilities to support DMA memcpy. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to a potentially uninitialized variable in the bcm2835_clock_choose_div_and_prate() function of the bcm2835 clock driver. 

Since this patch addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new event buffer cache in the DWC3 USB driver. The purpose of this cache is to copy triggered events from the event buffer and process them later in a bottom half handler. The patch also includes memory allocation for the cache.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention fixing a bug. It seems to be adding a workaround for a known erratum in recent DWC3 releases. Without further information about the erratum and its impact, it is difficult to determine if it qualifies as a critical bug fix.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   - The patch does not introduce any code changes that could potentially cause build errors, oopses, hangs, or data corruption.

3. Does the patch address a real security issue?
   - The patch does not mention anything about addressing a security issue.

4. Does the patch fix an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not provide any information about an issue that falls into this category.

5. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any security issues or "oh, that's not good" issues. However, it is important to note that without more context about the known erratum and its impact, it is difficult to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time. This can be considered as an enhancement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. This indicates that the patch addresses a power-saving issue, which can be considered important.

2. The patch mentions that AFTR mode support has already been implemented for other Exynos SoCs for a few years, and this patch adds support specifically for the Exynos3250 SoC. This suggests that the patch is adding functionality that has already been proven and tested on other SoCs.

3. The differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC compared to Exynos4x12 SoCs are listed, including the use of different secure firmware calls, different wakeup masks, and the need to set/clear the C2_STATE BOOT mode flag pre/post AFTR. These differences indicate that the patch is addressing specific hardware variations and ensuring proper functionality on the Exynos3250 SoC.

4. The patch includes changes in the "firmware.c" and "pm.c" files, which are relevant for implementing AFTR mode support.

5. The patch includes modifications to the wakeup mask settings in the "pm.c" file, specifically adding support for S5P_WAKEUP_MASK2 for the Exynos3250 SoC. This indicates that the patch is addressing specific hardware requirements for proper wakeup behavior.

6. The patch includes modifications to the "aftr_finisher" function in the "pm.c" file, setting the wakeup mask based on the SoC type. This ensures that the correct wakeup mask is used for the Exynos3250 SoC.

7. The patch includes modifications to the "enter_aftr" function in the "pm.c" file, setting and clearing the C2_STATE BOOT mode flag based on the SoC type. This ensures proper behavior during the AFTR mode transition for the Exynos3250 SoC.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the patch addresses a specific hardware variation (Exynos3250 SoC) and adds support for AFTR mode, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. The patch includes changes in relevant files and handles hardware-specific requirements properly.

Therefore, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error in the `arch/mips/ath79/mach-ap136.c` file. The error is caused by passing too many arguments to the `ap136_pci_init` function. The patch adds the missing argument `u8 *eeprom` to the function declaration.

Since this patch fixes a build error, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the fix is trivial as it only adds a missing argument. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to `pwm_apply_args()` after requesting the PWM device. The comment in the code suggests that this is an intermediate state and that `pwm_apply_args()` should be removed once the atomic PWM infrastructure is in place and the driver makes use of it.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a trivial fix that can be considered a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup," it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the FSI DMAEngine in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the DMA is properly terminated at the start/stop time, which prevents noise on playback. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause audio playback issues. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to NFSv4.0 reclaiming reboot state when re-establishing clientid. It includes changes to the `nfs4_handle_reclaim_lease_error` function, specifically for handling errors related to stale clientid.

The changes made in the patch include:
1. Clearing the `NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM` bit in the `cl_state` variable.
2. Adding a call to `nfs4_state_clear_reclaim_reboot` to clear the reclaim reboot state.
3. Adding a call to `nfs4_state_start_reclaim_reboot` to start the reclaim reboot process.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to stale clientid in NFSv4.0. It also includes changes that could potentially fix hangs or data corruption caused by stale clientid.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function in the `ie6xx_wdt.c` file. The `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is currently annotated as `__devexit`, but it is called from `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` as part of its error cleanup path.

Looking at the patch, it seems that the intention is to remove the `__devexit` annotation from the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function. This change is reflected in the patch by modifying the function declaration from `static void __devexit ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit(void)` to `static void ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit(void)`.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix related to section mismatches.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds missing `of_node_put` calls to decrement the reference count, which is a cleanup change rather than fixing a critical issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that marks the `rapl_ids` array as `__initconst`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that involves spelling changes and whitespace cleanups. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the "pending" flag in the command structure. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `set_page_private` and `page_private` with `set_freepage_migratetype` and `get_freepage_migratetype` respectively. This change aims to make the code clearer.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it falls under the category of a trivial fix (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unused "debug" module parameter from the cypress_m8.c USB serial driver. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unused code), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability by using defined macros instead of hard-coding values. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing "break" statements in the ath5k_hw_set_spur_mitigation_filter function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code style cleanup in the rt2800lib.c file of the rt2x00 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Since this patch is a trivial code style cleanup and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a pointless copy operation in the nfsd4_exchange_id function in the nfs4state.c file. The removed code is commented out and does not seem to have any functional impact on the code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused variables and corresponding lines. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function and replaces per_cpu_ptr() with this_cpu_ptr(). This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the logging mechanism for link up/down messages in the ixgbevf driver. The change replaces the use of `hw_dbg` with `dev_info` to log the messages.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch mainly converts the mx51_clocks_init() function to a device tree (DT) call and removes the mx51_clocks_init_dt() function.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves code refactoring, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devinitdata. This change is necessary because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option, and __devinitdata is no longer needed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug. The patch simply replaces the call to `platform_get_drvdata(pdev)` with the already available `dw` variable. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding clock definitions for the SYS-DMAC modules in the r8a7796 SoC. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch introduces two new functions, `vm_entry_controls_reset_shadow` and `vm_exit_controls_reset_shadow`, which simply read the entry/exit control fields of the VMCS and store them in the respective shadow variables.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "trivial" fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that cleans up the declaration of the `ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work` function in `ieee80211_i.h`. The patch removes the duplicate declaration of the function and moves it to the correct location.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable from "pvRecvBuffer" to "recv_buf" in the wilc_mq_recv function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a simple renaming of a variable for better code readability.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for host-protection-interruption in the s390 architecture for KVM. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is introduced with ESOP, which means it is available for the guest if it is allowed to use ESOP. This suggests that it is a feature enhancement rather than a bug fix.

2. The patch has been Acked-by Christian Borntraeger and Signed-off-by David Hildenbrand and Christian Borntraeger. These are indications that the patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant experts.

3. The code changes in the patch are focused on modifying the scb_s structure. It sets the eca field by performing a bitwise OR operation with the eca field of scb_o and a constant value. This part of the code does not seem to address any critical bug or issue.

4. The patch also sets the ecb field of scb_s by performing a bitwise OR operation with the ecb field of scb_o and a constant value, but only if the KVM_S390_VM_CPU_FEAT_ESOP feature is enabled. This suggests that the patch is adding support for host-protection-interruption when the ESOP feature is enabled.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is adding a feature enhancement rather than fixing a critical bug or issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch modifies the key initialization of tcp_fastopen cookies to use the function `net_get_random_once` instead of `get_random_bytes`. This change ensures that if a user sets a custom key, it won't be overwritten when the first cookie is generated later on.

The patch also adds a new function `tcp_fastopen_init_key_once` that generates a dummy secret key but doesn't publish it. This is done to prevent the regeneration of a new key on the first invocation of `tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen`.

Overall, this patch seems to address a potential issue with key generation in tcp_fastopen cookies. It doesn't fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it appears to be more of an improvement or optimization.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch primarily replaces the usage of `serial->private` with `usb_get_serial_data(serial)` and `usb_set_serial_data(serial, data)`.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode for the OMAP DMA engine. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch description states that the audio stack used omap_stop_dma/omap_start_dma to pause/resume the DMA, which has been used for years on OMAP based products. This suggests that the patch addresses an existing functionality used in production systems.

2. The patch modifies the omap_chan structure by adding a new boolean field called "paused." This field will be used to track whether the DMA channel is currently paused or not.

3. In the omap_dma_terminate_all function, the patch adds a check to avoid stopping the DMA twice if it has already been paused. This ensures that the DMA is only stopped once when terminating all ongoing transfers.

4. In the omap_dma_pause function, the patch checks if the DMA channel is configured in cyclic mode before allowing pause/resume operations. If the channel is not in cyclic mode, it returns an error. If the channel is in cyclic mode and not already paused, it stops the DMA and sets the "paused" flag to true.

5. In the omap_dma_resume function, similar to omap_dma_pause, it checks if the DMA channel is in cyclic mode before allowing pause/resume operations. If the channel is not in cyclic mode, it returns an error. If the channel is in cyclic mode and already paused, it starts the DMA and sets the "paused" flag to false.

6. The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds a new feature to the OMAP DMA engine, specifically supporting pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode. This feature has been used in production systems for years, indicating its importance and relevance. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and follows the existing code structure and conventions.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential buffer overflow issue by replacing the use of strncpy with strncmp for string comparison. This change ensures that the final null terminator is not omitted, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

2. The patch also improves the code by using the sizeof operator instead of a hardcoded constant (MEI_CL_NAME_SIZE) when copying the device name. This ensures that the correct size is used and reduces the risk of buffer overflows.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Samuel Ortiz <sameo@linux.intel.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

4. The patch has been signed-off by the original author (Tomas Winkler <tomas.winkler@intel.com>) and the maintainer (Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>).

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue and improves the code without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - disable RRC by default." It suggests disabling the RRC (Radio Resource Control) feature by default in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices.

2. The patch checks if the firmware advertises support for the BT Coex RRC feature. If the firmware supports it, the feature is enabled; otherwise, it remains disabled.

3. The patch modifies the "enum iwl_ucode_tlv_capa" enumeration in the iwl-fw-file.h file to include a new capability flag, "IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_BT_COEX_RRC," indicating support for BT Coex RRC.

4. The patch updates the iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported() function in the mvm.h file to check if the BT Coex RRC feature is supported by the firmware and enabled in the driver configuration.

5. The patch modifies the iwl_send_bt_init_conf_old() function in the coex_legacy.c file to set the BT_COEX_RRC flag in the bt_cmd->flags field if the BT Coex RRC feature is supported and enabled.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new feature to disable the BT Coex RRC by default in the iwlwifi driver. It checks if the firmware supports the feature and enables it accordingly. This change does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the blk-mq subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch correctly frees the hctx->ctx_map inside the blk_mq_free_queue() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding JPEG register definitions for the CODA7541 media platform driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be adding register definitions, which are not critical bug fixes.

2. The patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a straightforward addition of register definitions.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the lnet_ping() function in the staging/lustre/lnet module. The patch changes the type of the "ids" parameter from "lnet_process_id_t *" to "lnet_process_id_t __user *", which properly marks the userspace pointer.

The patch also mentions that it silences sparse warnings about different address spaces, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue related to memory access.

Since the patch fixes a potential issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver for Qualcomm Atheros wireless devices. The patch adds two new event handlers, `wmi_evt_linkup` and `wmi_evt_linkdown`, which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively.

The `wmi_evt_linkup` function is called when a linkup event is received from the firmware. It turns on the carrier for the network device associated with the wil6210 driver, indicating that the data path is ready.

The `wmi_evt_linkdown` function is called when a linkdown event is received from the firmware. It turns off the carrier for the network device, indicating that the link is down.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding functionality to handle linkup/linkdown events in the driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to unlocking on an error path in the `ieee80211_ibss_join()` function in the `ibss.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch adds an unlock operation before returning `-EINVAL` in case of a failure in `ieee80211_set_channel_type()`.

Since this patch addresses a potential error path and ensures proper unlocking, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in a stable release. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to constify the `def_qos_parameters` structure in the `rtl8192u` staging driver. This change ensures that the structure is treated as read-only and cannot be modified accidentally.

2. The patch uses the Coccinelle script to identify the usage of `memcpy` with the `def_qos_parameters` structure. By declaring the structure as const, it prevents any unintended modifications.

3. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the author and the maintainer.

4. The change is specific to the `rtl8192u` staging driver, which suggests that it addresses a bug or issue specific to that driver.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential bug by constifying the `def_qos_parameters` structure and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a local variable from "nr_irqs" to "nr_irq" in two different files. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing forward declarations of structures in cpuidle.h. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the pinctrl-mtk-common.c file. The patch ensures that the "configs" variable is properly freed before returning from the function in case of an error. This prevents a potential memory leak.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the gpio-ml-ioh driver. The patch modifies the ioh_gpio_get() function to ensure that the return value is clamped to [0,1] by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding entries in the HID table and referencing the "bytcht_da7213" driver. This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the socket argument in the function `tcp_create_openreq_child()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the code in drivers/acpi/osl.c.
2. It changes the allocation function from kmalloc to kzalloc, which allocates and initializes memory to zero.
3. The patch adds comments to explain the purpose of the code and its relation to lockdep complaints.
4. It rearranges the code to make fewer checks and improve readability.
5. It initializes a work structure using INIT_WORK for each workqueue separately to prevent unnecessary lockdep complaints.
6. The patch also adds a comment about preventing corruption caused by software-initiated SMI on some machines.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code improvement and documentation update rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change only moves the initialization of the 'status' variable within the function. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a platform device registration for the HDMI audio codec on OMAP4-based Pandaboard and PandaboardES boards. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. 

However, the provided patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding support for a feature (transmitting audio through HDMI) rather than fixing a critical bug. 

Therefore, based on the given information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the configuration of SDIO after power is reapplied to the device. This issue could potentially lead to functional problems or data corruption. Therefore, it seems to address a real and critical bug.

However, it is important to note that the patch does not contain any additional information about the bug or its impact. Without further details, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Additionally, the patch does not include any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes, which aligns with the requirement of not including such changes in stable releases.

Considering the information provided, I would lean towards accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it would be beneficial to have more context and information about the bug and its impact to make a more informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a condition that is reported as impossible. The patch removes a test for an impossible condition where `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. However, the condition `path > 0` is still present.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It only removes a test for an impossible condition, which is not a real bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs. The patch adds compatibility checks for several R-Car Gen2 SoCs, including r8a7792, r8a7793, and r8a7794. 

Since the patch enables PM runtime for these specific SoCs, it suggests that there might have been issues related to power management on these platforms. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issues being addressed.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system. If the bug is critical and meets the criteria of causing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other significant issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if the bug is not critical or the patch contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please provide additional information or context about the bug being fixed to make a more accurate determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value from 0 to NULL in the host1x_bo_lookup() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any specific issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to replace the usage of `hid_output_raw_report` with `hid_hw_output_report` in the HID wiimote driver.

2. The rationale behind this change is that the new API, `hid_hw_output_report`, is equivalent to the old one, `hid_output_raw_report`, for the BT transport layer.

3. The patch is signed-off by Benjamin Tissoires and reviewed by David Herrmann, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

4. Looking at the code changes, the patch checks if the `ll_driver->output_report` function pointer is available before proceeding. If it is not available, the function returns -ENODEV.

5. The patch then duplicates the buffer using `kmemdup` and passes it to the `hid_hw_output_report` function.

6. Finally, the duplicated buffer is freed, and the return value of `hid_hw_output_report` is returned.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a non-trivial fix that replaces an existing API with an equivalent one. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or a whitespace cleanup.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, which require fixing real and critical bugs, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and modifies the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function to accept the frequency as an argument. It also sets the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer.

Since this patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the omapdrm driver in the Linux kernel. It changes the logging level of certain error messages related to unsupported pixel formats, differing pitches between planes, and buffer object size validation. Instead of printing these messages as error messages, they are changed to debug messages.

The reason for this change is to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages by validating userspace parameters. By turning these error messages into debug messages, the patch aims to reduce unnecessary noise in the kernel log.

This change does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving the logging behavior and preventing potential log flooding.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, and it addresses a non-trivial issue, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing an unnecessary check before calling the `vfree()` function in the `asihpi_adapter_remove()` function of the `hpioctl.c` file in the ALSA asihpi driver. The patch claims that the `vfree()` function already performs input parameter validation, making the check redundant.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a code quality improvement by removing an unnecessary check.

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` to the file `smilsub.c` and removing the unnecessary declaration in `smilmain.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. The patch sets the appropriate exit reason and suberror codes when instruction emulation fails, ensuring that the failure is properly reported to userspace.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to error reporting, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the IPv6 subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` to pass the `msg` parameter as a `struct msghdr` instead of using `msg->iov_iter.iov`. This change allows for better handling of the message data.

Since the patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the failure logging into the `isl29028_set_als_scale()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a spelling mistake in two files: zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a separate function for resetting shadow counters in the perf stat tool. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only corrects the initialization of the ".n_bitrates" field in the mwifiex_band_2ghz structure to use the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead of hardcoding the value.

Since this patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility on the s390 architecture. This facility is being detected by checking the value of the "fac117" field in the "read_info_sccb" structure.

Since this patch is adding support for a new hardware facility, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` to check the device readiness. This function returns true if the device is ready and false otherwise. This seems to be a valid addition as it provides a necessary functionality.

2. The patch also sets the `dev_ready` function pointer of the `nand_chip` structure to `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready`. This ensures that the `dev_ready` function will be called when needed. This is a necessary change to properly handle device readiness.

3. Additionally, the patch sets the `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure to 50. This value represents the delay in microseconds between chip operations. This change seems reasonable and may be required for proper device operation.

4. The patch also updates the `bbt_options` field of the `nand_chip` structure to `NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH`. This indicates that the NAND bad block table should be stored in the flash memory. This change seems valid and necessary for proper functionality.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces necessary changes to fix or improve the functionality of the `bcm47xxnflash` driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses real issues related to device readiness and chip delay. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only adds a comment and sets the `scanmask` value to `0xffff`. Since this patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the firmware image filename for the xc4000 tuner. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: tty: serial: Fix termios/port flags mismatch
   - The patch aims to fix a termios/port flags mismatch issue in the serial driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - Uart port drivers may reconfigure termios settings based on available hardware support.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Peter Hurley <peter@hurleysoftware.com> and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>.

4. Code Changes:
   - The patch modifies the uart_change_speed function in serial_core.c.
   - It adds a call to uport->ops->set_termios before setting/clearing the ASYNC_CTS_FLOW and ASYNC_CHECK_CD flags.
   - It also adds a line to reload the cflag from termios after calling uart_change_speed.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue related to termios/port flags mismatch in the serial driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic and adding necessary function calls.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or incorrect behavior in the serial driver.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch moves the `qos_request` field from `saa7134_fh` structure to `saa7134_dev` structure. The `qos_request` field is a global field, not a per-filehandle field.

2. Changes in saa7134-video.c:
   - Line 2205: The `pm_qos_add_request` function is modified to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.
   - Line 2220: The `pm_qos_remove_request` function is modified to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.

3. Changes in saa7134.h:
   - Line 472: The `qos_request` field is removed from the `saa7134_fh` structure.
   - Line 595: The `qos_request` field is added to the `saa7134_dev` structure.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is moving the `qos_request` field from a per-filehandle field to a global field. This change does not appear to fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the changes seem to be more of a code refactoring rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be fixing a specific issue related to handling ECC errors during the scanning of bad block markers in the MTD NAND driver. The patch modifies the behavior to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the initialization call for the bus watcher from the deprecated `__initcall` to `device_initcall`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls outside the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch enables setting the minimum inline header mode for Virtual Functions (VFs) in the mlx5 driver.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to modify the minimum inline header mode for a specific VF. It takes the mlx5_core_dev structure, VF port number, and the desired minimum inline value as parameters. The function constructs the necessary input data structure and calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` to modify the VF's minimum inline header mode.

3. Impact Analysis:
   This patch introduces a new functionality to the mlx5 driver, allowing the minimum inline header mode to be set for VFs. It does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug fix.

4. Triviality Check:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issues. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: "Btrfs: fix freeze vs auto defrag"
   This indicates that the patch aims to fix a specific issue related to freezing the file system and auto defragmentation.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - Miao Xie <miaox@cn.fujitsu.com>
   - Chris Mason <chris.mason@fusionio.com>

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the function __btrfs_run_defrag_inode() in the file fs/btrfs/file.c.

   - Line 318: Adds a call to sb_start_write() before calling btrfs_defrag_file(). This function is used to acquire a write lock on the superblock, which prevents concurrent modifications to the file system.
   - Line 322: Adds a call to sb_end_write() after btrfs_defrag_file(). This function releases the write lock on the superblock.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing the file system and auto defragmentation. It ensures that when the file system is frozen, the auto defragmentation process does not run. The added calls to sb_start_write() and sb_end_write() acquire and release the write lock on the superblock, respectively.

   This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by preventing the auto defragmentation process from running when the file system is frozen.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or a real security issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively trivial, as they involve acquiring and releasing a write lock on the superblock.

Therefore, the answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies ternary operators using a GNU extension.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event` in the ASoC twl6040 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: "ASoC: max98090: read micbias from device property"
   - This patch aims to read the max98090 micbias from ACPI or device tree (DT).

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Fang, Yang A <yang.a.fang@intel.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>,Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/max98090.txt.

3. Changes in the patch:
   - The patch adds a new optional property "maxim,micbias" to specify the micbias voltage for the analog mic.
   - The valid voltage values for micbias are provided as 0 - 2.2v, 1 - 2.55v, 2 - 2.4v, and 3 - 2.8v.
   - The patch reads the "maxim,micbias" property value and sets the micbias voltage accordingly.
   - If the property is not found or the value is out of range, it falls back to the default value of 2.8v.
   - The patch also includes some debug and informational messages.

4. Analysis:
   - This patch introduces a new optional property to specify the micbias voltage, which can be useful for configuring the analog mic.
   - It reads the property value and sets the micbias voltage accordingly, falling back to a default value if necessary.
   - The patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.
   - It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
   - The changes made by this patch seem to be specific to the max98090 codec and do not have a broader impact on the Linux kernel.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit in the patch_hdmi.c file of the sound/pci/hda directory. The regression caused incorrect assignment of the pin NID. The fix assigns the correct pin NID to the cvts[0] structure member.

Since this patch addresses a regression, it can be considered a real bug fix. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the regression or its impact on the system. Additionally, the patch does not mention any specific build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Given the information provided, it seems that this patch may not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. It does not appear to fix a critical bug or address a significant issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture. The warning indicates a mismatch between the initialization section and the CPU initialization section. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the log level from `pr_info` to `pr_debug` for a success message. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to define the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial change that adds definitions for the contiguous bit.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the "resiliency_test" function to the "init.text" section and marks it as "__init". This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for a specific hardware feature, the SFP insertion interrupt, on X550EM devices with SFPs. This indicates that it addresses a real and critical issue related to hardware functionality.

2. The patch is signed-off by Mark Rustad and tested by Phil Schmitt, both from Intel. This suggests that the patch has undergone review and testing by individuals familiar with the codebase and the hardware in question.

3. The changes made in the patch are confined to the `ixgbe_main.c` file within the `drivers/net/ethernet/intel/ixgbe` directory. This indicates that the patch is focused on a specific driver and does not introduce changes to other parts of the kernel.

4. The added code checks if the device ID matches `IXGBE_DEV_ID_X550EM_X_SFP` and enables the SFP insertion interrupt accordingly. This demonstrates that the patch addresses a specific condition related to the X550EM device with SFPs.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical issue related to hardware functionality, has been reviewed and tested, and introduces changes only to the relevant driver. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant NULL check and a check for DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "iwlwifi: nvm: init correct nvm channel list for 8000 devices" and is signed-off by Arik Nemtsov and Emmanuel Grumbach. It modifies the function `iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info` in the file `iwl-nvm-parse.c` and its declaration in the header file `iwl-nvm-parse.h`. Additionally, it modifies the usage of `iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info` in the file `mac80211.c`.

The patch addresses an issue where the regulatory data mistakenly contains only 7000 series channels for 8000 series devices. It introduces a conditional statement that initializes the correct nvm channel list based on the device family. This ensures that the regulatory data includes the appropriate channels for 8000 series devices.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect regulatory data and impact the functionality of 8000 series devices. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix that improves the code by using the core function `irq_set_affinity()` instead of a custom implementation. Additionally, it switches to using `for_each_active_irq()` instead of iterating over all IRQ descriptors.

Since this patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue related to hotplug IRQ migration, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the `imp_known_replied_xid` when trying to resend an already replied replay request. This is done because the xid of this replay request could be less than the current `imp_known_replied_xid`.

2. The patch is signed-off by Niu Yawei <yawei.niu@intel.com> and Oleg Drokin <green@linuxhacker.ru>. It is also reviewed by Alex Zhuravlev <alexey.zhuravlev@intel.com> and Fan Yong <fan.yong@intel.com>. The patch is associated with the Intel bug ID LU-8645.

3. The code changes are made in the `drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/ptlrpc/recover.c` file.

4. The patch adds a check to see if `req` is not NULL and `imp->imp_resend_replay` is true, and if `req->rq_unreplied_list` is empty. If these conditions are met, `ptlrpc_add_unreplied(req)` is called, and `imp->imp_known_replied_xid` is updated with `ptlrpc_known_replied_xid(imp)`.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to replaying requests in the Lustre staging driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a necessary update to `imp_known_replied_xid` based on the conditions mentioned.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds module alias autogeneration for AMBA drivers in the nomadik-rng.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes a trivial typo in a comment, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the patch contains a "trivial" fix, which is a spelling change. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch removes the assignment of the local variable `mq_rq` to `mq->mqrq_cur`, which is not used after the jump. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization for ARMv6 and later processors. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not including it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `of_node_put` function call after calling `of_parse_phandle`. This fix ensures that the device node obtained from `of_parse_phandle` is properly released when it is no longer needed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "__init" annotation from the "gpmc_hwecc_bch_capable" and "gpmc_nand_init" functions in the "gpmc-nand.c" file. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch mainly involve converting the set_frontend and get_frontend functions to use DVBv5 parameters instead of the dvb_frontend_parameters struct.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains only trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a mfd cell for the power button part of the axp288 PMICs. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

From the information provided, it seems that this patch is adding necessary resources for the axp288 power button device. It does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. Without further context or information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a critical bug or addresses a significant issue.

However, based on the information provided, it does not seem to contain any trivial fixes. It adds the necessary resources for the power button device, which can be considered a non-trivial change.

Given the limited information, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to be a non-trivial change related to the power button device. However, further evaluation and context from the Linux kernel maintainers would be necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames PVOID to "void *" in Misc.c, it appears to be a trivial fix involving a simple renaming of a variable type. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch is simply replacing the existing driver registration and unregistration calls with the new platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only introduces a minor code change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. It only moves the "err_request_irq" label up to reflect the order of operations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to indicate that a set contains expressions for evaluation. It also includes a check to reject sets that specify both mapping and evaluation operations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific adaptation for the OMAP3-based igep0020 board to accommodate changes in the ehci-omap driver. 

The patch introduces changes related to USB High-Speed (USBHS) PHY initialization and configuration for the igep0020 board. It registers the PHY's RESET regulators and the NOP PHY devices using the `usbhs_init_phys()` function. Additionally, it modifies the `usbhs_omap_platform_data` structure for the igep2 and igep3 boards to reflect the changes in port modes and GPIO configurations.

Since the patch does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Furthermore, the changes introduced in the patch seem to be specific to the igep0020 board and may not have broader applicability.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for port mirroring in the bcm_sf2 driver for DSA switches. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It does not explicitly mention fixing a bug, but rather adds support for a feature (port mirroring). Therefore, it does not meet this criterion.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   - The patch does not mention any of these issues, and it seems to be a feature addition rather than a fix for any of these problems. Therefore, it does not meet this criterion.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? 
   - The patch does not mention any trivial fixes, but it is focused on adding a new feature. Therefore, it does not meet this criterion.

Based on the analysis, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the cursor in the vmwgfx driver. The patch adds a call to "vmw_surface_unreference" when the surface is not suitable for the cursor, and returns an error code. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses an error path related to the cursor in the vmwgfx driver. While the severity of the bug is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that it is a bug that affects the functionality of the driver.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   The patch does not mention any of these issues explicitly. However, it does address an error path, indicating that it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect rendering of the cursor.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? 
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It adds a necessary call to "vmw_surface_unreference" to handle the error case.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to the cursor in the vmwgfx driver without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a superfluous check and a stray newline. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, I would classify it as a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only makes the "i40e_gstrings_stats" structure const, which does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the impact of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a security risk. Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch improves the validation of sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance values. It prevents users from directly writing negative values, which could potentially cause issues. 

The patch checks if the value can be converted to a signed 32-bit integer using the kstrtos32() function. If the conversion is successful (kstrtos32() returns 0), it further checks if the value is negative. If it is, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid input.

If the conversion fails (kstrtos32() returns a non-zero value), the patch checks if the input is "auto" or "any" and assigns the appropriate value to 'value'.

Overall, this patch addresses a potential issue by disallowing users from setting negative values directly and improves the validation of input values. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch aims to fix a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior. In IPv4, when a machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

The patch modifies the UDP error handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. When the machine receives an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that affects the behavior of UDP sockets in IPv6. It addresses a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 and ensures consistent behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the tty driver. The patch changes the return value from -ENOIOCTLCMD to -ENOTTY when a specific condition is met.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses an issue where the errno value returned in a specific scenario is incorrect. While it may not be a critical bug, it is a real issue that affects the correctness of error reporting.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue and does not introduce any new problems.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devexit_p. This function is no longer needed because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and it only removes a function that is no longer needed, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch sets the led_classdev max_brightness to the maximum level supported by hardware. This eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in brightness_set(). This change can potentially improve performance and simplify the code.

2. The patch removes the "bright_max" variable from the "struct netxbig_led_data" structure.

3. In the "netxbig_led_set" function, the patch removes the calculation of "bright_val" using the "bright_max" variable and directly sets the value to the "led_dat->bright_addr" using the "value" parameter.

4. In the "create_netxbig_led" function, the patch sets the "max_brightness" field of the led_classdev to the value of "template->bright_max".

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a performance improvement and code simplification. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific performance bottleneck issue when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch renames the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()` and moves the reference acquisition code into the renamed function. It also updates the function calls accordingly.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only involves renaming and code reorganization, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This indicates that the function is only called in functions annotated with __init, which suggests that it is used during the initialization phase of the kernel.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature.

3. The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they modify the behavior of the function and potentially free up resources after its usage.

4. The patch does not introduce any new build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to address an internal issue related to resource management during kernel initialization.

Based on these observations, the patch seems to fix a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the code to use devm_ functions. This type of change is typically considered a "trivial" fix and does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8960: Use devm_regmap_init_i2c()". It suggests using the `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` function instead of `regmap_init_i2c()` in the `wm8960_i2c_probe()` function of the `wm8960.c` file.

The patch provides the following reasons for the change:
1. `devm_regmap_init_i2c()` is device managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup.
2. There was no explicit `regmap_exit` call in the previous implementation, indicating a potential bug.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate this patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? - No, the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it fixes. It only suggests using a different function for initialization.
2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? - No, the patch does not address any of these critical issues.
3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? - No, the patch does not mention any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Anton Blanchard and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.

3. Cc: The patch is also copied to several individuals, including Ingo Molnar, Jiri Olsa, Namhyung Kim, Paul Mackerras, and Peter Zijlstra.

4. Link: The patch includes links to the original message and the reply on the LKML mailing list.

5. Code Changes: The patch modifies the vmlinux_path__init() function in the symbol.c file.

6. Code Addition: The patch adds an additional entry to the vmlinux_path array by allocating memory and copying the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

7. Code Modification: The patch modifies the size of the vmlinux_path array allocation to accommodate the additional entry.

8. Code Addition: The patch adds another entry to the vmlinux_path array by copying the path to the vmlinux file in the /lib/modules directory.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a valid fix for adding the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves code additions and modifications. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) until more information is available about the bug it addresses and its impact.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the init() and exit() platform callbacks for the imx serial driver in the imx platform code.
   - This change removes the initialization and cleanup functions for the platform device.
   - It seems that the init() and exit() functions were used to handle a specific GPIO configuration for uart0.

2. The patch replaces the moboard_uart0_init() function with moboard_uart0_init(void).
   - The new function does not take any arguments.

3. The patch removes the moboard_uart0_exit() function.
   - This function was responsible for freeing the GPIO used by uart0.

4. The patch initializes uart0_pdata with moboard_uart0_init().
   - This change initializes the platform data structure for uart0 with the new initialization function.

5. The patch calls moboard_uart0_init() in mx31moboard_init().
   - This change adds a call to the new initialization function for uart0 during board initialization.

6. The patch removes the pdata->init() call in serial_imx_probe().
   - This change removes the call to the init() function from the platform data structure.

7. The patch removes the pdata->exit() call in serial_imx_remove().
   - This change removes the call to the exit() function from the platform data structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch removes the init() and exit() platform callbacks for the imx serial driver and replaces them with a simplified initialization function. It also removes the specific GPIO configuration for uart0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a cleanup or simplification of the code rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for initializing the BBP_R103 register in the rt2800 driver. The patch adds code to set the value of BBP_R103 based on specific conditions for different chipsets.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch initializes BBP_R103 on various subroutines in the rt2800 driver, except for the 5592 chipset. This indicates that the patch aims to address a specific issue related to the initialization of BBP_R103.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

3. The changes made in the patch involve writing specific values to the BBP_R103 register for different chipsets. This suggests that the patch is addressing a hardware-specific issue related to the initialization of BBP_R103.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether the patch fixes a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Without more context or information about the specific bug being addressed, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.

However, assuming that the patch does fix a critical bug related to the initialization of BBP_R103, and it meets the other criteria mentioned earlier, it would be reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sizeimage setting in the coda driver for media devices. The patch updates the calculation of sizeimage in the vidioc_try_fmt and vidioc_s_fmt functions.

The original code incorrectly calculated sizeimage as the product of height and bytesperline, instead of width, height, and the factor 3/2 for YUV420 format. The patch corrects this calculation by using width, height, and the factor 3/2.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to fix a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect image sizes. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend a NAK (not accepting) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch appears to be related to the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset.
2. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro with module_param_named and MODULE_PARM_DESC for setting the tx_buffers parameter.
3. It also adds a check to ensure that the user does not set tx_buffer beyond the defined limits of the driver.
4. The patch modifies the device_set_options function to set the number of TX buffers based on the value of vnt_tx_buffers.
5. It also adds a similar check for the number of RX buffers.

Reasoning for NAK:

1. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
2. It appears to be a trivial fix related to parameter handling and does not address any significant issues.
3. The patch does not provide any justification for why this change is necessary or what problem it solves.
4. There is a mistake in the patch where module_param_named is used with vnt_rx_buffers instead of vnt_tx_buffers, which suggests a lack of thorough review.

Overall, the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it does not fix a critical bug and contains trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve replacing the usage of non-device managed APIs with their device managed counterparts. While this change may improve code simplicity and resource management, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend it not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function call with a recommended one. The change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to avoid an unnecessary register read in the i40e_virtchnl_pf.c file.

2. Change-Id: The Change-Id is a unique identifier for the patch, which helps track changes in the codebase. It does not provide any information about the nature of the patch.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers, indicating their agreement with the changes made.

4. Tested-by: The patch has been tested by Sibai Li, indicating that it has undergone testing.

5. Code Changes: The code changes involve removing the unnecessary register read and using the vf_base_id from the hw->func_caps structure instead.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial optimization to avoid unnecessary register reads.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary.
2. The function scsi_run_queue is split into two parts: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue.
3. The scsi_starved_list_run function is responsible for selecting a proper request queue to serve next.
4. The scsi_run_queue function is responsible for starting a new command if possible.
5. The scsi_single_lun_run function is called if the scsi_target has a single LUN.
6. The scsi_starved_list_run function is called if the starved_list is not empty.
7. Finally, the blk_run_queue function is called.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the efficiency of scsi_run_queue by avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and splitting the function into more clear parts. It also handles single LUN and starved_list scenarios appropriately.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential performance improvement and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on code cleanup and renaming functions for aesthetics. It does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field from the "sl811h_driver" structure in the "sl811-hcd.c" file. The patch claims to fix the "platform_no_drv_owner.cocci" warnings.

Since this patch only removes a single line of code and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ARM: amba: netx: get rid of NO_IRQ initializers." This suggests that it aims to remove the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field of the amba_device structure in the netx driver.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the .irq field is modified from ".irq = { NETX_IRQ_LCD, NO_IRQ }" to ".irq = { NETX_IRQ_LCD }". This change removes the NO_IRQ initializer.

3. The patch does not provide any additional context or explanation for the change.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is removing the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field in the netx driver. However, without further context or explanation, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose or impact of this change.

Since the patch does not appear to fix a real and critical bug, and it seems to be a trivial change (removing an initializer), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the SPI bus clocks from the platform data. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function called `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0 immediately.

3. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device corresponding to the given `ifindex`.

4. If the device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the master index of the device.

5. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index.

6. Additionally, the patch includes a duplicate definition of the `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` function with a different implementation that always returns 0. This duplicate definition should be removed.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be adding a necessary helper function to lookup the l3mdev master index by device index. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to address a real issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), with the removal of the duplicate definition of `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index`.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an uninitialized variable warning.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is specific to the Realtek ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems. It does not address a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug fix.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for enabling MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) for the rt2x00pci driver in the Linux kernel. 

Enabling MSI can improve performance and reduce interrupt latency for PCIe devices. However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a type mismatch issue in the `capi20_manufacturer` function. The function is declared with an `unsigned int` argument, but it is called with an `unsigned long` argument. This type mismatch can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or bugs.
2. The patch corrects the function prototype to match the actual argument type used in the function call. This ensures that the function is correctly defined and used as part of the user-visible API.
3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating that it has undergone a review process.
4. The issue was spotted with Coverity, which suggests that it has been identified as a potential problem that needs to be addressed.

   No, the patch does not mention fixing any specific bug. It seems to be adding a feature or enabling a capability.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the function `hdmi_probe_pdata()` in the `hdmi.c` file of the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. The function currently lacks proper error handling, which can lead to resource allocation failures and subsequent issues.

The patch modifies the function signature from `void` to `int`, indicating that it will now return an error code. This change allows for proper error propagation and handling.

Within the function, several error conditions are checked. If the `plat_dssdev` is not found, the function returns 0, indicating success. If `dss_alloc_and_init_device()` fails to allocate memory for `dssdev`, the function returns -ENOMEM, indicating an out-of-memory error.

Additionally, if `omapdss_output_set_device()` fails to connect the output to the new device, the function returns the error code `r`. Similarly, if `dss_add_device()` fails to add the device, the function returns the error code `r`.

In case of any error, the function performs necessary cleanup actions, such as unsetting the output device, uninitializing the display, and releasing the device.

Finally, in the `omapdss_hdmihw_probe()` function, the `hdmi_probe_pdata()` function is called. If it returns an error code, the necessary cleanup actions are performed, and the function returns the error code `r`.

Overall, this patch adds proper error handling to the `hdmi_probe_pdata()` function, ensuring that errors are propagated correctly and necessary cleanup actions are taken. It addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to resource allocation failures and potential issues with the HDMI driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for spurious interrupts on SDIO controllers found on Marvell Kirkwood SoCs. The patch checks if any interrupts are expected and bails out early if not. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a workaround for a non-harmful issue related to spurious interrupts.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. The patch modifies the qla2x00_gpn_id, qla2x00_gnn_id, and qla2x00_gfpn_id functions to stop iteration after the first failure. This change is made by introducing a break statement after setting the rval variable to QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED.

Since the patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause failures in the GPN_ID, GNN_ID, and GFPN_ID operations, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing inline wrappers for nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64 functions in the netlink subsystem. These functions allow retrieving the payload of __le32 and __le64 netlink attributes respectively.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some unused #defines from the wlan_bssdef.h file in the staging driver for the rtl8723au wireless chipset. The removed #defines are related to NDIS_802_11_STATUS_TYPE and authentication/integrity fields.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to refactor the soft_offline_page() function in the mm/memory-failure.c file. It addresses the issue of multiple return points randomly intermingled with some "goto done" return points. The patch adjusts the function structure to have separate paths for success and failure, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, the patch replaces the use of atomic_long_add with atomic_long_inc, which is a more appropriate function for incrementing atomic long variables.

The changes made in the patch do not fall under the category of trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they improve the code structure and address potential issues related to soft offline of memory pages.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary out-of-memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for checking the return values of nla_parse() in various functions in the nl80211.c file.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any of the mentioned issues explicitly.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to VLAN handling in the i40e driver for Intel Ethernet devices. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions to prevent them from operating when the VLAN ID (VID) is less than 1 or when the Port VLAN ID (PVID) is set. Additionally, the patch updates the function parameters to use u16 instead of s16.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code improvement to prevent unintended behavior when handling VLANs.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `cpia1.c` file of the `gspca` driver in the `media` subsystem. The patch converts a nonnegative error return code to a negative one, which is consistent with the error handling convention in the function.

Since the patch addresses a real bug by correcting an error return code, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the NVRAM location from 14 to 16 for reading the SCSI host ID. This change is based on documentation and confirmed by testing.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for enabling the TX wakeup bit in the wer register for OMAP2+ UART.
   - This is not a critical bug fix, but rather a feature enhancement. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

2. The patch also restores the wer register when context is lost.
   - This is not a critical bug fix either, but rather a context restoration improvement. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

3. The patch includes changes to the uart_omap_port structure, adding a new member "wer" and "features".
   - These changes are not critical bug fixes but rather additions to the data structure. They do not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

4. The patch modifies the serial_omap_startup function to enable the TX wakeup bit in the wer register if the feature is supported.
   - This change is related to the feature enhancement mentioned earlier and does not fix a critical bug. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

5. The patch modifies the omap_serial_fill_features_erratas function to set the OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP feature flag for certain UART revisions.
   - This change is related to the feature enhancement mentioned earlier and does not fix a critical bug. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

6. The patch modifies the serial_omap_restore_context function to restore the wer register.
   - This change is related to the context restoration improvement mentioned earlier and does not fix a critical bug. It does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. (NAK)

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch adds a new netdev operation to allow or prevent a specific Virtual Function (VF) from querying its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It also limits the support for this feature to 82599 and x540 devices only, with plans to add support for other devices later.

The changes made by the patch include adding a new boolean variable `rss_query_enabled` to the `vf_data_storage` structure in `ixgbe.h`. In `ixgbe_main.c`, the `ixgbe_configure_virtualization` function is modified to enable or disable the RSS query feature for each VF. Additionally, the `ixgbe_netdev_ops` structure in `ixgbe_main.c` is updated to include the new netdev operation `ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en`. In `ixgbe_sriov.c`, the `__ixgbe_enable_sriov` function is modified to set the `rss_query_enabled` variable to 0 for all VFs. Finally, the `ixgbe_ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en` function is added to `ixgbe_sriov.h` to handle the setting of the `rss_query_enabled` variable.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch introduces a new feature to control the ability of VFs to query their RSS information. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the decision for this Linux kernel patch is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to clock gating in the sunxi-mmc driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that the MMC core assumes the clock will be gated when the bus frequency is set to 0, which has been ignored so far. This suggests that there might be a bug or an issue related to clock handling.

2. The patch adds a check to gate the clock when the bus frequency (ios->clock) is set to 0. This ensures that the clock is properly gated when required.

3. The patch also includes a check for a specific configuration (8 bit DDR with MMC_BUS_WIDTH_8) that requires a higher module clock. This indicates that the patch addresses a specific scenario where clock handling needs to be adjusted.

4. In the sunxi_mmc_set_ios() function, the patch removes the check for ios->clock in the clock setup section and only keeps the check for ios->power_mode. This change suggests that the clock setup should be performed regardless of the clock frequency, as long as the power mode is set.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential issue related to clock gating in the sunxi-mmc driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect clock handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip. The patch increases the total number of interrupts from 8 to 34, which aligns with the three different interrupt ranges handled by the TWL4030 (8 for the core, 8 for power events, and 18 for GPIOs).

Since this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 chip, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is extending the frequency range of the Max2165 tuner driver to cover Hong Kong's digital TV broadcasting, specifically RTHK TV at 802MHz. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical bug. It is simply extending the frequency range to accommodate a specific TV channel in Hong Kong. 

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. 

My decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a configuration issue related to antenna diversity for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. The patch checks the chip type and sets different values accordingly.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a configuration issue that affects non-AR9485 chips, which can impact the performance and functionality of the wireless driver.

   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? 
   No, the patch modifies the values used for antenna diversity configuration based on the chip type, which is not a trivial fix.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to parenthesis alignment in the ppdev driver. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a real issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if this patch has been tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers and if it has been successfully applied and tested on the affected platforms.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing a macro and replacing it with local variables. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the fec driver in the Linux kernel. It introduces a new property, "phy-reset-duration," which allows boards to specify the duration of the phy reset in their device tree. This is important because different boards may require different reset durations.

The patch also includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not longer than 1 second, as a longer duration would be considered invalid. If the "phy-reset-duration" property is not present, the default duration of 1 millisecond is used.

Since this patch addresses a real issue and provides a necessary enhancement, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting pointer math to array access. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the "nct7802_regmap_config" struct in the "nct7802" driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves enabling and disabling interrupts in the meson-gx-mmc driver. The patch removes the code that clears, acknowledges, and enables interrupts in the meson_mmc_request function, and instead enables interrupts in the meson_mmc_probe function and disables interrupts in the meson_mmc_remove function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb_probe() function. The "__devinit" attribute is used to mark functions that are only called during device initialization and can be discarded after that. However, since the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option is going away, the "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed.

Given that this patch only removes a deprecated attribute and does not fix any real or critical bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compile warning in the ARM architecture's PSCI implementation. The change simply adds a return statement with a value of 0 to the `psci_init` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve dropping unneeded checks and removing some conditional statements. Since the patch does not address any specific issue or bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch is simply optimizing the code by avoiding redundant function calls. Since it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant type casting. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture. The patch modifies the code to use the `of_read_number` function instead of directly accessing the device tree properties as `u32` pointers.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not seem to be trivial, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointer to the `musb` structure from the `tusb_omap_dma` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or significant improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the functions `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves making these functions static, which is a trivial change, I would classify it as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a line length issue in the serqt_usb2.c file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a few missing clocks for different MIPS platforms. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential issue with the order of operations in the dsa_slave_create() function. The patch ensures that the netdev is registered before connecting the phy, which avoids an info message with an uninitialized name.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch replaces the direct comparison of jiffies with a more robust function, time_before, which is designed for comparing jiffies against other values.

Since this change improves the reliability and correctness of the code, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not fall into the category of trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the struct device pointer to point to the USB device instead of the input device. This change does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the BUG_ON statement from the mmc_ext_csd_open function in the debugfs.c file. Instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch returns an error value to the caller if the condition n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN is not met.

The reasoning behind this change is that the author believes that the condition n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN is unlikely to happen. By returning an error value instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch ensures that the error is properly propagated to the caller.

Since the patch replaces a BUG_ON with proper error handling, it does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Additionally, it does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by improving the error handling in the code.

Therefore, while the patch does not meet the criteria for fixing a critical bug, it can still be considered for inclusion in a stable release as it improves the code's robustness and maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the attribute index for temperature sensors in the ixgbe driver.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "[media] v4l: Casting (void *) value returned by kmalloc is useless". This suggests that the patch is addressing a casting issue related to the kmalloc function in the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem.

2. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the code in the vino_allocate_buffer function in the vino.c file. Specifically, it removes the unnecessary casting of the return value of kmalloc.

3. Analysis: The patch addresses a casting issue that does not have any functional impact on the code. It does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical bug. Instead, it focuses on improving code readability and removing unnecessary code.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup or a non-functional code change.

Therefore, the answer is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a single line of code. The change removes the "filter_relative" option from the symbol_conf structure in the symbol.c file.

Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, which is not suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host
   - The patch aims to handle a new MTU value when the host reduces it due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the `nvsp_message` structure in `netvsc.c` to include the new MTU value.
   - It updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function in `netvsc_drv.c` to set the limit for MTU based on the `NETVSC_MTU` value minus `ETH_HLEN`.
   - It adds code in `rndis_filter.c` to retrieve the MTU value from the host and assign it to `net_device->ndev->mtu`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses the issue of handling a reduced MTU value set by the host due to headroom reservation for encapsulation.
   - It modifies the `nvsp_message` structure to include the new MTU value, ensuring proper communication with the host.
   - It updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function to set the correct limit for MTU based on the `NETVSC_MTU` value minus `ETH_HLEN`.
   - It retrieves the MTU value from the host and assigns it to `net_device->ndev->mtu` in `rndis_filter.c`.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to handling the MTU value reduced by the host. It ensures proper communication and avoids potential issues with encapsulation. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of using the lookup table to set the baud rate only when the ioclk is 150MHz. It mentions that some boards might set ioclk to a different frequency.

2. The patch recalculates the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz.

3. The patch also includes changes to get the clk in the probe function and put it in remove.

4. The patch removes the variable "ioclk_rate" and the associated assignment.

5. The patch checks if the port's uartclk is equal to 150000000 before performing the common rate fast calculation.

6. The patch adds code to get the clk and set the port's uartclk to the clk rate in the probe function.

7. The patch includes error handling for clk_get and clk_prepare_enable.

8. The patch disables and unprepares the clk in the remove function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the baud rate calculation when the ioclk is not 150MHz. It also includes necessary changes to handle the clk in the probe and remove functions.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the baud rate calculation and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the open-coded function `_regulator_is_enabled()` with a function call. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be converting the variable `num_drc_entries` from an unsigned int to an atomic_t type. This change allows for removing the spinlocking around the variable.

Analyzing the patch against the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a performance optimization by replacing a spinlock with an atomic operation.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it exports the `confirm_error_lock` symbol so that it can be used in the PCI surprise hot remove path to freeze the affected PE. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, this patch is a non-trivial change that adds functionality to the codebase. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

In general, exporting symbols is a common practice in the Linux kernel, and if this change is necessary for the proper functioning of the PCI surprise hot remove path in the powerpc architecture, it may be considered acceptable for inclusion in a stable release.

However, as an AI, I cannot make the final decision. It is recommended to consult with the Linux kernel maintainers and the relevant community to get their input and approval before including this patch in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a formatting issue in the perf trace code. The patch adds a closing parenthesis to the fprintf statement for exit_group() in the trace__sys_enter function.

Since this patch only involves a minor formatting change and does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment in the cxgb4vf driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the "do_gro" function in the "sge.c" file of the cxgb4vf driver. It adds an increment to the "vlan_ex" counter in the "rxq->stats" structure when "pkt->vlan_ex" is true. This counter keeps track of the number of VLAN packets processed.

The change itself seems to be addressing a real issue related to VLAN extraction. It is not a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code logic and adding a counter increment. However, it does not explicitly mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It appears to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, my decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL function in the amdgpu driver. The patch adds amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in different cases of the switch statement, ensuring that the BO is properly unreserved before returning from the function.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch splits the function `media_graph_walk_next()` into two functions: `media_graph_walk_next()` and `media_graph_walk_iter()`. This is done because `media_graph_walk_next()` is becoming more complicated, especially with the addition of `has_routing()` support.

2. The `media_graph_walk_iter()` function is introduced to handle the iteration logic of the graph walk.

3. The logic inside `media_graph_walk_next()` is simplified by calling `media_graph_walk_iter()` in a loop until there are no more entities on the current level.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code refactoring or optimization. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable oprofile support on Lantiq targets. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an AUXDATA entry for the "nvidia,tegra30-ahub" device in the tegra30_auxdata_lookup array. This is necessary for clock lookups to work correctly for the Tegra30 I2S and AHUB modules.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. It falls under the category of a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup" as mentioned in the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the `finit_module` syscall in the SH architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

Since the patch is adding support for a new syscall, it does not fix a bug or address an existing issue. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the return statement from "return rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);" to "return !!rb532_get_bit(offset, gpch->regbase + GPIOD);". This change ensures that the return value is clamped to either 0 or 1.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the twl6040_power() function in the mfd/twl6040.c file. The patch checks the return value of the clk_prepare_enable() function and propagates the error in case of failure.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a potential issue in the twl6040_power() function by checking the return value of clk_prepare_enable().

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description, but based on the context, it seems that the bug could potentially lead to a hang or incorrect behavior if the clk_prepare_enable() function fails.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a necessary error handling check.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing duplicate code and using a generic function instead. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch modifies the kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page function in the arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c file. It adds a check for sp->role.invalid and is_obsolete_sp() before calling kvm_reload_remote_mmus().

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of obsolete pages in the KVM MMU. It introduces a check to prevent calling kvm_reload_remote_mmus() when the page is marked as invalid or obsolete.

Without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issue.

However, based on the information provided, it appears that this patch is not a trivial fix (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.). It introduces a logical check to improve the handling of obsolete pages in the KVM MMU.

Considering the lack of information about the bug being fixed and the absence of any obvious issues with the patch, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being fixed would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()` to disable the ISA DMA controller and return the residue. This function is useful for managing DMA operations in the comedi driver.

2. The patch modifies the `disable_dma_on_even()` function to use the new helper function `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `get_dma_residue()`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The `das16_interrupt()` function is modified to remove the unnecessary `claim_dma_lock()` and `release_dma_lock()` calls. These calls were not needed since the DMA lock is already claimed and released in the `disable_dma_on_even()` function.

4. The `das16_alloc_dma()` function is modified to use the `das16_isadma_disable()` function instead of directly calling `disable_dma()`. This change improves consistency and code readability.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to managing DMA operations in the comedi driver. It introduces a new helper function and improves the existing code. The changes are not trivial and do not involve spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a function called `add_temp_sensors` which scans temperature sources used for fan control and reports if additional monitoring registers are available. This indicates that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to temperature monitoring.

2. The `add_temp_sensors` function iterates over the temperature sources and checks if there are any additional monitoring registers available. If available, it enables monitoring for those registers.

3. The `add_temp_sensors` function is then called twice in the `nct6775_probe` function to find unmonitored temperature registers and enable monitoring if additional registers are available. This ensures that all temperature sources are properly monitored.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug related to temperature monitoring in the `nct6775` driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the machine could be killed due to an incorrect USB endpoint type. Instead of triggering a BUG(), the patch replaces it with a dev_WARN() call to warn about the unknown endpoint type and continue execution.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue but does not fall into the category of a "real and critical bug." Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that it fixes a vendor command interface issue. This suggests that it addresses a specific bug or problem.

2. The patch includes reviewed-by and signed-off-by tags from individuals who are likely familiar with the codebase and have reviewed the changes. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review.

3. Looking at the code changes, it seems that the patch modifies the handling of vendor commands in the brcmfmac driver. It changes the way the interface is determined, using the interface supplied by the caller instead of the main interface. This change is made by introducing new variables `vif` and `ifp` and updating the relevant function calls.

4. The code changes appear to be focused on addressing a specific issue related to the vendor command handling. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and specific issue in the brcmfmac driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix a bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the code. The patch suggests holding the spinlock for a shorter duration by moving the spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_unlock_irqrestore() calls inside the loop. This change aims to reduce the time the spinlock is held, potentially improving performance and reducing contention.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: mxs: correct 'direction' of device_prep_dma_cyclic". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the 'direction' parameter in the mxs driver for the ASoC subsystem.

2. Looking at the commit message, it mentions that commit 49920bc changed the type of the 'direction' parameter from dma_data_direction to dma_transfer_direction in the device_prep_dma_cyclic function.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

4. In the code changes, we can see that the 'direction' parameter is updated from DMA_TO_DEVICE to DMA_MEM_TO_DEV for the SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK case.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the 'direction' parameter in the mxs driver. However, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the change seems to be a relatively trivial fix rather than a critical one.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it suggests printing a message to let the user know they could try using "pci=realloc" if some PCI device resources are unassigned. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is more of an informational patch to provide a suggestion to the user.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing static storage class specifiers in the udl_connector.c file. The patch addresses sparse warnings related to undeclared symbols and suggests making certain functions and structures static.

   The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups?
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the driver does not pass the number of tasks to the QM (Queue Manager) init logic. This can cause back-pressure in scenarios requiring many tasks, leading to reduced performance.

2. Impact: The issue described in the patch can potentially impact performance in scenarios where a large number of tasks are required, such as when using maximum MRs (Memory Regions). This suggests that it could be a real and critical bug affecting system performance.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the `qed_qm_init_pf` function in the `qed_cxt.c` file. It adds a new parameter, `num_tids`, to the `params` structure and assigns it the value of `iids.tids`. This change ensures that the number of tasks is passed to the QM init logic.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can impact system performance. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a failure in adding a route when a nonsensical route is added, resulting in incorrect route lookup and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes a specific issue related to locally assigned nexthop addresses in IPv6 routing.

1. Patch description: "drm/tegra: sor - Fix copy/paste error"
   This indicates that the patch aims to fix a copy/paste error in the sor.c file.

2. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the value assignment in the tegra_output_sor_enable() function.
   Specifically, it corrects a copy/paste error in the line:
   `value = SOR_CSTM_LVDS | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B | SOR_CSTM_UPPER;`
   The corrected line is:
   `value = SOR_CSTM_LVDS | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_A | SOR_CSTM_LINK_ACT_B | SOR_CSTM_UPPER;`

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a copy/paste error in the code, which suggests that it is a bug fix.
   However, this bug does not seem to cause any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
   It appears to be a non-critical issue related to incorrect comments and code alignment.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch seems to be a trivial fix that does not address a critical bug or issue. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes a build error on arm64 architecture, which is a real and critical bug. The error is caused by the undeclared 'PERF_REGS_MAX' variable in the 'util/event.h' file. The patch adds the missing definition of 'PERF_REGS_MAX' for arm64, resolving the build error.

Since the build error can prevent the kernel from being built on arm64, it qualifies as a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch is a trivial fix that initializes the boolean variable 'found' to false. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (initializing a variable), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be given a NAK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a compiler warning related to a debug print statement in the iommu.c file. The change replaces the existing line:

`(unsigned long)paddr, pgsize);`

with:

`(unsigned long)paddr, (unsigned long)pgsize);`

This change adds explicit type casting for the `pgsize` variable.

Since this patch only addresses a compiler warning and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions in the MIPS tlbex code. The bug was introduced by commit c5b367835cfc, which assumed a constant offset for certain PTE bits, but this assumption is no longer true for some MIPS32R2 builds due to commit be0c37c985ed.

The patch addresses this issue by using the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask instead of hardcoding values. It also includes the necessary fixes for both build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause build errors or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes made in the patch are simply replacing the usage of the `greybus_set_drvdata` function with direct assignment to the `gdev->gb_tty` field.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that defines a constant for the LRW block size and replaces the usage of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` with the defined constant. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only renames an argument in the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map`. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds additional fields to be recognized by the WACOM_PEN_FIELD and WACOM_FINGER_FIELD macros in the wacom_wac.h file. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to setting the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag in the clone_mnt function in fs/namespace.c. The patch checks if the CL_EXPIRE flag is set and if the old->mnt_expire list is empty before setting the MNT_LOCKED flag in mnt->mnt.mnt_flags.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

From the patch, it seems that the fix is related to preventing unprivileged users from revealing what is under a mount. It checks if the CL_UNPRIVILEGED flag is set and if the CL_EXPIRE flag is not set or if the old->mnt_expire list is empty before setting the MNT_LOCKED flag. This indicates that the patch addresses a security issue by ensuring that unprivileged users cannot access certain mount points.

Considering that the patch addresses a real security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a quirk for the ASUS X75VD laptop to fix Wi-Fi functionality. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a Wi-Fi issue on the ASUS X75VD laptop, which can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   No, the patch does not seem to introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? 
   No, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a prefix to the print format in the asymmetric key signature handling code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses warnings reported by the compiler when building the microblaze architecture's kgdb.c file. These warnings indicate a comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions, which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. 

The patch resolves the issue by changing the loop counter variable from a signed integer (int) to an unsigned integer (unsigned int) in three functions: pt_regs_to_gdb_regs, gdb_regs_to_pt_regs, and sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs. This change ensures that the loop counter is of the correct type for the comparison, eliminating the warnings.

Since the patch fixes a real issue (compiler warnings) and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a warning that occurs during the kernel build with W=1. The warning is related to a missing prototype for the function 'ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg' in the ql4_nx.c file of the qla4xxx SCSI driver. The patch marks this function as static, as it is only used within the file and does not require a declaration.

Since the patch fixes a build error and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces two new knobs, idgen_retries and idgen_delay, for IPv6 address generation. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. 

The patch modifies the netns_sysctl_ipv6 structure in include/net/netns/ipv6.h to include the new knobs idgen_retries and idgen_delay. It also modifies the initialization of these knobs in inet6_net_init() function in net/ipv6/af_inet6.c and adds corresponding entries in the ipv6_table_template and ipv6_table structures in net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c.

In addrconf_dad_failure() function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch replaces the hardcoded values of idgen_retries and idgen_delay with the values from the net->ipv6.sysctl structure.

In ipv6_generate_stable_address() function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch replaces the hardcoded value of idgen_retries with the value from dev_net(idev->dev)->ipv6.sysctl structure.

Overall, this patch introduces new knobs for IPv6 address generation and makes use of these knobs in relevant functions. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that involves a declaration move and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch addresses the issue of retasked jacks being counted as the target for automatic jack switching when their direction is different. It avoids automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is expected.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a fix for a specific behavior related to jack detection and retasking.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix that does not address a severe issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a build error by adding a missing declaration of the `cmpxchg64` function. Since the error is related to a missing function declaration, it does not appear to fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch would be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. The patch calculates the location of query 8 dynamically instead of hardcoding the offset. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. It seems to be a non-trivial fix that improves the code's flexibility and maintainability. However, it does not address any critical bug or issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code reorganization and does not fix any real and critical bug or address any specific issue mentioned in the criteria. It seems to be a clean-up or optimization change rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported in the zl10353 driver for DVB frontends. The patch changes the calculation of the SNR value from a raw hardware register value to a value in a 0.1 dB scale.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC interrupt controller driver. The changes include adding more register documentation and defining register addresses.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds documentation and register definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a "line over 80" issue by removing a comment. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. 

Since a build error can prevent the kernel from being compiled and used, it can be considered a critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi driver. The patch modifies the if condition by changing the logical OR operator (||) to a logical AND operator (&&). 

The original if condition checks if the sscanf function successfully reads an integer from the buf string and if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the patch changes the logical OR operator to a logical AND operator, which means that the condition will only be true if both the sscanf function fails to read an integer and the mode is not equal to 2 or 1.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch introduces a logical error. The intention of the patch is likely to ensure that the mode variable is either 2 or 1, but the modified condition will always evaluate to true. This means that the function will always return -EINVAL, regardless of the value of mode.

Considering that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather introduces a logical error, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro. The change itself does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for the wil6210 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds debug prints for vring deallocation in the `wil_vring_free` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves some variables from one file to another. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains some trivial changes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to avoid common clk framework warnings. This change seems to be a non-trivial fix.

2. In the `atmel_usba_start` function, the patch modifies the code to use `clk_prepare_enable` instead of `clk_enable` for `udc->pclk` and `udc->hclk`. It also adds error handling in case `clk_prepare_enable` fails. This change ensures that the clock is properly prepared before enabling it.

3. In the `atmel_usba_stop` function, the patch replaces `clk_disable` with `clk_disable_unprepare` for `udc->hclk` and `udc->pclk`. This change ensures that the clock is properly disabled and unprepared.

4. In the `usba_udc_probe` function, the patch modifies the code to use `clk_prepare_enable` instead of `clk_enable` for `pclk`. It also adds error handling in case `clk_prepare_enable` fails. This change ensures that the clock is properly prepared before enabling it.

Based on the analysis, this patch seems to fix a real issue related to clock handling in the `atmel_usba` gadget driver. It addresses potential warnings and ensures proper clock preparation and disabling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __func__ argument from the dev_err function calls in the gdm72xx driver. This change removes the specific instance of the device from the log printout.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the final fixups from the __init section to the __devinit section.
   - This change suggests that the final fixups are executed during device enumeration, which may occur after boot if hotplug is supported.
   - Moving the final fixups to the __devinit section indicates that they cannot be executed during the initialization phase (__init) and need to be deferred until device enumeration.

2. The patch includes a changelog and is signed-off by the authors.
   - The changelog provides information about the patch's purpose and changes made.
   - The sign-off indicates that the authors have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. The patch modifies the quirk_amd_nb_node function in the quirks.c file.
   - The function is currently defined as "__init" and is changed to "__devinit".

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to final fixups during device enumeration. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make a final decision, additional information about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it falls under the categories of critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues would be necessary.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the Acer Aspire 5741 model. The patch adds the necessary quirk to the video_vendor_dmi_table to address the broken ACPI-video backlight control for this particular model.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects a specific hardware model, it can be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. However, to make a final decision, further analysis is required, such as reviewing the bug report and considering any potential side effects or regressions that the patch may introduce.

Therefore, the initial decision would be (A) to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), pending further analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that allows the inclusion of the ".GCC.command.line" section in modules to prevent modpost warnings. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, specifically for the sense buffer and scatter-gather (SG) list mapping.

2. In the function `advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma`, the patch checks for a DMA mapping error using `dma_mapping_error`. If an error occurs, it logs a debug message and returns 0.

3. In the function `asc_build_req`, the patch checks if the sense buffer mapping failed and returns `ASC_BUSY` if so.

4. In the same function, the patch also checks for an SG list mapping failure and returns `ASC_BUSY` if it fails. It logs a debug message in case of failure.

5. In the function `adv_build_req`, similar error checking is added for the sense buffer mapping and SG list mapping.

6. In the function `asc_execute_scsi_cmnd`, if `asc_build_req` returns an error (not `ASC_NOERROR`), the function returns the error code.

Overall, the patch adds necessary error handling for DMA mapping failures in the advansys driver. It addresses potential issues that could lead to build errors, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch adds a warning to catch the case where an object larger than 43 bits is created, which could lead to crashes later on. This bug could potentially cause data corruption or system instability.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the function signature and adding a warning message.

3. The patch does not introduce any new issues: The changes made in the patch are straightforward and do not introduce any new risks or regressions.

4. The patch has been reviewed: The patch has been reviewed by Tvrtko Ursulin, which adds credibility to its correctness and effectiveness.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a debug level for channel context in the ath9k driver.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve converting the wm8776 codec driver to use table-based control and DAPM initialization.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds two new registers, `rimsc` and `fimsc`, to the `struct nmk_gpio_chip` in the `gpio-nomadik.c` file. These registers are used to cache values from the GPIO controller.

2. In the `__nmk_gpio_set_mode_safe` function, instead of reading the values from the GPIO controller, the patch uses the cached values `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the `nmk_chip` structure.

3. In the `__nmk_gpio_irq_modify` function, the patch introduces changes to handle different types of interrupts (`WAKE` and `NORMAL`). It uses the cached values `rimsc` and `fimsc` from the `nmk_chip` structure to set or clear the corresponding bits in the GPIO controller registers.

4. In the `nmk_gpio_wakeups_suspend` function, the patch removes the unnecessary reading of `rwimsc` and `fwimsc` from the GPIO controller. Instead, it directly uses the cached values from the `nmk_chip` structure to update the GPIO controller registers.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a performance optimization by caching register values. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Instead, this patch seems to be adding functionality to parse out the ECC (Error Correction Code) information for full-id NAND chips. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes some local functions and replaces them with existing helper functions. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a parameter from the function s_cbFillTxBufHead in the vt6655 driver. The patch replaces the usage of the parameter *pPacket with the locally available skb->data. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adds the "const" qualifier to the "ab8500_cell" structure in the "db8500_prcmu_register_ab8500" function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup. As per the guidelines, patches with trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the uvcvideo driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations for the videobuf2 queue, moving the video enable/disable code to these operations.

The patch also includes changes to the uvc_queue_enable function, removing the video enable/disable calls and moving them to the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations.

Overall, this patch seems to address a real issue related to stream start/stop control in the uvcvideo driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as hangs or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability and does not introduce any functional changes. It changes the return type of the function `is_file_hugepages()` from `int` to `bool` and simplifies the implementation by removing an unnecessary if condition.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the "frontend" extra MSR on Skylake in the JSON conversion. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a POSTING_READ macro call to keep the cached values in sync with the hardware. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an interface to get the DMA frame and instruction buffer (IB) size for the amdgpu ring. This can be useful for properly calculating space on the ring for IB submissions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "__always_unused" attribute to the "filter_mask" parameter in the "i40e_ndo_bridge_getlink" function. This change indicates that the "filter_mask" parameter is intentionally unused and avoids compiler warnings.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a single line of code to acknowledge the TX done interrupt in "level mode" for the nps_enet driver. While this may be necessary for certain simulators of the device, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an endian bug in the cpufreq cooling code. The bug causes incorrect values to be stored in the high bits of an unsigned long on big endian systems. 

The patch changes the data type of the "count" variable from unsigned long to unsigned int to ensure correct storage of values. It also updates the function call to "get_property" to pass the address of the "count" variable correctly.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can lead to incorrect behavior on big endian systems, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a global variable and moves it into the errata configuration function. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK). The patch appears to add soft reset controller support for STiH415 and includes new softreset lines required for other device tree nodes in the header file. However, it does not specify any real and critical bug that it fixes or any issues it addresses.

To make a decision, I would need more information about the purpose and impact of this patch. Specifically, I would need to know if it addresses any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Without this additional information, I cannot determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of the hash function in the sch_fq.c file.
2. The patch replaces the existing hash_32() function with hash_ptr() for 64-bit architectures.
3. The reason for this change is that the author, Eric Dumazet, initially chose hash_32() due to performance issues with hash_ptr() on 64-bit architectures.
4. However, Linus Torvalds and George Spelvin have fixed the performance issues with hash_ptr(), making it a better choice for 64-bit architectures with large amounts of memory.
5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and also includes Cc to Hugh Dickins.
6. The patch modifies the fq_classify() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the fq_root array.
7. The patch also modifies the fq_rehash() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the new_array.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a performance issue and improving the hash function usage on 64-bit architectures with large memory sizes. It does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: arche-apb: Don't use gpio after failing to request it." This suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to the greybus driver for the arche-apb controller.

2. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from the author, Viresh Kumar, and a reviewed-by line from Vaibhav Hiremath. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of review.

3. The patch modifies the `apb_ctrl_init_seq` function in the `arche-apb-ctrl.c` file.

4. The code block being modified checks if a specific GPIO pin (`apb->clk_en_gpio`) is valid and attempts to request it using `devm_gpio_request()`. If the request fails, a warning message is printed.

5. Currently, even if the GPIO request fails, the code proceeds to set the direction of the GPIO pin using `gpio_direction_output()`. If this call also fails, another warning message is printed.

6. The patch modifies the code to only attempt to set the direction of the GPIO pin if the request was successful. This ensures that the direction is not set if the GPIO request fails.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where the direction of a GPIO pin is set even after a failed request. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The patch fixes this by only setting the direction if the request was successful.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `fuse_file_fallocate()` function in the `fs/fuse/file.c` file.

2. The change replaces the line `struct inode *inode = file->f_inode;` with `struct inode *inode = file_inode(file);`.

3. The `file_inode()` function is used to obtain the `inode` pointer from the `file` structure. This function is preferred over directly accessing `file->f_inode` as it provides better code readability and maintainability.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves code readability without addressing any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ath9k: Check beaconing mode properly"
   - The patch title suggests that the patch is intended to fix an issue related to beaconing mode in the ath9k driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - In MCC (Multi-Channel Concurrency) mode, the Time Synchronization Function (TSF) of a context needs to be adjusted only if it is a Group Owner/Access Point (GO/AP).
   - The patch adds a check to verify if the previous channel switch was scheduled after a beacon transmission. If not, it returns without adjusting the TSF.
   - The patch includes the necessary code changes to implement this check.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Sujith Manoharan and John W. Linville, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to beaconing mode in the ath9k driver. It introduces a check to ensure that the TSF adjustment is only performed when necessary. Since this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect TSF adjustment, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that upgrades the sched_clock interface from 32-bit to 64-bit. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed functions that automatically handle resource cleanup. This helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

The changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they involve using devm_kzalloc() to allocate memory and devm_hwmon_device_register() to register the hwmon device. These changes are not trivial and can potentially fix real and critical bugs.

The patch also includes error handling and cleanup code, which is important for maintaining code integrity and preventing resource leaks.

Overall, the patch seems to address a real issue and improves the code by using managed functions and proper error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary function call. The removed function call does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a lockdep_assert_held() call in the fence_signal_locked() function of the dma-buf/fence.c file. This lockdep_assert_held() call is used to verify that the lock associated with the fence object is held when the function is called.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the camellia module to camellia_generic. This change allows optimized assembler implementations to autoload with module-alias.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch modifies the default RSS (Receive Side Scaling) table distribution over the rings of the close NUMA node, enforcing preference for close rings over far ones.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the use of typedef ctl_table to struct ctl_table. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new definitions for ATPX in the AMDGPU driver. These definitions include ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only adds new definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `check_flush_dependency` which checks for flush dependency sanity.
2. The `check_flush_dependency` function is called in two places: in the `flush_workqueue` function and in the `start_flush_work` function.
3. The purpose of the `check_flush_dependency` function is to verify that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items.
4. If the target workqueue does not have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set, the function triggers a warning using `WARN_ONCE`.
5. The warning message includes information about the current task or work item, the target workqueue, and the target work item.
6. The patch also adds a call to `check_flush_dependency` in the `flush_workqueue` function before unlocking the workqueue mutex.
7. Finally, the patch adds a call to `check_flush_dependency` in the `start_flush_work` function before inserting the work item into the workqueue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where memory reclaim tries to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items, which can lead to a deadlock. The patch adds a warning to detect such conditions and prevent the deadlock from occurring.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential deadlock issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the FPU type for ColdFire MMU platforms. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not introduce any significant functional changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the incorrect use of `sizeof` in the `rtsx_probe()` function in the `rtsx.c` file of the staging driver for the rts5208 device. The patch replaces `sizeof(dev->chip)` with `sizeof(*dev->chip)` to correctly allocate memory for the `dev->chip` structure.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `handle_IRQ` with `handle_domain_irq` in the `sa1100_handle_irq` function. This change is aimed at automatically mapping the hardware IRQ number to a virtual IRQ.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the Intel D525MW mainboard. The patch adds a DMI entry to quirk away the phantom LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) header on this mainboard.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a bug reported in the bug tracker (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65256). This indicates that there is a real issue that needs to be fixed.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues. However, it is possible that the presence of the phantom LVDS header on the Intel D525MW mainboard could cause confusion or misconfiguration, leading to unexpected behavior or issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch adds a specific DMI entry to address the issue, which is not considered a trivial fix.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug related to the Intel D525MW mainboard and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, it is important to note that further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the verbosity of the debugging output in the turbostat tool. It modifies the dump_cnt() function to only print the counters that are active, rather than printing all counters regardless of their value.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to firmware UCODE_ID_STORAGE in the virtualization environment for Tonga. The patch allocates a BO (buffer object) and provides the BO's mc address to the hardware to prevent a hang on VFs (virtual functions).

The patch also includes a fix for coding style and has been reviewed and acknowledged by several individuals.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could cause a hang in the virtualization environment. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the ftgmac100 hardware revision in the Aspeed AST2500. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc by introducing a new member `rx_pages` in the `struct ftgmac100` and modifies the functions `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page`, `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page`, `ftgmac100_rx_packet`, `ftgmac100_alloc_rx_page`, and `ftgmac100_free_buffers` to use this new member.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the ftgmac100 hardware revision, which could potentially lead to corruption.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - Yes, the patch aims to prevent corruption by separating the rx page storage from rxdesc.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch introduces significant changes to the code by adding a new member and modifying multiple functions.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch are related to the return value of seq_printf and converting it to check seq_has_overflowed instead. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to debug logs in the Bluetooth subsystem. The issue is that the expected and actual key counts were mixed up in the debug logs. The patch corrects this by swapping the values in the log messages.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause confusion or misinterpretation of debug logs, it can be considered a valid fix. However, it does not seem to fix a critical issue that causes a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the fix does not involve any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix for an issue that could potentially cause confusion. As such, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to improve the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the tas5086 codec driver.

2. Code Changes: The code changes involve modifying the tas5086_set_deemph() function in the tas5086.c file.

3. Logic Improvement: The patch introduces a slight improvement in the logic by breaking out of the loop if the rate is matched. This change allows for faster selection of the de-emphasis sampling rate.

4. Code Review: The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Daniel Mack, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch improves the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the tas5086 codec driver without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a configuration option related to DMA in the addi-data drivers. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the `comedi_driver_unregister()` function to call `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` instead of `comedi_dev_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver. This change increments the reference count to prevent the device from being removed while it is being checked to see if it is attached to the driver.

2. After the check, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

3. The patch also includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue related to device removal while being checked for attachment to the driver. This could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a generic compatible string for the "hix5hd2" SoC name, which improves the clarity and compatibility of the ethernet driver.

2. The patch updates the "compatible" property to include the SoC strings "hisilicon,hix5hd2-gemac" and "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-gemac", as well as the version strings "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v1" and "hisilicon,hisi-gemac-v2". This ensures that the driver is compatible with different versions of the SoC.

3. The patch updates the driver name from "hix5hd2-gmac" to "hisi-gemac", which reflects the generic nature of the driver.

4. The patch adds definitions for hardware capabilities and differentiates between "GEMAC_V1" and "GEMAC_V2" versions.

5. The patch updates the device table to include the new compatible strings and assigns the appropriate version data.

6. The patch updates the module description to reflect the generic nature of the Gigabit Ethernet MAC driver.

Overall, the patch improves compatibility, clarity, and maintainability of the ethernet driver for the "hix5hd2" SoC. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters in the cxgb4 driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality related to the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics in the amdgpu driver. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: Reorder i915_params fields to not create holes." This suggests that it aims to reorder the fields in the i915_params structure to avoid creating any holes.

2. Looking at the patch, we can see that it reorders the fields in the i915_params structure. Specifically, it moves the "enable_hangcheck" and "fastboot" fields to the end of the structure, after the "invert_brightness" field.

3. The patch also adds a comment stating that bools are left at the end to avoid creating holes.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code cleanup or optimization change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing an error path in the mcb_pci_probe() function where it incorrectly returns zero instead of an error code. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch adds missing OUT register settings for SRC_BUSIF_MODE in the rsnd_gen2_probe() function and updates the corresponding enum and register definitions.

While this patch may improve the code's completeness and correctness, it does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the IS_ERR_OR_NULL macro instead of explicitly checking for NULL and IS_ERR separately. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the nfsd (NFS server) code in the Linux kernel. It introduces reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op and makes some modifications to the nfsd4_open_downgrade and nfsd4_lock functions.

Based on the provided patch, it is not immediately clear whether it fixes a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). The patch seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch includes a "FIXME" comment, which suggests that there might be some unfinished work or unresolved issues related to the changes made.

Considering these factors, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further information or context is provided to demonstrate its criticality and necessity for fixing a real and significant issue.
false || This patch is a whitespace cleanup and symbol visibility change in the `drivers/crypto/dcp.c` file. It makes the `global_dev` symbol static and changes the visibility of two functions, `dcp_dma_unmap` and `dcp_watchdog`, to static as well.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only contains trivial fixes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a local variable 'status' and simplifies the code by removing an unnecessary check.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that adds the "const" qualifier to the "data" parameter in the fsnotify() function and its related declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is fixing a bug related to the blackfin architecture's clock driver. It specifically addresses the issue of clk_round_rate() returning a negative error code instead of 0 upon an error.

2. The rationale for the change is explained in the patch description. The return type of clk_round_rate() is being changed to an unsigned type to accommodate clock sources that can generate rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.

3. The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The actual code change is straightforward and does not involve any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The bug being fixed does not fall into the category of build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it does address an issue that could potentially cause incorrect behavior or unexpected results, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a non-trivial issue, and it does not introduce any unnecessary changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects some kerneldoc typos and adjusts the function declaration for consistency. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains trivial fixes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces open-coded spi_sync() with spi_sync_transfer(). This change makes the code slightly shorter but does not fix any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The change replaces the variable `mute_led_nid` with `cap_mute_led_nid` in the `alc269_fixup_hp_cap_mic_mute_hook` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that turns off the voltage for thermistors when the ADC conversion is initiated. This change is aimed at saving power.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the MPL3115 pressure sensor driver in the IIO subsystem. The patch adds the use of claim/release helper functions to ensure that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, it fixes a bug related to the driver not properly locking direct mode during raw reads.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description, but based on the context, it seems to be a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect readings from the MPL3115 pressure sensor. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, or data corruption, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the bug at hand.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect readings from the MPL3115 pressure sensor.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup of error codes in the hv.c file in the staging directory. The patch changes the return values from -1 to specific error codes, such as -EMSGSIZE and -ENOMEM.

Since this patch only involves error code cleanup and does not fix any real and critical bugs, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue of dropped characters at close in the sierra USB serial driver. The patch adds the implementation of the `sierra_chars_in_buffer` function, which calculates the number of characters in the buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBS (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue of dropped characters, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the visibility of a structure declaration. The change from "struct snd_soc_aux_dev rx51_aux_dev[]" to "static struct snd_soc_aux_dev rx51_aux_dev[]" suggests that the intention is to limit the visibility of the "rx51_aux_dev" structure to the current file.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

2. It introduces a new macro `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the number of intervals.

3. The `INTERVALS` macro is defined as `(1UL << INTERVAL_SHIFT)`, which calculates the number of intervals based on the shift value.

4. In the `get_typical_interval` function, the patch checks if the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`. If true, it performs a right shift of `avg` and `stddev` by `INTERVAL_SHIFT` bits instead of using `do_div`.

5. The patch then calculates the standard deviation by summing the squared differences between the intervals and the average interval.

6. Finally, the patch checks if the standard deviation is small compared to the average interval to determine the typical interval.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It improves the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor and introduces a more efficient way of calculating intervals using shifts instead of `do_div` when the divisor is a power of two. This change does not fall under the category of "trivial" fixes and can potentially address real and critical bugs or issues related to the cpuidle menu governor.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue in the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the uprobes/x86 code.

2. The current code assumes that the ->pre_xol() hook cannot fail, but it is necessary to fix the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function regardless.

3. The patch adds a check for the presence of the ->pre_xol() hook and calls it if it exists.

4. If the ->pre_xol() hook returns an error, the patch ensures that the task's state is not changed and the error is returned to allow for a restart.

5. After the ->pre_xol() hook is called (if it exists), the patch sets the instruction pointer (ip) to the xol_vaddr of the uprobe_task.

6. The patch also updates the trap_nr and blockstep flags for the current task.

7. Finally, the patch removes the redundant call to ->pre_xol() after setting the blockstep flag.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to the handling of the ->pre_xol() hook and ensures that the task's state is not changed if the hook fails. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver. Instead, it suggests determining the value of 'ai_continuous' from the cmd->stop_src member.

Looking at the code changes, it seems that the 'ai_continuous' member is no longer being used or referenced anywhere in the driver. The patch also introduces a new variable 'cmd' to access the comedi_cmd structure.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the removal of 'ai_continuous' does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the removal of 'ai_continuous' can be considered a trivial fix as it does not impact the functionality or stability of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the libcfs_ioctl() prototype in the staging/lustre code. The patch changes the second argument of the libcfs_ioctl() function from "void *arg" to "void __user *arg". 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch appears to fix a prototype mismatch in the libcfs_ioctl() function. While this may not be a critical bug, it is a bug that could potentially cause issues if the incorrect argument type is used. 

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   - The patch does not seem to address any of these issues directly. It is more of a correctness fix rather than a fix for a critical issue.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)? 
   - The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on correcting the prototype of the libcfs_ioctl() function.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a correctness fix rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. It only introduces a local variable `ops` to store `rdev->desc->ops` and uses it in subsequent code blocks. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the powergating logic in the AMDGPU driver for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU family. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code." This suggests that it is refining the power management code for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block on CI GPUs.

2. The patch includes a "Fix up the powergating logic" comment, indicating that there was an issue with the powergating logic that needed to be addressed.

3. The patch is signed-off by Rex Zhu and has an Ack-by from Tom St Denis, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch also has a Reviewed-by tag from Alex Deucher, further indicating that it has been reviewed by another developer.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` function in the `ci_dpm.c` file.

6. The changes in the function include adding powergating state control for the UVD block based on the `gate` parameter. If `gate` is true, the UVD block is stopped and powergated. If `gate` is false, the UVD block is un-gated.

7. The `ci_update_uvd_dpm` function is called after the powergating state is set, regardless of whether it is gated or un-gated.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is fixing a real issue with the powergating logic for the UVD block on CI GPUs. It is not a trivial fix as it involves modifying the powergating state and ensuring the UVD block is properly stopped or un-gated. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a function in the rtl8192e driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function "add_pcie_port" to "dra7xx_add_pcie_port" in the PCI driver for the dra7xx platform. This change is made to avoid name collision in the global namespace.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new feature to the DRM Radeon driver for the Cayman GPU. The patch implements the ability to force a performance level via sysfs. 

Since this patch is adding a new feature rather than fixing a bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for encoding the `flags` field in the `ceph_osd_op` structure. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the bug description, severity, and impact. This information is crucial in determining whether the bug is critical, causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant problems that warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds the necessary Kconfig entry to enable the MODULE_TX28 configuration option. This option selects various platform-specific features, including MXS_HAVE_PLATFORM_MXS_MMC. This indicates that the patch is adding support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform.

2. The patch also adds a struct mxs_mmc_platform_data variable named tx28_mmc0_pdata. This structure contains platform-specific data for the MXS MMC device, such as the write-protect GPIO pin and the supported capabilities. In this case, the write-protect GPIO pin is set to -EINVAL, indicating that it is not used, and the device is marked as 4-bit capable.

3. The patch modifies the tx28_stk5v3_init function to call mx28_add_mxs_mmc with the index 0 and the tx28_mmc0_pdata structure. This function call adds the MXS MMC device to the platform and initializes it with the provided platform data.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding necessary support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. It does not appear to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch can be considered as "trivial" fixes since they are adding support for a new device and do not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the MIPS PNX8550 platform. The warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization data annotation in the prom_getcmdline() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It addresses a section mismatch warning, which is not considered a critical issue.

Additionally, the patch contains a trivial fix by adding the __init annotation to the prom_getcmdline() function. While this is a necessary fix, it falls under the category of a "trivial" change, as it only involves adding an annotation.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: "Staging: hv: Properly handle the error in hv_acpi_init()"
   The title suggests that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - K. Y. Srinivasan <kys@microsoft.com>
   - Haiyang Zhang <haiyangz@microsoft.com>
   - Hank Janssen <hjanssen@microsoft.com>
   - Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

   These lines indicate the authors and contributors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the hv_acpi_init() function in the vmbus_drv.c file.

   - Line 788: The patch adds error handling code after calling vmbus_bus_init(irq).
     If vmbus_bus_init() returns a non-zero value (indicating an error), the patch unregisters the vmbus_acpi_driver using acpi_bus_unregister_driver() and returns the error code.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function. It properly handles the error by unregistering the vmbus_acpi_driver if vmbus_bus_init() fails.

   Since this patch fixes a real bug and improves error handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file of the hwmon subsystem. The patch modifies some macros for consistency and to improve code readability.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a vifs list to the wl12xx driver in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds a new list and initializes it.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the clock data for OMAP4. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any significant functionality or performance improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, such trivial fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a critical bug related to interface enumeration failure in the greybus driver. The patch deactivates the interface immediately upon enumeration failure and handles the error cases appropriately.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the usage of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function of the `ux500_pcm.c` file. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `spin_lock_init()` function call after the error checking for the `kmalloc()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the stability or security of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of pr_err/info functions with dev_err/info functions in the cpufreq driver for Exynos processors. This change aims to provide more accurate log messages with the device name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the function `clk_get()` to `devm_clk_get()` in the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function. This change suggests that the patch is replacing the usage of `clk_get()` with the managed version `devm_clk_get()`. This change is not a trivial fix as it affects the clock handling in the code.

2. The patch removes the `clk_put()` call in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the `clk_put()` call is no longer necessary or has been handled differently. Removing this call could potentially introduce a resource leak if not handled correctly.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code improvement or optimization. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. The reason for marking them as static is that they are not used outside of this file. This improves code organization and reduces the risk of accidental usage or conflicts with other functions.

Additionally, the patch addresses a warning in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file by providing prototypes for the `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` functions. This ensures that the functions are properly declared before they are used, eliminating the warning.

Since the patch fixes a real issue (the warning) and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the start of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This is a valid improvement as it ensures that the interrupt mode is checked before proceeding with any further validations.

2. The patch also adds a check to skip ring count validation if the ring counts are not going to change. This optimization can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary validations.

3. The patch includes a check for `QLCNIC_MSIX_ENABLED` flag to ensure that RSS/TSS support is available in MSI-X mode. If the flag is not set, it returns an error with an appropriate error message. This check ensures that the required support is available before proceeding with the ring count validation.

4. The patch checks if `channel->other_count` or `channel->combined_count` is non-zero and returns an error. This check ensures that these counts are not modified, which is a valid requirement.

5. The patch checks if `adapter->drv_sds_rings` is not equal to `channel->rx_count` and performs ring count validation for RX queues if necessary. This check ensures that the RX ring count is validated only when it is going to change.

6. Similarly, the patch checks if `adapter->drv_tx_rings` is not equal to `channel->tx_count` and performs ring count validation for TX queues if necessary. This check ensures that the TX ring count is validated only when it is going to change.

7. The patch removes some ring count validation checks from `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function, which are no longer necessary due to the previous optimizations. This cleanup is acceptable as it removes redundant code.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to optimize ring count validations and adds necessary checks for interrupt mode and ring count changes. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to RSS/TSS support. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue), and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the bcm_sf2 driver in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) subsystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch description:
   The patch description explains that during the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use b53_common, a small piece was left untouched where a local copy of the per-port port_vlan_ctl bitmask value was kept. The patch aims to fix this issue by using the value maintained by b53_device instead of the local copy.

2. Fixes tag:
   The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit hash "f458995b9ad8" that introduced the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use the core B53 driver. This indicates that the patch is intended to address a specific issue introduced by that commit.

3. Signed-off-by:
   The patch includes the "Signed-off-by" lines from Florian Fainelli and David S. Miller, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the bcm_sf2_port_setup function in the bcm_sf2.c file. Specifically, it replaces the usage of "priv->port_sts[port].vlan_ctl_mask" with "priv->dev->ports[port].vlan_ctl_mask" in the "reg |= ..." line. This change ensures that the correct vlan_ctl_mask value is used.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the bcm_sf2 driver and fixes an incorrect usage of the vlan_ctl_mask value. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug or whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make a final decision, it would be necessary to consider additional factors such as the impact of the bug, the stability of the patch, and the potential risks associated with applying it to stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "mtd: docg3: Don't leak docg3->bbt in error path" and is signed-off by Richard Weinberger and Brian Norris.

2. In the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the error handling path in the `doc_probe_device` function in the `docg3.c` file.

3. The patch changes the `goto nomem3` statement to `goto nomem4` in two places. This means that if the `chip_id` is not equal to its inverse, it will jump to the `nomem4` label instead of `nomem3`.

4. The `nomem4` label is added and it frees the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt` using `kfree`.

5. The `nomem3` label is already present in the code and it frees the memory allocated for `mtd` using `kfree`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential memory leak issue by properly freeing the allocated memory for `docg3->bbt` in the error path. This is not a trivial fix as it addresses a resource management issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p_jpeg_device_run and s5p_jpeg_runtime_resume callbacks. These callbacks alter device registers, which makes it critical to have spin_lock protection.

The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to protect the critical sections of code. This ensures that the device registers are accessed safely in a multi-threaded or interrupt-driven environment.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces "x != NULL" with "x". This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the missing OF module alias information for the ppc4xx_edac platform driver. This fix enables module autoloading for the driver.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix SGL Initialization and posting Pages for Dual Chute". It mentions that the initialization of SGL (Scatter-Gather List) and related page posting is to be done for the chute based on the configuration value of each chute. It also states that for the BE-X family, the iSCSI protocol is loaded only on a single chute.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by John Soni Jose, Jayamohan Kallickal, and James Bottomley.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the file "drivers/scsi/be2iscsi/be_main.c" and makes the following changes:

   - Line 3450: A loop is added to iterate over the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers. If a ULP is supported, the loop breaks.
   - Line 3453: The variable "page_offset" is calculated based on the ULP number.
   - Line 3946: The loop for initializing the SGL handle is modified to calculate the ULP's ICD (Initial Connection Descriptor) start value based on the ULP number.
   - Line 4013: The loop for initializing the SGL handle is modified to calculate the ULP's ICD start value and store it in the variable "ulp_icd_start".
   - Line 4031: The loop for initializing the SGL handle is modified to use the "ulp_icd_start" value instead of the ULP number.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. The patch seems to be addressing an issue related to SGL initialization and page posting for the dual chute configuration in the be2iscsi driver. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.

Therefore, I cannot determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) based on the provided information.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: nau8825: jack connection decision with different insertion logic." This suggests that it aims to address an issue related to jack connection decision in the nau8825 ASoC codec driver.

2. The patch includes changes to the function `nau8825_is_jack_inserted()`, which is responsible for determining whether a jack is inserted or not.

3. The patch introduces two new variables, `active_high` and `is_high`, and initializes them accordingly.

4. The patch reads the value of the `NAU8825_REG_JACK_DET_CTRL` register and checks the `NAU8825_JACK_POLARITY` bit to determine if the jack insertion logic is active high or active low.

5. The patch reads the value of the `NAU8825_REG_I2C_DEVICE_ID` register and checks the `NAU8825_GPIO2JD1` bit to determine the current jack insertion status.

6. The patch then compares the `active_high` variable with the `is_high` variable to determine the jack connection status based on the jack insertion logic.

7. Finally, the patch returns the jack connection status according to the jack insertion logic.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to jack connection decision in the nau8825 ASoC codec driver. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be more of a "trivial" fix rather than a significant improvement or critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the regulator_ops structure to use the regulator_map_voltage_ascend function instead of the regulator_list_voltage_table function.

Since this change does not fix any critical issue and is considered a trivial fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new member called "allow_runtime_pm" of type bool to the "struct sdhci_pci_fixes" and "struct sdhci_pci_chip" structures. This flag indicates whether runtime PM is allowed for the device.

2. In the "sdhci_intel_mfd_sd", "sdhci_intel_mfd_sdio", and "sdhci_intel_mfd_emmc" structures, the "allow_runtime_pm" flag is set to true. This means that runtime PM is allowed for these specific devices.

3. In the "sdhci_pci_probe" function, the "allow_runtime_pm" flag is checked before calling "sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow". This ensures that runtime PM is only allowed if the flag is set to true for the device.

4. In the "sdhci_pci_remove" function, the "allow_runtime_pm" flag is checked before calling "sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid". This ensures that runtime PM is only forbidden if the flag is set to true for the device.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch adds support for runtime PM for specific devices in the sdhci-pci driver. Since it does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. It adds support for handling interrupts for both VCS1 and VCS2 rings. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to handling interrupts for the second BSD ring. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or any other critical issues. We would also need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without this additional information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch fixes an uninitialized return variable in the function `request_code_segment()` in the `ft1000_download.c` file of the `ft1000` staging driver. The return variable is used uninitialized when the `boot_case` argument is false.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the code at line 604, replacing the function `write_blk_fifo()` with `status = write_blk_fifo()`. Additionally, it modifies the code at line 607, replacing `ft1000_write_dpram16()` with `status |= ft1000_write_dpram16()`.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses an issue where the return variable `status` is used uninitialized when `boot_case` is false. By assigning the return value of `write_blk_fifo()` to `status`, the variable is properly initialized. Similarly, by using `status |= ft1000_write_dpram16()`, the value of `status` is preserved when `ft1000_write_dpram16()` is called.

4. Impact:
   This patch fixes a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results when `request_code_segment()` is called with `boot_case` set to false. It does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that could potentially cause issues and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the clock ID for the "pclk_isp_in" clock in the Rockchip RK3288 clock driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "blk-mq-sched: check for successful allocation before assigning tag". This suggests that it addresses a potential issue related to the allocation of tags in the blk-mq-sched (block multi-queue scheduler) subsystem.

2. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Bart Van Assche from SanDisk.

3. The patch modifies the function `blk_mq_sched_get_request` in the file `block/blk-mq-sched.c`.

4. In the original code, a request (`rq`) is allocated using the `__blk_mq_alloc_request` function. In the else block, the `rq` is assigned to `data->hctx->tags->rqs[rq->tag]` without checking if the allocation was successful.

5. The patch adds a check `if (rq)` before assigning `rq` to `data->hctx->tags->rqs[rq->tag]`. This ensures that the assignment only occurs if the allocation was successful.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue in the blk-mq-sched subsystem by adding a necessary check for successful allocation before assigning the tag. Although the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs or security issues, it appears to fix a potential problem that could lead to data corruption or other issues in certain scenarios.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the naming for the "micd-timeout" device tree property in the extcon-arizona driver. It adds the time units of -ms (milliseconds) to the property.

2. The patch is signed-off by Charles Keepax and Chanwoo Choi.

3. In the extcon-arizona.txt documentation file, the "micd-timeout" property is changed to "micd-timeout-ms" to reflect the updated naming.

4. In the extcon-arizona.c driver file, the "micd-timeout" property is read using the new name "micd-timeout-ms" and the value is assigned to the "micd_timeout" variable.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Instead, it seems to be a trivial fix related to naming and units.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "ASoC: delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time so the hardware could get time to initialize and debounce."

2. Signed-off-by: xiangxiao <xiaoxiang@xiaomi.com>
   Signed-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@linaro.org>, sound/soc/soc-jack.c

3. Code changes:
   - Line 342: The initial jack status update is modified.
     - The previous code called `snd_soc_jack_gpio_detect(&gpios[i])` to detect the initial jack status.
     - The modified code schedules a delayed work using `schedule_delayed_work()` with a delay of `gpios[i].debounce_time` milliseconds.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to introduce a delay in the initial jack detection process to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. This delay is achieved by scheduling a delayed work.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided patch description, it seems that this patch addresses a potential issue related to the initial jack detection process.

Given that the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.), and assuming that the delay introduced by the patch is necessary to ensure proper hardware initialization and debounce, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that a more thorough analysis and understanding of the specific bug being fixed would be required to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a redundant definition for `pgprot_writecombine`. This patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that hardcodes the clock event rating to 125 for the CMT driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or necessary changes.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `snd_array_new` in the file `sound/pci/hda/hda_codec.c`. The purpose of this function is to allocate memory for an array used in the ALSA HDA (High Definition Audio) driver.

The patch replaces the explicit `memset` call with the `__GFP_ZERO` flag in the `krealloc` function. This flag ensures that the newly allocated memory is zero-initialized, effectively achieving the same result as the original `memset` call.

The change improves code readability and reduces redundancy by eliminating the explicit `memset` call. It also ensures that the allocated memory is properly initialized, which is important for avoiding potential issues related to uninitialized memory.

Although this change can be considered a "trivial" fix in terms of code functionality, it does not fall into the category of spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue related to uninitialized memory, which can lead to bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a potential issue and does not introduce any regressions, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to microcode handling for AMD processors. The patch reads the CPUID(1).EAX leaf at the correct CPU and uses it to search for a matching microcode patch in an equivalence table. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to missing return statements in the nl802154_add_llsec_key() function. The patch adds a missing return statement to handle the case where certain attributes are not present, returning -EINVAL.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or security issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used in the msi-available-ranges property. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the system. Therefore, this patch addresses a real and critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the bug at hand.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the platform name from "omap-pcm-audio" to "omap-mcbsp.2" in the n810_dai structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming of the platform name.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8994: Make sure we sync DAPM on WM8958 detection mode changes." It appears to address a specific issue related to the WM8958 audio codec driver in the ASoC subsystem.

The patch modifies the `wm8958_mic_detect` function in the `wm8994.c` file. It adds two lines of code to force enable or disable a pin (`CLK_SYS`) in the DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) context and then syncs the DAPM context.

Based on the provided patch and description, it seems that this change ensures that the DAPM context is properly synchronized when the detection mode changes for the WM8958 codec. This synchronization is necessary when the system enables or disables detection at runtime.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a sparse warning. The warning itself does not indicate a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the fix does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing call to `i2c_set_clientdata()` in the `mma8450_probe()` function. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is to modify the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq` from `unsigned int` to `int`. The reason for this change is that the function may eventually return a negative error code.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix related to the return type of a function.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming two repository routines in the powerpc/ps3 code. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the error-handling code of `nes_reg_user_mr()` function in `nes_verbs.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch removes two lines of code that set the current x and y counts to zero. Since there is no explanation or justification provided for this change, it does not seem to fix any specific issue or address any critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the Intel(R) Trace Hub PCI ID for Broxton SOC. This does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "usb_put_dev". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

Given that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary code), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a parenthesis. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary calls to usb_get_dev and usb_put_dev functions.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused constant, OZ_MAX_TIMER_POOL_SIZE. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the email address of the author in the MODULE_AUTHOR field. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate "const" declaration in the ASoC wm8804 driver. This fix addresses a sparse warning related to the duplicate const declaration.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized variable issue in the netpoll_setup function in net/core/netpoll.c. The issue was reported by Fengguang Wu and the patch is signed-off by Cong Wang and David S. Miller.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses a warning about an uninitialized variable.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve moving the allocation of a local variable and removing an unnecessary if statement. These changes do not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the contrast value in the wm8505 framebuffer driver. The original commit had a typo in the contrast value, and this patch corrects it to a more suitable value based on user feedback.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check to only disable the 1.2GHz OPP (Operating Performance Point) for the mx6quad variant.
2. The purpose of this check is to avoid a warning message that occurs on the mx6solo variant when trying to disable the 1.2GHz OPP.
3. The patch is signed-off by Fabio Estevam and Shawn Guo, who are both from Freescale.
4. The patch modifies the file "arch/arm/mach-imx/mach-imx6q.c" at line 320.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the mx6solo variant and avoids a warning message. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that clears the hidden CPU state at reset time. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of always reporting that the interrupt was handled, even when there was nothing to do. By introducing a boolean variable "handled" and setting it to true when there is actual work done, the patch ensures that IRQ_NONE is reported when there is nothing to handle.

This change allows for recovery from stuck-IRQ problems, preventing the kernel from locking up. It improves the overall stability and reliability of the system.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause system lockups.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only converts the code to use the new irq_alloc/free_hwirq interface without any functional change. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch converts the i2c core to use the common attach/detach functions for PM domains, extending the support to include the generic PM domain as well. This indicates a change in functionality and potentially addresses a bug or limitation in the previous implementation.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by multiple developers.

3. The changes made in the patch involve modifying the i2c_device_probe() and i2c_device_remove() functions in the i2c-core.c file.

4. In the i2c_device_probe() function, the patch replaces the usage of acpi_dev_pm_attach() and acpi_dev_pm_detach() with dev_pm_domain_attach() and dev_pm_domain_detach() functions. This change suggests a shift from supporting only ACPI PM domain to supporting the generic PM domain as well.

5. The patch also includes a check for -EPROBE_DEFER when calling dev_pm_domain_attach(). If the return value is -EPROBE_DEFER, the probe is deferred, and the detach function is not called.

6. In the i2c_device_remove() function, the patch replaces acpi_dev_pm_detach() with dev_pm_domain_detach().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch introduces a functional change to the i2c core, extending the support for PM domains. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues explicitly mentioned as criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address any critical issues. As per the given criteria, patches with trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture. It checks if the weak symbol `vpe_run()` is defined or not. If it is not defined (i.e., its value is zero), the patch returns failure early without attempting to load the VPE (Virtual Processing Element).

The patch also includes a warning message when `vpe_run()` is not defined, indicating that the ELF load has failed. This provides useful information for debugging purposes.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like build errors or data corruption.

Therefore, considering the nature of the patch and its adherence to the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend accepting it (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "usb: dwc2: host: add function to compare frame index"
   - The patch appears to add a new function to compare frame indexes in the dwc2 USB host driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - The function `dwc2_frame_idx_num_gt` is added to compare frame indexes used for descriptor lists with 64 entries.
   - The function performs a modulo comparison of frame indexes, accounting for rollover when the maximum index is reached.
   - The function returns true if `fr_idx1` is greater than `fr_idx2`.

3. Acked-by: John Youn <johnyoun@synopsys.com>
   - The patch has been reviewed and approved by John Youn.

4. Signed-off-by: Gregory Herrero <gregory.herrero@intel.com>
   - The patch has been signed off by Gregory Herrero.

5. Signed-off-by: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>, drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.h
   - The patch has been signed off by Felipe Balbi and is related to the `drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.h` file.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch adds a necessary function to compare frame indexes in the dwc2 USB host driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially address a critical bug or issue related to frame index comparison.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a deprecated and unused operation related to video-level DV timings in the s5p-tv driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for an indentation style issue in the ks7010_sdio.c file. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the dma-range size when the DT attribute is missing. It sets the size to dev->coherent_dma_mask + 1 instead of dev->coherent_dma_mask and adds code to check for invalid values of size configured in DT and log an error.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake RAPL in the powercap intel_rapl driver. Gemini Lake RAPL support is stated to be similar to Goldmont.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

From the information provided, it seems that this patch does not address any specific bug or issue. Instead, it adds support for a new hardware platform (Gemini Lake) in the powercap intel_rapl driver. This can be considered an enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug.

Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and splitting of the FPU initialization sequence into two parts: one for system initialization and one for per-CPU initialization. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `dev_{get|set}_drvdata` with `spi_{get|set}_drvdata` in the `mrf24j40` driver. This change allows for direct passing of the `struct spi_device` instead of using `&spi->dev`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a NULL comparison style in the code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the MODULE_VERSION macro from the carl9170 driver in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of a cleanup or cosmetic change.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` to the `vce_v3_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function is responsible for setting the bypass mode for VCE 3.0.

2. The `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function reads the current value of the `GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `RREG32_SMC` and stores it in the `tmp` variable.

3. If the `enable` parameter is true, the function sets the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit in the `tmp` variable using a bitwise OR operation. Otherwise, it clears the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit using a bitwise AND operation.

4. Finally, the function writes the modified value of the `tmp` variable back to the `GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `WREG32_SMC`.

5. The `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function in the same file checks if the `adev->asic_type` is `CHIP_POLARIS10`. If it is, it calls the `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function with the `enable` parameter based on the `state` parameter.

6. The patch also includes a check for `AMD_CG_SUPPORT_VCE_MGCG` in the `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function. If this flag is not set, the function returns 0.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a new function and modifies an existing function to support bypass mode for VCE 3.0 on the Polaris10 chip. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to initializing the "tokens" and "ctokens" variables correctly in the htb_change_class function in the sch_htb.c file. The patch converts the values from ticks to nanoseconds using the PSCHED_TICKS2NS macro.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses an issue with incorrect initialization of variables, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or performance problems. While it may not be a critical bug, it can be considered a bug that needs fixing.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not seem to address any of these issues directly. It is more focused on correctness and performance.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to variable initialization.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. However, the final decision ultimately rests with the maintainers and reviewers of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: [SCSI] pm80xx: Fix for 32 bit compilation warning
   This patch aims to fix a compilation warning related to 32-bit systems in the pm80xx SCSI driver.

2. Signed-off-by: Anandkumar.Santhanam@pmcs.com
   The patch is signed off by Anandkumar.Santhanam@pmcs.com, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

3. Signed-off-by: James Bottomley <JBottomley@Parallels.com>, drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_init.c
   The patch is also signed off by James Bottomley, who is associated with Parallels.com and is the maintainer of the SCSI subsystem.

4. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the pm8001_ioremap() function in the pm8001_init.c file.

   - Line 424: A type casting change is made to the memvirtaddr field.
     Before the patch:
     (u64)pm8001_ha->io_mem[logicalBar].memvirtaddr

     After the patch:
     (u64)(unsigned long)pm8001_ha->io_mem[logicalBar].memvirtaddr

   The change casts the memvirtaddr field to an unsigned long before assigning it to the u64 variable. This change is made to address a compilation warning related to 32-bit systems.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a compilation warning on 32-bit systems. It does not fix a critical bug, cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference error in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds a NULL check for the 'match' variable before using it. 

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch converts the control and DAPM initialization in the ASoC wm8940 codec driver to a table-based approach. It replaces the existing audio_map with wm8940_dapm_routes and wm8940_dapm_widgets.

Looking at the changes, it seems that the patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup, converting the control and DAPM initialization to a more structured table-based approach.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and contains only a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "drm_framebuffer_funcs" argument in two functions: "drm_fb_cma_alloc()" and "drm_fbdev_cma_create_with_funcs()". 

Since this patch only adds the "const" qualifier to function arguments, it does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve existing functionality.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add the ability to defer skb freeing in the net_sched module. This change aims to address issues related to TX/RX freezes and latency spikes caused by freeing skbs under locks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, it aims to fix TX/RX freezes and latency spikes caused by freeing skbs under locks.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: Yes, the bug causes TX/RX freezes and latency spikes, which can significantly impact system performance.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a new function, rtnl_kfree_skbs(), and modifies existing functions to utilize it.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to properly starting and stopping the phy device in the mv643xx_eth driver. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as oops, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, it addresses a real and critical issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on the bug fix.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only replaces a couple of lines of code with a helper function, which calculates a multiplier value from wMaxPacketSize. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for cleaning up coding style issues in the clk-bcm2835.c file. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a code style warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only replaces the usage of `call->conn->params.peer` with `call->peer` in multiple places. This change is not related to fixing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a macro from "RSND_GEN2_SRU" to "RSND_GEN2_SCU". This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity or consistency purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the file `fs/proc/kcore.c` and specifically focuses on the `elf_kcore_store_hdr` function. The change is as follows:

```diff
-	strncpy(prpsinfo.pr_psargs, saved_command_line, ELF_PRARGSZ);
+	strlcpy(prpsinfo.pr_psargs, saved_command_line, sizeof(prpsinfo.pr_psargs));
```

The patch replaces the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy` to copy the `saved_command_line` string into `prpsinfo.pr_psargs`. The `strlcpy` function ensures that the destination string is always null-terminated, even if the source string is longer than the destination buffer.

Now, let's evaluate whether this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - No, this patch does not fix a bug. It is a code improvement to ensure proper null termination.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   - No, this patch does not introduce any build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

3. Does it fix a real security issue?
   - No, this patch does not fix a security issue. It is a code improvement.

4. Does it address an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - No, this patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a code improvement.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)?
   - No, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a struct and associated variable names. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: staging: comedi: ni_atmio16d: use comedi_buf_write_samples()
   - The patch title suggests that the patch is related to the staging driver for the National Instruments ATMIO16D device in the Comedi subsystem.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch aims to improve the aesthetics of the code by using the comedi_buf_write_samples() function to add a sample to the async buffer.

3. Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off-by H Hartley Sweeten and reviewed-by Ian Abbott, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change replaces the line `comedi_buf_put(s, inw(dev->iobase + AD_FIFO_REG));` with two new lines of code.
   - The first new line `val = inw(dev->iobase + AD_FIFO_REG);` reads a value from the device's input register.
   - The second new line `comedi_buf_write_samples(s, &val, 1);` writes the value to the async buffer using the comedi_buf_write_samples() function.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a trivial change that improves code aesthetics by using a different function to add a sample to the async buffer. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to selecting only devices with active links in the staging/rdma/hfi1 driver. The patch introduces a new function `usable_device` that checks if a device is available for general use by verifying if the driver link state is active. The patch then modifies the `get_user_context` function to only consider devices that are active when assigning a user context.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical issue related to device availability and ensures that only active devices are used, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch exports the function `ioremap_nocache` in the CRIS architecture. The function `ioremap_nocache` is used to map physical addresses to virtual addresses for memory-mapped I/O operations. 

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial change that exports a function. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style issue flagged by checkpatch.pl. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "staging: rtl8712: Remove unnecessary cast on void pointer"
   - This indicates that the patch aims to remove an unnecessary cast on a void pointer.

2. Coccinelle script:
   - The Coccinelle script is used to detect instances of unnecessary casts in the code.

3. Patch changes:
   - The patch modifies the code in the file "drivers/staging/rtl8712/usb_ops_linux.c" at line 334.
   - It replaces the cast on the "priv" variable from "(struct _adapter *)" to just "priv".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is removing an unnecessary cast on the "priv" variable. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing an unnecessary cast), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that makes the function `lp8727_ctrl_switch()` inline. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that clarifies variable names and prepares for further checks. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to releasing the rtnl_lock on error paths in the enic_change_mtu_work() function in the enic_main.c file of the enic driver. 

The patch adds rtnl_unlock() calls before returning on two error paths. This ensures that the rtnl_lock is released properly in case of errors during the execution of the function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug by properly releasing the rtnl_lock, it can be considered a valid fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it ensures two channels are clocked for I2S mode, as I2S requires stereo clocking even for mono data.

2. The patch modifies the `arizona_hw_params` function in the `arizona.c` file.

3. The patch introduces a new variable `val` to store the value read from the ARIZONA_AIF_FORMAT register.

4. The patch checks if the number of channels in the `params` structure is 1 and if the ARIZONA_AIF1_FMT_MASK bit is set in `val`. If both conditions are true, it means that mono data is being used in I2S mode.

5. In this case, the patch prints a debug message and doubles the `bclk_target` value, effectively ensuring stereo clocking for mono data in I2S mode.

6. Finally, the patch continues with the existing logic to select the appropriate bclk rate.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential issue where mono data in I2S mode may not be correctly clocked. This could lead to audio playback issues or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug. The patch mainly focuses on caching the current cdclk frequency in dev_priv and updating the cdclk frequency in various functions. Since the patch does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the enable/disable functions for the SMFC module from ipu-common.c to ipu-smfc.c. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/radeon: set power control in ci dpm enable" and is signed-off by Alex Deucher <alexander.deucher@amd.com>. This indicates that it is intended to address a specific issue related to power control in the Radeon driver.

2. The patch adds a call to the function "ci_power_control_set_level(rdev)" in the "ci_dpm_enable" function. This suggests that the patch is introducing a new power control mechanism for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU series.

3. The patch checks the return value of "ci_power_control_set_level(rdev)" and returns an error if it fails. This indicates that the patch is handling potential failure scenarios.

4. The patch also enables auto-throttling based on thermal conditions and updates the current power state.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new power control mechanism for the CI GPU series and handling potential failure scenarios. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch seems to be more of an enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to fix a detection issue for some boards in the BCM47XX MIPS architecture. It addresses a problem where the nvram reset performed from CFE sometimes does not contain the productid value in nvram but still contains the hardware_version.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it adds specific board types and their corresponding hardware versions to the bcm47xx_board_list_hardware_version array. These additions seem to be necessary to correctly identify and handle the affected boards.

Based on the provided information, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a specific board detection fix.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to export the I2C table for the lirc_zilog driver. This change allows udev to auto load the correct module when the device is added.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it changes the visibility of the function `register_disk()` from global to static. This means that the function can only be accessed within the same source file, `block/genhd.c`. 

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a sparse warning by making the function `digital_tg_send_sensf_res()` static.

It is a trivial fix that only affects the visibility of the function within the file.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a debug entry for GCA configuration data in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes changes to the amdgpu_device.c file, adding a new debugfs file operation for reading the GCA configuration data.

Analyzing the patch against the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, we can determine the following:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? No, the patch does not fix a bug. It adds a new debug entry for GCA configuration data.

2. Does the patch cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the em28xx-v4l extension in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch moves the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() from the em28xx_v4l2_close() function to the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function.

3. The reason for this change is to ensure that these functions are called whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

4. The patch also updates the warning message in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function to reflect that memory deallocation is deferred on the last close, rather than deregistration.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the em28xx-v4l extension and ensures that necessary functions are called when the extension is closed. Additionally, it improves the warning message to provide clearer information to users.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to auxtrace data alignment in the perf tools. The patch allows the auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size, which is necessary for certain scenarios like BTS where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing trace statement in the ext4_ext_map_blocks() function. This trace statement is meant to trace blocks punched out when the function is called by punch_hole.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue. The patch allows X.509 certificates to be blacklisted based on their TBSCertificate hash. While this feature may be convenient and align with UEFI's blacklist, it does not address any of the specified criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the deletion of the AP station in the iwlwifi driver. The patch ensures that the station is not deleted directly, but instead marked as unused and relies on the unassociated RXON to drop it from the station database in the device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific behavior in the iwlwifi driver, which may not fall under the critical bug category.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding accessor functions for the GCR_L2_CONFIG register in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds register accessors.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch is titled "[SCSI] qla2xxx: No fcport FC-4 type assignment in GA_NXT response." This suggests that the patch aims to fix an issue related to the FC-4 type assignment in the qla2xxx SCSI driver.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by three individuals, Armen Baloyan, Saurav Kashyap, and James Bottomley. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and approval by these contributors.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the qla2x00_ga_nxt() function in the qla_gs.c file. Specifically, it adds the assignment of the fc4_type for the fcport based on the fc4_types array in the ct_rsp structure.

4. Impact analysis: The patch addresses the issue of missing fcport FC-4 type assignment in the GA_NXT response. This suggests that without this fix, there might be incorrect or missing FC-4 type information for the fcport, which could lead to compatibility issues or incorrect behavior.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to FC-4 type assignment in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential bug in the Linux kernel related to IPv6 packet fragmentation. The patch replaces the existing code that uses `BUG()` to report an error with `BUG_ON()`.

The `BUG_ON()` macro is a debugging aid that checks if a given condition is true and triggers a kernel panic if it is. This helps in identifying and debugging critical issues during development and testing.

In this case, the patch replaces the `BUG()` call with `BUG_ON()` in the `ip6_fragment()` function, specifically in the `skb_copy_bits()` call. This change ensures that if the `skb_copy_bits()` function fails to copy the IP datagram block, it will trigger a kernel panic.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a potential critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the `dvb_unregister_device()` function. Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or optimization.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to clean up the code by moving release handles into fail labels. This is a code organization improvement and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch does not mention any specific bug or issue it addresses.

3. The changes made in the patch do not seem to fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the TWL6030 MFD (Multi-Function Device) driver by introducing the ability to set wake-up functionality for the device's interrupt line. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a new feature to the driver. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is reverting the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT on the read syscall path in the perf subsystem. The reason for this change is that it breaks the standard way to read the counter, which is to open the counter, wait for the monitored process to die, and then read the counter.

The patch has been reported by Stephane Eranian and signed-off by Jiri Olsa. It has also been acknowledged by Stephane Eranian and Peter Zijlstra. There are several other individuals who have been copied on the patch for information.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a functional change to revert a check that was causing issues with the standard way of reading the counter.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the hfi1_query_qp function is being removed from the staging/rdma/hfi1/qp.c file. The function is also declared in the drivers/staging/rdma/hfi1/qp.h file and defined in the drivers/staging/rdma/hfi1/verbs.c file.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its impact and relevance. Here are the steps:

1. Review the patch description: The patch aims to remove the hfi1_query_qp function and rely on the rvt_query_qp function defined in rdmavt.

2. Review the code changes: The patch removes the entire hfi1_query_qp function implementation from qp.c. It also removes the function declaration from qp.h. Additionally, the patch removes the assignment of the hfi1_query_qp function to the query_qp field in the ib_device structure in verbs.c.

3. Analyze the impact: Removing the hfi1_query_qp function means that any code relying on this function will need to be updated to use the rvt_query_qp function instead. It is crucial to assess whether this change introduces any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical bugs.

4. Consider the significance of the change: The patch does not provide any specific information about the reason for removing the hfi1_query_qp function. Without further context, it is challenging to determine the significance of this change and whether it addresses a critical bug or issue.

Based on the analysis, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further information about the motivation behind removing the hfi1_query_qp function and its impact on the system is necessary to make an informed decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to prevent accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it has been reset. This is necessary because when the kernel reboots, the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called. The buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler, so it should not be updated if it has been reset.

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch involve modifying the bfin_serial_dma_tx_int() function in the bfin_uart.c file. The following changes are made:
   - The line "xmit->tail = (xmit->tail + uart->tx_count) & (UART_XMIT_SIZE - 1);" is removed.
   - The line "uart->port.icount.tx += uart->tx_count;" is retained.
   - The removed line is now placed inside an if condition, which checks if the xmit circular buffer is not empty.
   - The if condition is followed by the removed line and an additional if condition to check if there are fewer pending characters than WAKEUP_CHARS.
   - The code for bfin_serial_dma_tx_chars() is called at the end.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and code changes, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it has been reset. This issue could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems. The patch ensures that the buffer tail is not updated if it has been reset, preventing any potential issues.

4. Decision:
   Considering the nature of the issue being addressed and the changes made in the patch, it seems to fix a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch titled "ARM: i.MX5x clocks: Add EPIT support" adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem. It introduces new clock gates for EPIT1 and EPIT2 and registers them with the clock device framework.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to be adding necessary clock support for the EPIT hardware on the i.MX5x platform. This is not a trivial fix as it involves adding new clock gates and registering them with the clock device framework.

However, based on the information provided, it is not clear whether this patch fixes any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be an enhancement or addition of functionality rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, based on the given information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the correct variables in the `update_scan_rsp_data()` function. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to convert the usage of `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` in the `bond_debugfs.c` file of the bonding driver. This change improves consistency and allows for better integration with the networking subsystem.

The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing a warning message related to the registration and reregistration of the bonding device to the debugfs filesystem.

The change from `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` ensures that the warning message is associated with the specific network device (`bond->dev`) rather than being a generic warning. This can be helpful for debugging and identifying the specific device causing the issue.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue with the debugfs registration process in the bonding driver and improves the clarity of warning messages. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like build errors, hangs, or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the declaration of the "decon_crtc_ops" structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix in terms of spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to setting the `mask_pos` correctly in the PCI subsystem. The original code incorrectly calculated the value of `mask_pos` based on the `control` and `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` values.

The patch modifies the code to correctly calculate `mask_pos` based on the `control` value. It uses a conditional statement to check if `control` has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set. If it does, `mask_pos` is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, otherwise it is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this bug causes any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is not mentioned if this fix is non-trivial or if it only involves whitespace changes.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. More details about the bug and its impact would be necessary to make an informed decision.

2. Purpose: The purpose of using drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() is to avoid overwriting plane_state->fence if the user has already set an explicit fence.

3. Cc, Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by: The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the msm_atomic_commit() function by introducing a new variable, "fence," and using drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane_state.

5. Analysis: The patch appears to address a specific issue related to setting the fence in the msm_atomic_commit() function. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it seems to be a functional improvement or optimization.

6. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a functional improvement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the usage of a variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to clock aliases in the OMAP2+ ARM architecture. However, without further context or information about the bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug being fixed and any other relevant details to proceed with the analysis.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivarfs driver. The patch correctly changes the return type from ssize_t to size_t to avoid potential sign issues.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to newer versions of gcc and variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch aims to address the issue by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays directly.

However, the patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it fixes. It only refers to three bug reports related to the issue. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the problem being addressed.

Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to fall under the category of "trivial" fixes, as they involve modifying the way arrays are accessed. These changes do not seem to address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to debug information display in the mac80211 module. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" debug information outside the mesh_stats debug group and adds it separately. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to address a sparse warning. This fix does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds locking to improve concurrency and prevent potential race conditions.

Since this patch does not address a critical bug and contains a "trivial" fix (adding locking), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses the non-success return paths where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks in certain scenarios, such as when the card isn't ready or when the card is hardware-rfkilled.

The suggested fix includes deallocating the broadcast stations before returning an error in the __il4965_up() function. This ensures that the allocated memory is properly freed in these error cases.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can cause memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that can lead to resource exhaustion and instability in the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that eliminates the send buffers in the GSI receive QP. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch is titled "userns: Convert xenfs to use kuid and kgid where appropriate." This suggests that it aims to convert the xenfs filesystem to use kernel user identifiers (kuid and kgid) where necessary.

2. The patch includes changes to the file "drivers/xen/xenfs/super.c" and the file "init/Kconfig."

3. In the "drivers/xen/xenfs/super.c" file, the patch modifies the "xenfs_make_inode" function. It sets the i_uid and i_gid fields of the inode to GLOBAL_ROOT_UID and GLOBAL_ROOT_GID, respectively. This change ensures that the appropriate kernel user identifiers are used.

4. In the "init/Kconfig" file, the patch removes a dependency on XENFS for the UIDGID_CONVERTED configuration option. This suggests that the patch is making changes to ensure compatibility with other filesystems.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a code improvement to ensure compatibility and use of proper kernel user identifiers.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:

   - It fixes a documentation bug related to a warning about a bad line in the graph_mutex.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds code to check if the current graph walk object is large enough for all entities in the graph.
   - If the current graph walk object is not large enough, a new graph walk object is created and initialized.
   - The old graph walk object is cleaned up, and the new one is assigned to the media device's pm_count_walk.
   - The graph_mutex is locked during this process to ensure serialization.
   - The patch also adds a cleanup function to clean up the pm_count_walk graph walk object when the media device is being cleaned up.

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - It addresses a documentation bug and ensures that the graph walk object is large enough for all entities in the graph.
   - The changes are related to power management and do not seem to introduce any new issues.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It also contains a trivial fix related to documentation. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless conditional branch.

false || Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch description only mentions adding AR9580 support to the ath9k driver, and it includes the necessary changes to the PCI device table.

To make a decision, we need more information about the nature of the bug being fixed, whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases (such as causing a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue), and whether the patch contains any trivial fixes.

Without this additional information, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the 'i8254_osc_base' data from the boardinfo structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the removed line seems to be a configuration parameter that is the same for all board types.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a wait for one vblank before disabling CRCs in the i915 driver. This change is aimed at avoiding a spurious interrupt warning. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new member `resource` to the `struct drbd_device` in the `drbd_int.h` header file. This member is then assigned a value in the `drbd_create_minor` function in `drbd_main.c` and used in the `drbd_adm_prepare` function in `drbd_nl.c`.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the svcrpc module related to server thread shutdown. The patch adds locking around the traversal of the xprt_list to ensure proper synchronization.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a non-trivial issue related to locking, but it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only factors out a function and reorganizes the code, without introducing any significant changes or fixing any issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of the `led_info` structure in the `leds-pca963x.c` file. The patch initializes the `led` structure completely by using the `{}` initializer, which ensures that all fields are properly initialized.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to uninitialized data and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real issue. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a helper function called `dwc3_core_fifo_space` to the `dwc3` USB driver. This helper function is used to retrieve the available space in different queues and FIFOs in the `dwc3` controller. The purpose of this helper function is to facilitate debugging and potentially issue remote wakeup when starting a transfer.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, this patch seems to be adding a new feature rather than fixing an existing issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential security issue. The patch reintroduces a check to disallow world-writable files in sysfs. This check was previously removed but is now being reintroduced to ensure that all users are fixed.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a security issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a semicolon. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the values of n, m1, and m2 in the code. These values are used for clock calculations in the gma500 driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug. The change only modifies the return type of the `drm_pci_agp_init` function from `int` to `void`. This change does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix. The patch addresses the issue of freeing nf_bridge information after POST_ROUTING, as it is only needed for -m physdev. This change ensures that the allocation and free operations happen on the same CPU, which can improve performance.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a specific issue related to nf_bridge information.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an optimization or performance improvement. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "nice to have" rather than a critical bug fix.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the Lustre staging driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch fixes warnings related to pointer-to-integer casts and integer-to-pointer casts in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. These warnings occur when compiling a 64-bit kernel.

2. The warnings indicate potential issues with pointer size conversions, which can lead to compatibility problems or undefined behavior.

3. The patch introduces a new macro, IS_DMA_ALIGNED, which uses the IS_ALIGNED macro to check if a given address is aligned to the DMA_ALIGNMENT value.

4. The patch also modifies the initialization of the drv_data->null_dma_buf pointer, using the PTR_ALIGN macro instead of ALIGN.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the changes may seem trivial at first glance, they address warnings that can potentially lead to compatibility issues or undefined behavior when compiling a 64-bit kernel. Therefore, it qualifies as a non-trivial fix that improves the stability and reliability of the code.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of hardcoding it to the bit used by current Tegra GPUs. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the IOMMU functionality.

2. The patch adds a new member, "iommu_bit," to the "gk20a_instmem" structure. This member will store the IOMMU bit value.

3. In the "gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to clear the IOMMU bit instead of hardcoding the bit number. This change ensures that the pages are correctly unmapped.

4. In the "gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu" function, the patch again modifies the code to set the IOMMU bit instead of hardcoding the bit number. This change ensures that the address is resolved through the IOMMU.

5. In the "gk20a_instmem_new" function, the patch assigns the IOMMU bit value from the platform data to the "iommu_bit" member of the "gk20a_instmem" structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to the IOMMU functionality and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that replaces the module_init and module_exit calls with the module_i2c_driver macro. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the explicit initialization and cleanup functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function callback. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a new function `nvme_free_queue_mem()` to free the memory allocated for the admin queue in case of initialization failure. This function is then called in the `nvme_configure_admin_queue()` function when the device is not ready or when a fatal signal is pending.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to resource leakage. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new function and modifies the existing code to call it appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a coding style warning related to void function return statements. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the function `blkdev_mmap()` as static. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch allows vendor commands that require the WIPHY_VENDOR_CMD_NEED_RUNNING flag to be sent to the NAN (Neighborhood Aware Networking) interface.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Andrei Otcheretianski, Luca Coelho, and Johannes Berg, who are all from Intel.

3. Code changes: The code changes in the patch modify the nl80211_vendor_cmd function in the nl80211.c file.

4. Code analysis: The patch adds an additional condition to the if statement in the nl80211_vendor_cmd function. The new condition checks if the wireless device (wdev) is not associated with a network device, not in P2P mode, and not in NAN mode. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns -ENETDOWN, indicating that the network is down.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch allows vendor commands to be sent to the NAN interface only when the wireless device is not associated with a network device, not in P2P mode, and not in NAN mode. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for obtaining the BOS (Binary Object Store) descriptor test scenario for USB 3.0 in the usbtest module. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the usbtest module.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to a dentry leak in the greybus driver. The patch removes the debugfs file and disables USB logging, which suggests that it addresses a potential issue that could lead to resource leaks or other problems.

However, without further context or information about the severity of the bug, it is difficult to determine whether this patch qualifies as a critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not mention any specific build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues that it addresses.

Given the limited information provided, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it seems to address a relatively minor issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding stub functions for v_sys, refclk, and unipro resource management in the greybus subsystem. These stub functions are currently not implemented and return 0.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only adds stub functions without any implementation, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "dmaengine: edma: kill the tasklets upon exit". It suggests that the driver should ensure that tasklets are killed to prevent them from being executed after the driver is removed.

2. The patch adds a new function called "edma_cleanupp_vchan" which is responsible for cleaning up and killing the vchan tasklets.

3. In the "edma_remove" function, the "edma_cleanupp_vchan" function is called to clean up and kill the vchan tasklets before unregistering the DMA device.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue with tasklets not being properly killed upon driver removal. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes if the tasklets are executed after the driver is removed.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential issue that could cause unexpected behavior or crashes, it can be categorized as fixing an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch title: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: fixup FPGA ioremap area"
   - The patch appears to fix an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - The patch has two signed-off-by lines, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the mentioned individuals.

3. Code changes:
   - Line 42: The variable "fpga" is changed from a static variable to a non-static variable.
   - Line 66: The "fpga" variable is unmapped using the iounmap() function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is fixing an issue related to the FPGA ioremap area by making changes to the "fpga" variable. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or if it causes any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. Further analysis and information about the bug being fixed would be required to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the AXP20X and AXP22X battery drivers to the MFD cells of the AXP209, AXP221, and AXP223 MFDs. 

Since this patch is adding support for a new feature (battery driver) and does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply allows NULL or error pointers to be passed unconditionally, which simplifies error paths in drivers that use optional clocks. However, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds definitions for Skylake stepping revision IDs. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "ops" member of the "ds2404" structure. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for unregistering the connector during component removal in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds the necessary calls to unregister and cleanup the connector in the `hdmi_connector_destroy` function.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to component removal and ensures proper cleanup, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a real and critical bug. The patch modifies the dwc3_omap_probe function in the dwc3-omap.c file to mark the interrupt handler as shared using the IRQF_SHARED flag. This change is necessary on OMAPs to share the IRQ with the OTG device driver.

Since this patch addresses a critical issue related to interrupt handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria for inclusion.

The patch addresses a bug related to the pageflip finish event for interlace mode in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs. The bug occurs due to incorrect checking of the top field vsync by comparing the DMA address converted by start coordinates with the non-converted DMA address.

The patch modifies the mixer_irq_handler function in the exynos_mixer.c file. It introduces changes to the variable declarations and adds additional checks for the base and shadow registers in the interlace scan case.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause incorrect behavior in the interlace mode of the Exynos DRM driver. However, without further context or details about the bug's impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, additional information such as the severity of the bug, its impact on system stability, and whether it introduces any regressions or new issues should be considered.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a flag to indicate that a recovery work was initiated on purpose to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set.

2. The BUG_ON() macro is modified to include an additional condition that checks if the bug_on_recovery flag is set and if the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is not set in the wl->flags bitfield.

3. In the wl1271_op_add_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before initiating the recovery work.

4. In the wl1271_op_remove_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before queuing the recovery work.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary fix to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set. It also ensures that the recovery work is initiated intentionally by setting the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as build errors, oops, or hangs, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new sysfs file to show the Latency Tolerance Messaging (LTM) capabilities of USB devices. This does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to the call_usermodehelper_fns() function in the KEYS subsystem. The patch replaces the call to call_usermodehelper_fns() with a combination of call_usermodehelper_setup() and call_usermodehelper_exec() functions.

The patch aims to address a potential problem where the cleanup function may not be called in case of an out-of-memory (OOM) condition. This could result in a missed call to key_put(), which could lead to resource leaks.

Considering the patch addresses a potential bug that could cause data corruption or resource leaks, it falls under the category of fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the netfilter hashlimit module. The patch moves the rateinfo initialization to a helper function called rateinfo_init. This change helps to avoid bloating the main match function.

The patch itself does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or code refactoring change rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new function `dso__last_symbol()` to find the last symbol in a DSO (Dynamic Shared Object). This function will be used when parsing address filters to calculate a region that includes the entire DSO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze if this patch meets the requirements:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? No, it does not fix a bug but rather adds a new function.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption? No, it does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it fix a real security issue? No, it does not address a security vulnerability.

4. Does it fix an "oh, that's not good" issue? No, it does not fix any problematic behavior.

5. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? No, it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that made changes to the ARM shmobile emev2 code. The reason for the revert is mentioned as changing the flags of the wrong CPUs, which breaks the bootup of secondary CPUs.

The patch itself does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to the wrong CPU flags, which may not fall under the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes deprecated usage of the `cpus_` functions in the IA64 architecture code. The changes involve replacing the deprecated functions with the corresponding `cpumask_` functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that constifies the ACPI device ID array in the spi-pxa2xx.c file. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a numeric value with a defined constant. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be modifying the nve0_fifo_intr_engine function in the nve0.c file of the nouveau driver. It adds a new function called nve0_fifo_intr_engine, which triggers a specific event when called. This new function is then called within the nve0_fifo_intr function.

Based on the provided patch, it seems that the changes are related to handling interrupts in the nve0_fifo_intr function. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical bug.

To make an informed decision, we would need more details about the bug being fixed and its impact on the system. Without this information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Insufficient information to make a decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by removing unnecessary comparisons. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it only improves code readability without addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling `schedule_work()`. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the i2c-mxs driver. The bug causes slow scanning of the i2c bus due to the driver ignoring the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit during the busy-waiting loop. The patch adds a check for the NO_SLAVE_ACK bit and returns an error if it is set, which should prevent the slow scanning issue.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the i2c-mxs driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error when the mc138xxx driver is built as a module. The error is related to undefined symbols "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" in the mc13892-regulator.ko module.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, the changes in the patch are trivial, as they only export two symbols using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which removes a whitespace before a parenthesis, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a checkpatch warning. The change only involves reformatting the syslog message to fit within the recommended coding style. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential scheduling issue caused by calling `clk_get_rate()` in `sdhci_s3c_set_clock()`, which may sleep. The patch modifies the driver to cache the rates of all bus clocks at probe time and then only use those cached values.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to the initialization of the `mtd_oob_ops` structure in the `nand_base.c` file. The patch initializes the structure using `memset` instead of explicitly setting individual fields to NULL.

The patch also mentions that the ooblen field is not being initialized, but it is not critical since users check if oobbuf is NULL first. However, it is considered good practice to zero out unused fields.

The patch includes a reference to Coverity IDs #200821 and #200822, indicating that the issue was identified by static code analysis.

Overall, the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it addresses an issue that can be considered as "oh, that's not good" and improves code quality by following good practices.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, which fixes a "line over 80" issue and resolves a "blank line" issue, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug. The change only involves removing a comment and reordering the lines of code. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change simply moves the assignment of `gpio_base = -1` to an earlier position in the code. This does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the f2fs filesystem. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch title suggests that it aims to detect an error in the `update_dent_inode` function during a rename operation in the f2fs filesystem.

2. The patch adds a check to verify the return value of the `update_dent_inode` function after it is called with the `old_inode`, `new_inode`, and `new_dentry->d_name` parameters.

3. If the return value of `update_dent_inode` is non-zero (indicating an error), the patch releases an orphan inode and jumps to the `put_out_dir` label, which handles the error condition.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a potential error scenario in the f2fs filesystem's rename operation. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new check and handles the error condition appropriately.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues during a rename operation in the f2fs filesystem.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

1. The patch adds support for different MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths, allowing separate buffers for each. This can be useful for optimizing performance or addressing specific hardware requirements. This is not a trivial fix and can be considered a valuable enhancement.

2. The patch also handles the case where only one MMIO region is specified, assuming it is shared between Rx and Tx for backward compatibility. This ensures compatibility with existing systems.

3. The patch assigns the Tx channel to Rx if the MMIO regions are different and Rx is not specified. This ensures that the system can still function properly even if the Rx channel is not explicitly specified.

4. The patch includes changes to the read and write operations for handling the separate MMIO regions. It correctly copies data to and from the respective MMIO regions.

5. The patch also handles the case where the Rx channel is not specified but has a separate Rx MMIO region. In this case, the Rx channel is set to the same channel as Tx, ensuring proper functionality.

6. The patch includes proper error handling, such as returning -EPROBE_DEFER if both the Tx and Rx channels are not available.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue by adding support for separate Tx and Rx buffers with dedicated MMIO regions. It does not contain any trivial fixes and provides valuable enhancements to the mailbox subsystem.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a line over 80 characters warning detected by the checkpatch.pl script. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the code. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to passing the wrong value as an argument for PTR_ERR(). This bug could potentially lead to incorrect error handling and reporting. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that can be categorized as an "oh, that's not good" issue, as it could lead to incorrect error reporting.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a non-trivial issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. The patch only involves inlining the ATS setup code into the `pci_ats_init()` function, without any functional change.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring patch that improves code readability by breaking up the handle_cmd_completion() function into smaller functions. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "_single" suffix from the page table allocator function names. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the parameter 'dma_mask' to 'max_addr' in the blk_queue_bounce_limit() function. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional change.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is as follows:

```
ste_dma40: Delete an unnecessary variable initialisation in d40_probe()

The variable "res" will eventually be set to a resource pointer from
a call of the d40_hw_detect_init(() function.

Based on the provided patch, it seems to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary variable initialization in the `d40_probe()` function. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue causes an oops when Q_GETNEXTQUOTA is called for a filesystem with quotas disabled.

2. The fix checks early whether the filesystem has quotas enabled before proceeding with ocfs2_get_next_id().

3. The patch includes a signed-off-by line, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

4. The changes made in the patch are not trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. They directly address the bug and improve the stability of the system.

Therefore, considering the critical nature of the bug and the appropriate fix provided in the patch, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a change related to ACPI Power Management Timer (PM Timer) in the ACPICA subsystem. The patch makes the PM Timer optional, aligning with ACPI 5.0A specifications.

Since the change doesn't directly affect Linux and doesn't fix any real and critical bug, it seems to be more of an enhancement or compatibility improvement rather than a fix for an existing issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated function `simple_strtoul` with the recommended function `kstrtoul`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an extra variable declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for whitespace issues in the `spidev_test` file. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as whitespace cleanups should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch increases the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw driver.

2. It adds a new variable "maxdelay" and initializes it to 1000.

3. It checks if the current channel is set and adjusts the "maxdelay" based on the channel rate. If the channel is half-rate, "maxdelay" is multiplied by 2. If the channel is quarter-rate, "maxdelay" is multiplied by 4.

4. It writes a value to the AR_Q_TXD register to abort the transmission DMA.

5. It sets some bits in various registers to force quiet collision, clear virtual MAC filter, and force channel idle high.

6. It sets a loop to iterate over the QCU queues and waits for a certain delay before aborting the transmission. The delay is controlled by the "maxdelay" variable.

7. Inside the loop, it introduces a delay of 5 microseconds using the udelay() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces changes to the timeout calculation and the delay loop.

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision at this point.

To make an informed decision, it would be helpful to have additional information about the bug or issue being addressed and any relevant test results or feedback from users or developers.
false || Based on the provided patch, which only reformats pointer variables in the `main.c` file of the `staging/speakup` directory, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the driver from "ohci" to "ohci-da8xx" for consistency with other USB drivers. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the hwmon driver for the LM63 chip. It adds information about the LM64 and LM96163 chips having separate pins for fan monitoring and alert out, and that monitoring is always enabled on the LM64.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only updates the documentation, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary iteration and uses the passed argument directly. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch adds a module license to the dwc-xlgmac driver in the Linux kernel. The lack of a license was causing a warning during module building. The patch fixes this issue by adding the "GPL" license tag to the driver.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that addresses a warning related to module licensing.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/nouveau/device: type-safe register accessor macros". It suggests that the patch introduces type-safe register accessor macros for the drm/nouveau/device subsystem.

2. The patch modifies the `nvkm_device` structure by adding privileged register interface accessor macros.

3. The added macros (`nvkm_rd08`, `nvkm_rd16`, `nvkm_rd32`, `nvkm_wr08`, `nvkm_wr16`, `nvkm_wr32`, `nvkm_mask`) provide read and write access to device registers.

4. The macros use the `ioread8`, `ioread16_native`, `ioread32_native`, `iowrite8`, `iowrite16_native`, and `iowrite32_native` functions for register access.

5. The `nvkm_mask` macro performs a read-modify-write operation on a register, applying a mask to clear specific bits and then setting new values.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a functional enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. It introduces type-safe register accessor macros, which can improve code readability and maintainability. However, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical problems.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for legacy initialization of the wl12xx wireless module on VAR-STK/DVK-OM44 boards in the OMAP2+ ARM architecture.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming some variables and arguments in the function `ced_get_out_buf_space()`. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1) The patch fixes two bugs in the __lpc_handle_xmit() function of the lpc_eth driver.

2) The first bug is that it can leak skbs (socket buffers) if TXSTATUS_ERROR is set. This bug can potentially lead to resource leaks and memory issues.

3) The second bug is that it can wake up the txqueue even when no slot was freed. This bug can cause incorrect behavior and potential race conditions.

4) The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

5) The bug was reported by Roland Stigge and tested by the same person, indicating that the issue has been verified and confirmed.

6) The patch is also CC'd to Kevin Wells, suggesting that the relevant parties have been notified.

7) The patch is also signed-off by David S. Miller, who is a maintainer of the Linux kernel networking subsystem.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes real and critical bugs that can cause incorrect behavior and potential resource leaks. It also has the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgments from relevant parties. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue where the cmos interrupt handler is allowed to run before resuming, causing problems with the alarm timer not being removed. This can lead to other timers not being cleared, resulting in timeouts for utilities like hwclock.

2. Impact:
   The issue described in the patch does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that can potentially affect the functionality of utilities relying on the update interrupt.

3. Patch Changes:
   The patch adds a check to enable hpet_rtc_timer_init only if the device may wake up. This change ensures that the call to hpet_rtc_timer_init is not undone during resume.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the issue addressed by the patch does not seem critical enough to warrant inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. Conclusion:
   Considering the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further review and input from the Linux kernel maintainers would be necessary to make a final decision.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be required for a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two issues related to the update-qp command in the mlx4_core driver. The first issue is a wrong bit mask for the supported driver features, and the second issue is a wrongly voided return value of the mlx4_update_qp() function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze each issue:

1. Wrong bit mask for supported driver features:
   This issue seems to be a bug that could potentially cause incorrect behavior or functionality in the driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting the definition of the bit mask. Therefore, this issue can be considered a real and critical bug that should be fixed.

2. Wrongly voided return value of mlx4_update_qp():
   This issue involves correcting the return value of a function call within the SRIOV resource-tracker. While the patch does fix this issue, it is not clear from the provided information whether this issue has any significant impact on the system's behavior or functionality. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if this issue qualifies as a real and critical bug.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting the patch for the first issue (wrong bit mask for supported driver features) as it appears to fix a real and critical bug. However, further investigation or clarification is needed to determine if the second issue (wrongly voided return value) should be considered for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add missing configuration for MBUS windows access protection in the mvneta_conf_mbus_windows function of the mvneta driver. The patch includes the addition of a new register definition (MVNETA_ACCESS_PROTECT_ENABLE) and writes the corresponding value (win_protect) to it.

Since this patch addresses a missing configuration and ensures that the register contents are not inherited from the bootloader, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the usage of prsctp policies in the sctp module. The patch changes the check for prsctp enablement from `asoc->prsctp_enable` to `asoc->peer.prsctp_capable`, which ensures that prsctp is enabled on both the local and peer hosts.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing break statement in the set control handler of the tvp5150 driver. It fixes a potential issue where the hue control could enable or disable the decode completely.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The Tilera boot infrastructure now provides the initramfs to Linux with a different name, "initramfs", instead of "initramfs.cpio.gz". This change allows for the use of other compression techniques without causing confusion.

2. The patch ensures compatibility with older kernels: By falling back to checking for the old name, the patch ensures that older kernels remain compatible with the newer Tilera boot infrastructure.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a significant change in the boot infrastructure and is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and includes appropriate Cc's to relevant parties.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the issue and maintain compatibility with the Tilera boot infrastructure.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug related to the async_probe generic module parameter, which causes a crash when used.
2. The bug was introduced in commit f2411da746985, which added async probe support but failed to add the required argument in the parse_args() function.
3. The patch correctly adds the missing argument in the parse_args() function, fixing the crash issue.
4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, including Luis R. Rodriguez and Rusty Russell.
5. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org (4.2+)), indicating its importance for maintaining stability.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference in the bcm2835_i2c_isr() function. This bug was introduced in the commit e2474541032d, and the patch aims to handle the unexpected interrupt with an error message instead of crashing.

Considering that the bug can lead to a crash and the patch addresses the issue by providing error handling, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the translation of source code lines for call chains of user space applications in the perf report tool. The patch changes the usage of the "ip" variable to the "addr" variable in the addr_location structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be a fix for improving the accuracy of the perf report tool's output.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses an issue where kprobes fail to find symbols even if they exist in the map (dso). The current implementation relies on `map__load()` to find symbols, which does not work for kprobes as it reuses an existing kernel map. To fix this, the patch suggests using `map__find_symbol_by_name()` instead, which loads a map with full symbols and sorts them by name.

The patch also introduces a new function `find_probe_functions()` that uses `map__find_symbol_by_name()` to search for symbols in the map. It iterates through the symbols and counts the number of matched functions.

In the `find_probe_trace_events_from_map()` function, the patch replaces the previous implementation with a call to `find_probe_functions()` to find the matched symbols. If no symbols are found, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code.

The patch then continues to iterate through the symbols using `symbol__next_by_name()` and performs necessary operations for each symbol found.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to kprobes and improves the efficiency of symbol searching. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the code related to setting the 'action' to 'idle' in the md (multiple devices) subsystem. The issue arises when checking the 'sync_thread' variable without holding the 'mddev_lock'. This can lead to a race condition where md_check_recovery could reap the thread and start another thread, causing confusion.

The patch proposes a solution by introducing a check for the MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING flag before acquiring the 'mddev_lock'. If the flag is set, the patch flushes the workqueue, reaps the sync thread, and then releases the lock. This ensures that the race condition is avoided and prevents confusion caused by multiple threads starting.

The patch also includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the fix and understanding its context.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to confusion and potential issues, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the recommended decision is (A) to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the debugfs entry creation path in the f2fs filesystem. It moves the initialization of the "status" debugfs entry to the init part of f2fs and the destruction to the exit part. This change ensures that the "status" entry is maintained for the entire F2FS filesystem, regardless of the number of partitions.

The patch also introduces two new functions: f2fs_create_root_stats and f2fs_destroy_root_stats. The former creates the debugfs directory "f2fs" and the "status" file within it, while the latter removes the debugfs directory.

Additionally, the patch removes the init_stats function and modifies the f2fs_build_stats function to call init_stats internally. The destroy_root_stats function is also removed.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a code refactoring and reorganization to improve the debugfs entry creation path.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The call to topology_init is too late for the set_sched_topology call. This suggests that there is a bug causing a timing issue in the current implementation.

2. The patch proposes a solution: It suggests using the smp_cpus_done() call to register the s390 specific topology array early enough. This change ensures that the set_sched_topology call is made at the appropriate time.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other non-critical modifications. It focuses solely on fixing the timing issue.

4. The patch is targeted for stable releases: The Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org indicates that this patch is suitable for stable releases, specifically for versions v3.16 and above.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to timing and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the TX queue stop/wake flow in the mlx4_en driver. The issue is that the "blocked" flag is redundant and can lead to a race condition. The patch removes the "blocked" flag and replaces it with a check using the netif_tx_queue_stopped function to avoid the race condition.

The patch also includes some code cleanup by removing the unnecessary assignment of "blocked" flag and initializing it to 0 in mlx4_en_activate_tx_ring function.

The changes in mlx4_en_process_tx_cq function ensure that the TX queue is woken up only if it was previously stopped and at least one packet was completed. This improves the efficiency of the TX queue handling.

In mlx4_en_xmit function, the patch removes the assignment of "blocked" flag and the subsequent queue stop operation. This is because the queue is already stopped when it becomes full, and there is no need to explicitly set the "blocked" flag.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the TX queue stop/wake flow and improves the code by removing redundant and unnecessary operations. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak in the error path of the function `rsi_send_auto_rate_request()` in the `rsi_91x_mgmt.c` file. The patch frees the previously allocated `skb` in case memory allocation for the `selected_rates` array fails.

Since this patch addresses a potential memory leak, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it only addresses a potential memory leak and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HID i2c-hid driver. It fixes a problem where the driver fails to probe if GPIO support is not enabled in the kernel configuration. The issue was introduced in a previous commit that did not handle the case when GPIO support is disabled.

The patch checks the return value of the acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() function and only fails the probe if the return value is negative and not equal to -ENXIO. This ensures that the driver does not fail if GPIO support is not enabled, as intended.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by a user, and it is signed-off by the relevant developers.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that can cause the driver to fail probing, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

5. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the "reserved_4" field in the "struct vp_rpt_id_entry_24xx" by reducing its size from 28 bytes to 24 bytes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a valid fix for a specific issue related to the qla2xxx driver. However, without further context or knowledge about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and evaluation by the appropriate maintainers and reviewers to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the nvme/pci driver. The patch addresses a situation where an 'nvme reset /dev/nvme0' command would block indefinitely because the queues were not frozen properly. 

The patch modifies the nvme_dev_disable() function in the drivers/nvme/host/pci.c file. It adds an additional condition to freeze the queues when the controller state is either NVME_CTRL_LIVE or NVME_CTRL_RESETTING.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a hang or data corruption. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to storing the status of registers in the s390/kvm code. The patch ensures that the ACRS/FPRS registers are up-to-date before saving them into the save area. This fix addresses potential issues with stale register values and strange problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect register values and potential issues with hotplug and virtio-ccw. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a critical bug that can cause a segmentation fault when using the perf probe command with a glob. The bug occurs when add_probe_trace_event() fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob, leading to a segfault.

The patch ensures that add_probe_trace_event() does not modify tf->ntevs and tf->tevs if the function fails. It also adds error handling to free allocated memory and clear the probe_trace_event in case of failure.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can cause a segmentation fault, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function in `fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c`. This is done because `s_dirty` is reset under that mutex.

2. The previous condition was incorrect because it did not consider cases where a checkpoint was done followed by all the node pages being written back. The patch fixes this issue.

3. The patch introduces a new label `out` and a `goto` statement to skip the checkpoint if `s_dirty` is not set. This ensures that the checkpoint is only performed when necessary.

4. The `unblock_operations` function is called after the checkpoint is completed.

5. The `stat_inc_cp_count` function is called to increment the checkpoint count in the statistics.

6. The `mutex_unlock` function is called to release the `cp_mutex`.

7. The `write_checkpoint` function is called from `f2fs_sync_fs` in `fs/f2fs/super.c` when `sync` is true.

8. In `f2fs_sync_fs`, the patch removes the previous condition that checked if `s_dirty` is not set and if there are no dirty nodes. This condition is no longer needed because the `write_checkpoint` function now handles the check for `s_dirty`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the checkpointing process in the F2FS filesystem. It ensures that the checkpoint is only performed when necessary and under the correct mutex. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to handle races with hardware (HW) when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The patch fixes a potential race condition where a short time to the next alarm could result in a delay of approximately 4 seconds until it triggers.

3. The patch introduces a check after updating the HW to ensure that the alarm timestamp is still in the future. If it is, the alarm is scheduled, and if not, it is moved to the completed list.

4. If there are no more pending alarms, the interrupt is shut down.

5. Finally, the completed callbacks are executed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential race condition and ensures that alarms are scheduled correctly. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could cause delays in alarm triggering.

1. Description of the issue:
   The patch addresses an issue specific to an Access Point (AP) scenario. When the AP is initially started with WEP security and an external station is connected, the data path works correctly. However, if the AP is restarted with WPA/WPA2 security, the station is able to connect but ping fails.

2. Proposed fix:
   The driver currently skips the deletion of WEP keys if the interface type is AP. The patch suggests removing this redundant check to resolve the issue.

3. Fixes:
   The patch references a previous commit that introduced key material v2 support.

4. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by three individuals: Ganapathi Bhat, Amitkumar Karwar, and Kalle Valo.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses an issue that can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ci13xxx_udc driver. The bug causes bogus data to be sent due to incorrect handling of the request's DMA address. The patch addresses this issue by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that reduces the memory footprint for debugging purposes. The patch removes the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() and replaces it with a kernel helper function printk() to dump the data. This change reduces the code complexity and improves maintainability.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it only involves a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses unused return smatch warnings in the tcmu_netlink_event function. The warnings indicate that the return values of nla_put_string and nla_put_u32 are not being used.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only addresses unused return warnings, which are considered trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves a minor cleanup for FRAC_BITS. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

2. The bug causes a build error: The debug output shows that the fault occurs in the huge fault code.

3. The patch fixes the bug by adding fallback handling: The driver fails to fallback when encountering faults larger than the device alignment or when handling larger faults with a smaller mapping already established. The patch forces fallback until the fault size matches the alignment.

4. The patch includes relevant information: It includes a detailed report by Jeff Moyer, who experienced the issue, and is signed-off by Dave Jiang and Dan Williams.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a significant issue and does not include spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

Based on these points, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and ensure proper functionality of the device dax driver.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a bug related to the badness score calculation in the out-of-memory (OOM) killer. The bug occurs when the privileges given to root threads or the value of /proc/pid/oom_score_adj exceed the resident set size (rss) of a thread, causing the badness score to overflow. 

The patch fixes this issue by changing the type of the "points" variable to "long" and ensuring that a negative value is treated as 1, indicating that the thread is still eligible for kill. This prevents the badness score from underflowing.

The patch has been reported by Dave Jones and acknowledged by Oleg Nesterov. It has also been signed-off by David Rientjes and Linus Torvalds.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect behavior in the OOM killer, it should be included in Linux -stable releases.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the provided information.

The patch addresses a bug that can occur in rare cases where the entire ring is filled without emitting a request. This can lead to a situation where the allocated seqno for the operation is cleared, triggering a sanity check failure. The fix involves rearranging the code to ensure that the allocation of the seqno is done after any required flushes of outstanding operations.

Based on the provided description, it seems that this bug can potentially cause data corruption or unexpected behavior in certain scenarios. Therefore, it can be considered a real and critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, it fixes an issue related to the virtual monitor interface iteration.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description, but based on the context, it seems to be a functional issue rather than a security issue.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: It does not appear to contain trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug reported by Dan Carpenter's static checker. The bug is related to the "credits" variable, which is defined as an int but should be an unsigned variable since the value comes from the server as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

The bug can potentially lead to an underflow in the logic, causing a deadlock of the mount point by blocking the client from issuing more RPC requests. This is a significant issue that can impact the stability and functionality of the system.

The patch fixes the bug by changing the type of the "credits" variable to u32, ensuring that it can store the unsigned value received from the server correctly.

true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix an oops issue in the musb_gadget_pullup() function of the USB driver. The oops occurs when the gadget driver calls usb_gadget_connect() without the USB cable being plugged into the OTG port. The issue is caused by accessing MUSB's memory space while its clock is turned off due to pm_runtime kicking in.

To fix the issue, the patch encloses musb_gadget_pullup() with pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put() calls to ensure that the clock is always turned on when reaching that path.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes an oops, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes, as it focuses on resolving a specific issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for a specific hardware configuration. The patch extends the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board connector quirk to cover a newer silicon stepping with a new PCI ID. This is necessary to correctly mark the back plane connectors.

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or workaround rather than a fix for a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch fixes a return value check in the usbhs_mod_gadget_probe() function in the renesas_usbhs driver. The current code checks for a NULL return value from usb_get_phy(), but the function actually returns ERR_PTR() in case of an error. The patch replaces the NULL test with IS_ERR() to correctly handle the error condition.

The patch also includes the Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit. It has been Acked-by Yoshihiro Shimoda and signed-off by Wei Yongjun and Felipe Balbi.

Since the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact. 

The patch addresses a deadlock issue caused by a race condition between relocation and snapshot creation in the Btrfs file system. It specifically fixes the deadlock by modifying the block reservation function used during snapshot creation.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a deadlock. Deadlocks can cause system hangs and impact system stability, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a warning in the of_free_opp_table() function in the drivers/base/power/opp.c file. The patch addresses the issue of crashing in dev_name() when find_device_opp() returns ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) and also avoids splatting a warning when OPP is not defined for a device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a warning cleanup and handling improvement.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is intended to fix a regression introduced by commit 027bd7e89906 in the xenbus_dev_request_and_reply() function. The regression causes failed XS_TRANSACTION_START messages to leave the transaction open, which can lead to problems with suspend and migration.

The patch itself removes a section of code that was added accidentally and is not necessary for fixing the regression. It removes the early return statement when ret is an error, which was causing the transaction to remain open.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that can cause problems with suspend and migration. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new software pte flag called L_PTE_NONE. This flag is set to identify faulting, present entries. The patch modifies various files in the ARM architecture to include this new flag in the page protection attributes.

From the description, it seems that the patch aims to address an issue where PROT_NONE mappings can be accessed by the kernel, allowing tasks to read PROT_NONE pages via syscalls such as read/write over a pipe. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug related to security and data access, which falls within the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt routing in the GEN9 hardware of the i915 driver. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `btrfs_init_test_fs()` function. The patch ensures that a negative error code is returned from the `kern_mount()` error handling case instead of 0, which is set by `register_filesystem`. This change is consistent with the error handling approach used elsewhere in the function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug by fixing an error return code, it can be considered for inclusion in a stable release. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the return value to correctly handle errors during the mount process.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the ratelimit code. Currently, when the ratelimit interval is passed (case #2), the `begin` value is set to 0. This leads to improper suppression because the time interval check will always be false, and `rs->printed` will not be initialized. As a result, even if enough time has passed, ratelimit may return 0 if `rs->printed` is not less than `rs->burst`.

To fix this issue, the patch suggests setting `begin` to `jiffies` instead of 0. This ensures that the interval is properly reset, allowing the ratelimit to function correctly.

The patch includes a test case that demonstrates the problem and shows the expected behavior after applying the fix.

Considering that the patch addresses a bug that can lead to incorrect suppression and affects the functionality of the ratelimit feature, it qualifies as a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes like spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the behavior of the UDP error handler in both IPv4 and IPv6 code paths.
2. In the IPv4 code path, the patch changes the handling of ICMP redirects. Instead of calling `ipv4_sk_redirect()`, it now jumps to the `out` label, effectively skipping the redirect handling.
3. In the IPv6 code path, the patch adds similar handling for NDISC redirects. It calls `ip6_sk_redirect()` and then jumps to the `out` label.
4. The `out` label is defined later in the code and is used to skip the rest of the error handling code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is modifying the behavior of the UDP error handler to not report ICMP redirects to user space. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or behavior change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a regression in HDMI audio functionality for the nv84 GPU. The patch adds missing code that was removed during a code refactoring commit, resulting in HDMI audio working again.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of HDMI audio, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the patch author mentions that they were only able to test it on one HDMI head and it might be necessary to add similar code for nva3, which they couldn't test. This limitation should be taken into account during the evaluation process.

In summary, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the RGMII_MODE_EN bit in the bcmgenet driver. The patch correctly updates the value of RGMII_MODE_EN from 0 to 6, which is necessary for newer GENET controllers to enable their RGMII data-pad.

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the `md/raid5` module. The bug is described as `drop_one_stripe()` being called with `max_nr_stripes == 0`, which should not be allowed. The patch adds a test to ensure `max_nr_stripes` is kept above `min_nr_stripes` and uses a 'mask' instead of a 'mod' in `drop_one_stripe` to ensure the validity of 'hash' even if `max_nr_stripes` reaches zero.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses a real issue where the ADS7846 regulator is disabled twice in a row in the ads7846_remove() function. The redundant regulator_disable() call causes a warning about unbalanced disables, which can lead to potential issues.

By removing the redundant regulator_disable() call, the patch resolves the warning and ensures proper handling of the regulator. This fix qualifies as a real and critical bug that can cause issues such as unbalanced disables, which can lead to system instability or data corruption.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which aligns with the requirement for Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific quirk for the Acer Aspire 5734Z machine to invert the panel backlight brightness value.

Since it does not fix a critical bug, a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch disables register synchronization for low-frequency SYSCLK in the WM8996 codec. It mentions that with a low-frequency SYSCLK and a fast I2C clock, register synchronization may occasionally take too long to take effect, causing I/O issues. Disabling synchronization is proposed to avoid these issues.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function in `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.c` and adds a new variable `sync` initialized with the value of `WM8996_REG_SYNC`. It then updates the value of `sync` to 0 when the clock rate is 32000 or 32768. Finally, it updates the `WM8996_CONTROL_INTERFACE_1` register with the value of `sync` using `snd_soc_update_bits`.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch aims to address potential I/O issues caused by register synchronization delays when using a low-frequency SYSCLK with a fast I2C clock. By disabling synchronization in specific clock rate scenarios, it attempts to avoid these issues.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   Based on the provided information, it is not explicitly mentioned that this patch fixes a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue related to I/O problems. The impact of the issue is not clearly defined, so it is difficult to assess its criticality accurately.

Considering the analysis above, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a (B) "should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK)" unless further information is provided to demonstrate the criticality of the I/O issues and their potential impact on system stability or security.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The code in the paging_init() function is ineffective in detecting unsupported highmem due to dcache aliasing, leading to potential coherency issues or triggering a BUG_ON in flush_kernel_dcache_page().

2. The patch fixes the issue by running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(), ensuring that the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro evaluates correctly and the unsupported highmem case is detected successfully.

3. The patch also resolves a hidden issue where mem_init_free_highmem() attempts to free all highmem pages, even though they are not used and lack valid page structs. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception. The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates true, avoiding the issue.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone peer review.

Considering the critical bug fix and the proper resolution of the issue, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to duration calculation for non-aggregated packets in the ath9k wireless driver. The patch overrides the length in ath_tx_fill_desc before passing it to ath_buf_set_rate, which addresses the broken duration calculation.

1. The patch addresses a specific bug introduced by commit 2ae66c26550cd94b0e2606a9275eb0ab7070ad0e, which caused a regression on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI.

2. The bug occurs because the driver modifies the global variable align_buffer_size when an Intel controller is found, but the Nvidia HDMI controller is probed after Intel, and Nvidia chips require aligned buffers.

3. The patch fixes the problem by moving the flag into the local struct, ensuring it is not affected by other controllers.

4. The patch includes a reference to the bug report in Bugzilla, providing additional information about the issue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption or other issues on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

7. The patch modifies the bgmac_poll function in the bgmac driver.

8. The modification in the patch changes the return value of the function from "handled" to "weight" when certain conditions are met.

9. The modified condition checks if there are more events (BGMAC_IS_TX0 or BGMAC_IS_RX) that arrived since the last poll. If so, the function returns the weight, indicating that NAPI should call it again.

10. If the handled value is less than the weight, the function calls napi_complete to indicate that the polling is complete.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to the bgmac driver and modifies the bgmac_poll function to ensure that NAPI is called again when necessary. The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

5. The addition of the reservation object ensures that these functions are called with a valid reservation object, preventing a crash.
6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug and does not include any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang due to a race condition on thread termination. This qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

2. The patch introduces a new flag, DM_CRYPT_EXIT_THREAD, to signal the kernel thread to exit. This flag is set and tested while holding the cc->write_thread_wait.lock, ensuring there is no racy access to the flag.

3. The patch removes an unnecessary set_task_state(current, TASK_RUNNING) following the schedule() call. This cleanup is considered trivial and does not affect the critical bug fix.

4. The patch includes the Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug, which helps in tracking the bug fix.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the relevant developers.

Considering these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the race condition and prevent the potential hang issue.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver.

2. Code changes: The code changes involve modifying the `ath_tid_drain` function in the `ath9k/xmit.c` file.

3. Issue addressed: The patch addresses a situation where an A-MPDU subframe can still have `fi->retries` at 0 after a transmission attempt, which can occur if the retry count wasn't incremented due to powersave. In such cases, the subframe is still tracked as part of the block ack window. The issue is that when draining the tid queue, the sequence number of the subframe needs to be cleared from the pending frame bitmap.

4. Code changes analysis:
   - The patch removes the condition `if (fi->retries)` that was previously used to check if the subframe had retries. This means that the sequence number will now be cleared from the pending frame bitmap regardless of the retry count.
   - The `ath_tx_update_baw` function is called unconditionally to update the block ack window with the sequence number of the subframe.
   - The `ath_tx_complete_buf` function is called to complete the transmission of the buffer.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to draining aggregation tid buffers in the ath9k driver. The changes made in the patch seem reasonable and relevant to fixing the issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential buffer overflow issue in the HFS file system. The patch adds a sanity check for the file name length and limits it to HFS_NAMELEN if it exceeds that value.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential security issue (buffer overflow) and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: quirk asserts controllable backlight presence, overriding VBT". It suggests that the patch is related to the i915 driver for Intel graphics.

2. The commit message explains that the patch addresses a regression caused by a misconfigured VBT (Video BIOS Table) on certain machines. The patch adds a quirk to assert the presence of a controllable backlight and uses it to ignore the VBT backlight presence check during backlight setup.

3. The patch includes a Bugzilla reference (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79813) indicating that it addresses a specific bug.

4. The patch has been tested by James Duley and Michael Mullin, as mentioned in the "Tested-by" lines.

7. The patch includes the "Signed-off-by" lines from Scot Doyle, Jani Nikula, and Daniel Vetter.

8. The patch adds a new quirk flag, QUIRK_BACKLIGHT_PRESENT, to the i915 driver.

9. The patch modifies the intel_panel.c file to handle the case when the VBT does not indicate the presence of a backlight.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a regression caused by a misconfigured VBT and adds a quirk to handle the backlight presence. It fixes a real issue and does not contain trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to double accounting in the cpu-timer code. The issue is that the delta for the calling task is added twice, causing the sample to run ahead and making the sleep short. 

The patch modifies the `cpu_timer_sample_group()` function in `kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c` to remove the addition of `task_delta_exec(p)` from the `CPUCLOCK_SCHED` case. Instead, it only assigns `cputime.sum_exec_runtime` to the `*sample` variable.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or performance problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to UVD suspend and resume for VI APU in the AMDGPU driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check to skip the suspend and resume operations for APUs (Accelerated Processing Units). This suggests that the suspend and resume operations are not applicable or not required for APUs. This change seems reasonable and specific to the hardware architecture.

2. The patch also includes a call to `uvd_v6_0_hw_fini()` and `uvd_v6_0_hw_init()` functions, which handle the hardware initialization and finalization for UVD (Unified Video Decoder) version 6.0. These functions are specific to the UVD version 6.0 and are not trivial changes.

3. The patch does not introduce any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to UVD suspend and resume for VI APU in the AMDGPU driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to be a non-trivial fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is reverting the default behavior of link protections in the VFS (Virtual File System) of the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that the new link protections introduced in a previous commit caused issues with some applications and scripts, breaking existing systems.

The patch sets the sysctl variables `sysctl_protected_symlinks` and `sysctl_protected_hardlinks` to 0, effectively disabling the link protections by default.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it addresses a regression introduced by a previous change that broke some applications.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for an issue related to unnecessary work and excessive reporting of info messages from the `->add_disk` function in the `md_check_recovery` function of the `md.c` file in the `drivers/md` directory.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: No, it does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization and bug prevention rather than fixing a critical issue.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: Yes, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking bug in the SELinux/NetLabel glue code. The bug causes a suspicious RCU usage error, which can lead to system instability. This bug can be considered a critical issue as it can potentially cause hangs or data corruption.

The patch itself converts the bottom half socket lock to a more conventional and correct lock_sock() call. This change should address the locking bug and prevent the error from occurring.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that the patch fixes the issue without introducing any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a memory leak in the query device function of the mlx5 driver for InfiniBand.
2. The fix involves freeing the dev->port when RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) cannot be enabled or when node data initialization fails.
3. The patch is associated with the commit "0837e86a7a34" which added per port counters.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Mellanox and reviewed by Mark Bloch.
5. The patch modifies the mlx5_ib_add function in the main.c file of the mlx5 driver.
6. In the mlx5_ib_add function, if RoCE is not enabled or node data initialization fails, the code jumps to the "err_free_port" label instead of "err_dealloc" as before.
7. The "err_free_port" label is responsible for freeing the dev->port.
8. The patch also initializes mutexes and creates device resources.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to memory leak and ensures proper cleanup when RoCE cannot be enabled or node data initialization fails. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to the number of offload queue sets in the cxgb4 driver. The patch limits the number of offload queue sets to prevent a driver crash on machines with more cores than the maximum allowed offload queue sets.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a driver crash. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch tablet (056a:00d0) in the HID wacom driver. The issue is that the device is being removed before the mode setting can be executed, causing a problem with the ghost pen interface.

The patch cancels the delayed work and calls the `_wacom_query_tablet_data()` function to set the mode on the ghost pen interface before removing it. This ensures that the mode setting is executed properly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific issue with the Bamboo Touch tablet.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing spinlock initialization in the aq_ring structure in the Aquantia Ethernet driver. This initialization is necessary to ensure proper synchronization and prevent potential race conditions.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or hangs, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (A) to accept this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can cause GPU hangs. The patch disables the RHWO (Render Hang Workaround Optimization) in the GEN7_COMMON_SLICE_CHICKEN1 register, as recommended in the BSpec Workarounds page.

The patch also includes references to two Bugzilla entries, indicating that the bug has been reported and tracked. Additionally, it includes a Tested-by tag from Eugeni Dodonov, suggesting that the patch has been successfully tested.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can cause GPU hangs, and it does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a build error, as indicated by the reported BUG message and the slab-out-of-bounds error.
2. The bug is reproducible on the Rockchip platform rk3368 SoC, which supports USB 2.0 and uses functionfs for ADB.
3. The bug is triggered when the kernel is built with CONFIG_KASAN=y and CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y, indicating that it affects kernel configurations commonly used for debugging and security.
4. The patch fixes the out-of-bounds access issue by checking if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. This ensures that the descriptor is only accessed when necessary.
5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering these factors, the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and is not a trivial fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the get_fmt callback function in the m5mols driver. The patch corrects an inverted check of the return value from __find_format().

Since this patch only addresses a typo and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. This BUG_ON statement was causing a regression in the Linux kernel version 3.5, resulting in a kernel crash.

The patch is removing the BUG_ON statement, which was intended to verify that no batches were submitted to the kernel while the UMS/GEM client was suspended. However, the checks performed by the BUG_ON statements are considered a crude approximation and are too late in the code execution to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state.

Considering that the BUG_ON statement is unnecessary and removing it does not introduce any new issues, it can be concluded that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). This is because it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a kernel crash, which qualifies as an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the Xen pciback driver and the resetting of pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called. The patch aims to avoid resetting pci_dev->irq and mentions that a proper fix will be prepared for the next merging window.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially cause issues with the Xen pciback driver, it can be considered for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases. However, further analysis is required to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.) and that it meets the necessary quality standards.

Therefore, I would recommend further review and testing of the patch before making a final decision on whether to accept it in the Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the md/raid5 module related to indexing beyond the end of the failed_num[] and fdev[] arrays. The patch limits the loops to a maximum of 2 iterations to prevent indexing beyond the array bounds.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria for acceptance. The patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the loop conditions and could have a significant impact on the behavior of the module.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The patch addresses a possible out-of-bounds access issue on non-DeviceTree (DT) platforms in the Samsung serial driver. This bug can potentially lead to memory corruption.

2. The bug can cause data corruption: The out-of-bounds access can result in memory corruption, which is a critical issue.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a recursive locking bug introduced in the imx_console_write() function, which can cause issues such as being stuck on the lock and being unable to determine the cause of a kernel crash.

2. The bug can lead to potential issues: The recursive locking bug can prevent printks from surfacing on the serial console, making it difficult to debug the system. Additionally, it can cause problems when the kernel crashes and needs to provide information about the crash.

3. The patch proposes a solution: The patch suggests avoiding locking in the sysrq case and using trylock in the oops_in_progress case. This approach is used in other drivers as well and can help prevent similar bugs in the future.

4. The patch addresses a broader issue: The patch highlights that many UP originated drivers miss these checks, and it would be beneficial to have a common place to handle such cases to avoid copy/paste/modify bugs.

5. The patch provides a tested-by and signed-off-by: The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander and signed-off by Thomas Gleixner and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone testing and review.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation introduces a race condition where accessing already freed memory can occur when the timer expires again.

2. The bug can potentially cause data corruption or other issues: Accessing freed memory can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes or data corruption.

3. The patch provides a fix for the bug: It suggests replacing the use of mod_timer with mod_timer_pending to prevent the race condition.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a significant issue rather than making trivial changes like spelling or whitespace corrections.

Considering these factors, it appears that this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a resource management issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver. The patch reinitializes descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume, instead of freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues during suspend/resume, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and provides a more efficient solution by preserving memory data.

Additionally, the patch has been tested on STi boxes and has been reported by ZhengShunQian with signed-off-by from Giuseppe Cavallaro and David S. Miller.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds support for passing probe requests and beacons from other access points (APs) in AP mode and GO mode in order to set the ht protection IE properly.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm in the TCP implementation. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause performance issues and longer HoL blocking. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented calling prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions when the framebuffer remains unchanged.
2. The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require calling prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical.
3. The patch suggests letting the driver decide when prepare_fb and cleanup_fb are noops, instead of handling all the special cases in the core.
4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to atomic drivers and allows the driver to handle prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions appropriately. It does not appear to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix a real and critical bug or issue.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Given that the patch is reverting a previous implementation and the reason provided for the revert is a race condition, it suggests that the previous implementation was causing issues. Additionally, the patch mentions the need to revisit how to properly support kexec within the DRM.

Based on this information, it appears that the patch is addressing a real and critical issue related to shutdown or driver unload time, which can potentially lead to hangs or other problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open.
2. It addresses a specific scenario where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.
3. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.
4. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to use the synack_stamp instead of tp->lsndtime to compute the SYNACK RTT.
5. It also adds a check to only update the RTT if synack_stamp is available and there are no total retransmissions.
6. Additionally, the patch introduces a condition to check if tp->srtt is not set, indicating that the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the (Fast Open'd) data packets sent in SYN_RECV. In this case, the smooth RTT computed in tcp_ack() is used as the SYNACK RTT.
7. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors and has been acknowledged by other individuals.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and improves the accuracy of the RTT measurement. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

5. Trivial Fixes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). While it addresses a specific issue, it does not fix a critical bug or a real security issue that would warrant inclusion in the stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The changes made in the patch are related to the handling of zero-sized mm in the Nouveau DRM driver. While the patch may improve code readability and maintainability by avoiding unnecessary checks, it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to NVMe-oF queue size causing a potential deadlock and resulting in an error message.
2. The patch changes the way signaling is done based on the queue depth, removing a magic define.
3. It introduces a new function `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit` to calculate the signaling limit based on the queue depth.
4. The patch modifies the condition for signaling completion to use the new function `nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit`.
5. The patch also mentions that the existing code snippet is copied from the iSER initiator and the magic number '32' is derived from there.
6. The patch ensures that flushes are always signaled and explains the reason behind it.
7. The patch includes appropriate Cc, Signed-off-by, and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to NVMe-oF queue size and improves the signaling mechanism. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the intended behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It modifies the scheduling behavior of the task, which could potentially address a real and critical bug or issue.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

4. The change is specific to the stmpe-ts.c file in the drivers/input/touchscreen directory, suggesting that it targets a specific functionality or driver.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug related to a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver. This bug was introduced by the commit 7d32cdef5356, which caused the core platform driver to correctly return an error code when failing to probe.

The patch adds a validation check for the musb pointer before calling the usb_phy_set_suspend function, preventing the NULL pointer dereference. This fix addresses a potential hang or system instability issue during system suspend.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause a hang or system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not getting out of idle when HDMI is enabled. The patch adds a temporary hack by calling `dss_runtime_get()` before `pm_runtime_get_sync()` to ensure the DSS clock domain is enabled.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause HDMI not to work when it's the default display. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to note that the patch author suggests that a correct fix should be implemented later by modifying the DSS related hwmod's mainclks and making changes in how optional clocks are handled in the DSS driver.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error in the s3c2410_udc driver. The error is caused by passing the address of a bit-field 'maxpacket' instead of its value to the 'usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit' function.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the build error and whether it qualifies as a critical bug.

Therefore, I would lean towards accepting this patch in a stable release (ACK), but it would be beneficial to gather more information about the impact of the build error and the potential risks associated with it before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch and the information given, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch fixes a specific crash that is caused by a general protection fault. The crash is described in detail, including the stack trace and the affected task.

3. The Fixes tag references a specific commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear indication of the bug being addressed.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and has been acknowledged by Tejun Heo. It has also been reviewed by Hannes Reinecke and Christoph Hellwig.

5. The patch modifies multiple files, including block/blk-cgroup.c, block/blk-core.c, block/blk-sysfs.c, and block/blk.h. This suggests that the fix is not trivial and likely addresses a real issue.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch fixes a critical bug related to a use-after-free issue and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt enable code in the cavium-octeon MMC driver. The patch description explains that on certain OCTEON SoCs with CIU3, there is no interrupt masking local to the MMC bus interface, and attempting to write to the enable register can cause interrupts to fire immediately, breaking the driver.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `octeon_mmc_int_enable` function to only write to the enable register if the `has_ciu3` flag is not set. This ensures that the register is not touched on SoCs where it can cause problems.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause issues with the driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a hang issue related to direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN. The patch ensures that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag is set and the i_aiodio_unwritten counter is increased simultaneously. This prevents the counter from going negative and causing processes to wait indefinitely.

The patch also includes additional defensive checks to ensure the flag is not already set before incrementing the counter. This is done in both the ext4_end_io_buffer_write() function in fs/ext4/inode.c and the io_submit_add_bh() function in fs/ext4/page-io.c.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to a lockdep warning in the IB/ipoib driver. The lockdep warning indicates a possible recursive locking scenario, which can lead to a deadlock. The patch proposes using `down_read_nested` instead of `down_read` to prevent the warning.

Considering that the lockdep warning indicates a potential issue that can cause a hang or deadlock, and the patch addresses this issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug that can cause a hang and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a NULL pointer dereference when read_tree_block() fails, leading to an oops and potential system instability.

2. The bug is not trivial: It is not a spelling change or whitespace cleanup, but rather a significant issue that can cause data corruption or system crashes.

3. The patch fixes the bug: It sets the tree_root->node to NULL when read_tree_block() fails, preventing the subsequent code from triggering the error.

4. The patch is signed-off by the relevant contributors: Zhao Lei and Chris Mason.

Given these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and improve system stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI-E transport "inta" race in the iwlwifi driver. The bug causes interrupts to be missed if the reset happens after some other interrupt reasons were already added to the variable. This bug could potentially lead to random command timeouts.

The patch itself addresses the issue by resetting the "trans_pcie->inta" variable after releasing the spinlock, ensuring that interrupts are not missed. The patch also includes a comment explaining the bug and how it was discovered.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to command timeouts and has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized memory access issue when writing to oprofilefs on the s390 architecture. The patch checks the return value of the oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() function and returns an error if it is less than or equal to zero.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sctp_diag module in the Linux kernel. The patch modifies the condition for skipping certain endpoints during dumping, based on the idiag_states flags.

The original condition checks if the idiag_states flags have any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN, and if the endpoint's asocs list is not empty. The patch modifies this condition to also include the TCPF_CLOSE flag in the check.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems to fix a bug related to the incorrect skipping of certain endpoints during dumping.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It appears to fix a real bug without introducing any new issues or trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the values of LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 in the poison.h header file. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is simply adjusting the values of poison pointers to be smaller for systems with small mmap_min_addr setups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that the previous fix accidentally changed the loop condition in too many places while fixing a real bug. This indicates that there was a genuine issue that needed to be addressed.

2. The patch correctly fixes the loop condition in the dual_emac mode section, where 'i' is used as an index into priv->slaves, which is a 0-based array. This fix is necessary to ensure correct behavior.

3. The other two changes, which are only used in switch mode, were incorrect in the previous fix. In switch mode, 'i' represents the ALE port number, where port 0 is the host port and ports 1 and up are the slave ports. The patch puts the loop condition back in the switch mode section, addressing the issue.

4. The patch includes comments to clearly explain the intent and avoid future confusion. Additionally, a comment that previously stated the opposite of what was happening has been fixed.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone review and approval.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug and addresses incorrect behavior in the switch mode section. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning generated by newer versions of GCC. The warning is related to a potential implicit fall-through in a switch statement.

The patch sets `socks.tsflags` to `sk->sk_tsflags` as the default value, which should resolve the problem.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause issues with system functionality, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PFMF instruction handler blindly writing the storage key even if the page is mapped read-only in the host. The patch suggests trying a copy-on-write (COW) operation before continuing and bailing out in case of errors.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or other problems. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change in question is a negation of the return value of `ti->type->iterate_devices()` function call. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` to clear the RWC (Read/Write Clear) bit in the PORTSC (Port Status and Control) register.

2. The function `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` checks if the RWC bit is set in the PORTSC register. If it is set, the function clears the RWC bit and updates the register.

3. The patch modifies the `xhci_bus_resume()` function in `xhci-hub.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC (Port Link Control) bit in the PORTSC register.

4. The patch also modifies the `handle_port_status()` function in `xhci-ring.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC bit in the PORTSC register.

5. The patch adds the declaration of the `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function in `xhci.h`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to clear the RWC and PLC bits in the PORTSC register. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the linear region size of a 39-bit VA kernel on arm64 architecture.

It appears to be more of an optimization or adjustment rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The wrong pointer is being passed for raw data sanity checking, leading to an invalid event and causing perf record to hang during processing build IDs.

2. The bug causes a hang, which is considered a critical issue.

3. The fix is straightforward and involves using the proper pointer to the raw data instead of the 'u' union.

4. The patch has been reviewed by multiple individuals, including David Ahern, who has provided a Reviewed-by tag.

5. The patch has been tested and verified by the submitter, Jiri Olsa, who has provided a Signed-off-by tag.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the USB gadget driver. The patch checks if dma_pool_alloc() fails and properly handles the failure by freeing the allocated bd_table before jumping to the fail label. This prevents a memory leak in case of allocation failure.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that can lead to resource leakage, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem: The kernel hangs during bootup on Little Endian (LE) operating systems when both IMA and VTPM are enabled.

2. Cause: The hang occurs because IMA calls `tpm_pcr_read()`, which triggers the execution of `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` and `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()`. It was observed that `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()` was hanging.

3. Resolution: The patch fixes the hang by addressing the issue in `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()`. The problem was caused by `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` sending a CRQ message that didn't make sense to phype (Power Hypervisor) due to Endianness. The patch ensures that the CRQ is correctly converted for Little Endian systems.

4. Testing: The patch has been tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in the kernel configuration on both Big Endian (BE) and Little Endian (LE) PowerPC64 LPARs. The testing covers the CRQ and TPM command code paths in the VTPM module.

5. Patch Details: The patch modifies the `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` function in `tpm_ibmvtpm.c` and the `struct ibmvtpm_crq` in `tpm_ibmvtpm.h`. It replaces the usage of `u64` with `__be64` for the `word` variable and uses appropriate conversion functions (`cpu_to_be16()`, `cpu_to_be32()`, `be64_to_cpu()`) for the `crq.len` and `crq.data` fields.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided testing, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference, which is an oops. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Description of the bug:
   The bug is described as follows: with TX VLAN offload enabled, the source MAC address for frames sent using the VLAN interface is currently set to the address of the real interface. This is incorrect because the VLAN interface may be configured with a different address.

2. Purpose of the patch:
   The patch aims to fix the bug introduced in commit 2205369a314e12fcec4781cc73ac9c08fc2b47de ("vlan: Fix header ops passthru when doing TX VLAN offload."). It sets the correct source address before calling the create function of the real interface.

3. Patch analysis:
   The patch modifies the function `vlan_passthru_hard_header` in the `vlan_dev.c` file. It adds a check to set the source address to `dev->dev_addr` if `saddr` is NULL. This ensures that the correct source MAC address is used when sending frames using the VLAN interface.

4. Evaluation:
   Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the incorrect source MAC address when using TX VLAN offload. It addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or incorrect network behavior. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

It also updates the `gennvm_unregister` function to call `gennvm_free` instead of manually freeing the memory.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential memory leak, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to overflow in msg-type 6 requests in the s390/zcrypt driver. It introduces additional checks to prevent overflow in the request and reply lengths.

The patch adds two overflow checks, one for the request length and another for the reply length. These checks ensure that the sum of the request control block length and data length is greater than or equal to the largest operand. Similarly, the sum of the reply control block length and data length is checked.

By performing these checks, the patch helps prevent potential buffer overflows and ensures the integrity of the data being processed by the driver.

Since the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "weak" attribute from the clocksource_default_clock() declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error check in the staging driver for the IIO accelerometer (sca3000). The patch checks for a negative return value from the function sca3000_read_ctrl_reg() instead of just checking for a non-zero value.

Since this patch addresses an error check and ensures proper handling of failure cases, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a regression introduced in commit 6e3f62f0793e. The patch aims to partially revert the mentioned commit to address the issue of platform-device name collisions in mfd-drivers.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization of the ulpi bus by replacing `module_init(ulpi_init)` with `subsys_initcall(ulpi_init)`. This change ensures that `ulpi_init` is executed during the subsys_initcall phase instead of the module_init phase.

2. The patch addresses a reported issue where the registration of the ulpi bus in module_init could cause unnecessary probe delays for ulpi drivers that depend on the ulpi bus.

3. The reported issue could lead to -EPROBE_DEFER errors for ulpi drivers if they are registered before the ulpi bus itself.

4. The patch is reported by Zhuo Qiuxu and signed-off by Lu Baolu. It is also acknowledged by Heikki Krogerus.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to the registration of the ulpi bus and can potentially prevent unnecessary probe delays for ulpi drivers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to memory leaks in the DRM subsystem. The patch addresses the issue of increasing reference counts for both dma-buf and gem, which leads to memory leaks and prevents the release function of dma-buf from being called.

The patch adds dma_buf_put() for imported gem objects that come from their own gem into each driver with prime_import and prime_export capabilities. This ensures that only the gem reference count is increased when importing a gem exported from the same driver.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific driver, the sunhme driver for Sun Happy Meal cards. The patch allows the driver to be loaded on SBus systems that are based upon SBI SBus Bridges.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch does not address any of the mentioned critical issues. It seems to be a specific enhancement to allow the driver to work on a particular type of SBus system. Therefore, this patch would not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The zram hot removal code calls idr_remove() even when zram_remove() returns an error, leading to a leftover device and eventually causing a crash when the module is reloaded. This bug can result in a system crash, which qualifies as a critical issue.

2. The bug is described in detail, including the steps to reproduce it and the resulting crash. This demonstrates that the bug has a significant impact on system stability.

3. The patch fixes the bug by adding proper error checking in hot_remove_store() to avoid calling idr_remove() unconditionally. This ensures that idr_remove() is only called when zram_remove() succeeds, preventing the leftover device and subsequent crash.

4. The patch includes relevant information such as the Fixes tag, Bugzilla link, and the Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from multiple contributors, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and improve system stability. Therefore, the decision is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to saving the state of list registers in the KVM subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. The patch ensures that the dirty list registers are properly cleared, preventing unexpected EOI interrupts from being left pending for virtual level interrupts.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the virtio console driver. It ensures that when a port is unplugged, all subsequent read operations return -ENODEV, indicating that the device is no longer available. This is important for proper error handling and preventing potential issues caused by reading from a disconnected device.

The patch also mentions that previously, even if a port was unplugged, subsequent read operations would return 0, which did not indicate that the device had gone away. This could lead to confusion for users who were not monitoring the SIGIO signal, as they would not have a chance to find out if the port went away.

The fix is straightforward and does not contain any trivial changes. It adds a check to return -ENODEV on all read operations if the port is unplugged. This behavior is already present in the write operation.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the non-trivial fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to GPU reset in the DRM/i915 driver. The bug causes interference with GPU initialization and may trigger a warning. The patch aims to disable RPS interrupts and flush related work items before resetting the GPU.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the Xen balloon driver. The bug occurs when highmem pages are requested from the balloon on a system without highmem. In such cases, the current implementation of `alloc_xenballooned_pages` will allocate all available memory in an attempt to find highmem pages to return. This can lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) situation.

The patch modifies the `alloc_xenballooned_pages` function to allow low memory to be returned when highmem pages are requested. This change prevents the loop caused by continuously allocating memory and resolves the OOM issue.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the critical bug.

Therefore, considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to preventing inner-reload while virtual functions (VFs) exist in the bnx2x driver. The bug caused the prevention of bnx2x_resume() from running, which was harmless but incorrect. The patch moves the check to the correct spot.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch is titled "IB/rxe: Fix kmem_cache leak" and it aims to fix a kmem_cache leak by decrementing the qp reference when handling an error path in the completer. The patch includes changes to the rxe_comp.c file.

Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch adds code to drop the reference to the qp and free the skb if pkt is not NULL. This is done in two places within the rxe_completer function.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we don't have information about the severity of the kmem_cache leak or its impact on the system.

Without further context or details, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, if the kmem_cache leak is a critical issue that meets the criteria mentioned earlier, and the patch has been reviewed and tested, it could be considered for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the decision for this patch would be (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier and has been reviewed and tested. Otherwise, it would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug in the Bluetooth RFCOMM code. It addresses an information leak issue caused by uninitialized kernel heap memory. The patch allocates memory using kzalloc() to ensure proper initialization.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to interrupt storm on resume in the pinctrl-cherryview driver. The issue is triggered by a BIOS bug that sets a GPIO pin to trigger on a high level, causing a flood of unhandled interrupts on resume from suspend (S3).

The patch addresses this issue by moving the suspend and resume hooks to be called at _noirq time, allowing the driver to restore the interrupt mask to a known state before enabling device interrupts. This prevents the interrupt storm from occurring.

Considering that the issue was fixed by upgrading the BIOS, but not everyone upgrades their BIOS, it is reasonable to include this patch in the stable release to provide a software-based fix for affected systems.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to a NULL-pointer dereference at open in the mos7840 USB-Serial driver. The patch adds a check for an interrupt-in endpoint and returns an error if it is missing.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Additionally, the added length check ensures that the packet is long enough to contain the TCP header, which further strengthens the patch's validity.
true || Based on the provided information, let's analyze the patch:

The patch is titled "ISDN: eicon: silence misleading array-bounds warning." It addresses a warning generated by some versions of GCC in the eicon driver code. The warning is related to an array subscript being above array bounds.

The patch modifies the code in the `mixer_notify_update` function in the `message.c` file of the eicon driver. It replaces the `PUT_WORD` macro with direct assignments to the `info.facility_req.structs` array elements.

The change ensures that the warning is avoided by open-coding the line causing the warning. The new code assigns the lower 8 bits of `LI_REQ_SILENT_UPDATE` to `structs[1]` and the upper 8 bits to `structs[2]`.

Based on the provided information, this patch seems to address a warning that is not critical and does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a trivial fix related to a warning message.

2. The patch is addressing a specific issue reported by Simon Kirby, which involves divides by zero errors in __tcp_select_window(). This indicates that there is a real and critical bug that needs to be fixed.

3. The bug occurs when inet_csk_route_child_sock() returns a NULL pointer, leading to freeing a new socket while the keepalive timer is still armed in tcp_create_openreq_child().

4. The proposed fix is to call tcp_clear_xmit_timers() before unlocking the socket and freeing it. This suggests that the patch is addressing the bug by properly clearing the transmit timers.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors and the Tested-by tag from Simon Kirby, indicating that the fix has been reviewed and tested.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to divides by zero errors and ensures that the transmit timers are properly cleared before freeing the socket.

The issue occurs when booting with Device Tree Blob (DTB) because the platform data for the haptic device is not set in the supplied data from the parent MFD device. This results in a kernel Oops and a NULL pointer dereference.

The patch checks if the platform data is available and assigns it to the haptic_pdata variable. If the platform data is not available, an error message is printed, and the function returns with an error code.

Considering the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference and a kernel Oops, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be removing a broken attempt at GPU reset using genpd. The patch also mentions that it caused build breakage due to using CONFIG_PM_SLEEP functions without the corresponding Kconfig dependency.

Since the patch is removing a broken and non-functional code, it does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could cause a NULL pointer dereference in the `tipc_nl_publ_dump()` function. The patch checks if the socket for which the user is listing publication exists before parsing the socket netlink attributes.

2. Offending Commit: The patch mentions the offending commit as "6e94119," which is related to returning consistent error codes in ecc.correct() implementations.

3. Problem Description: The problem mentioned in the patch is that the new error code introduced in the commit is not being handled properly in double bit error detection.

4. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the return statement in the double_bit_error_detect() function in mtd_nandecctest.c. It changes the condition from `(ret == -1)` to `(ret == -EBADMSG)`, and if true, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns -EINVAL.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a regression introduced in the mtd_nandectest code by properly handling the new error code in double bit error detection. It addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple addition of support for a new device (MSI Windpad 110W) in the HID multitouch driver. This patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. As a result, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash caused by calling `brightness_set` manually in the `usbport_trig_update_count` function. The patch replaces the manual call with the `led_set_brightness` helper function, which handles fallback to `brightness_set_blocking` if necessary.

The crash is indicated by the "Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference" error and the subsequent backtrace. The patch addresses this issue by using the proper LED API.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential crash, it falls under the category of fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can cause a crash and backtrace. The patch moves the irqdomain initialization to a point where the spinlock and GPIO chip are fully populated, allowing the callbacks to be used without crashes.

Given that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a bug in the cifs_iovec_write function. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description explains that the recent update to the cifs_iovec_write code broke the handling of the file position.
   - This indicates that there was a bug introduced in the code.

2. The patch fixes the issue by moving the initialization of the "offset" variable after the generic_write_checks function call.
   - This suggests that the original offset value was being copied incorrectly, and the fix ensures it is copied at the correct point.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by lines, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real bug that affects the functionality of the cifs_iovec_write function. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, such as a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: "nfc: fdp: fix NULL pointer dereference"
   This indicates that the patch aims to fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in the nfc/fdp driver.

2. Code changes:
   - The patch adds a check for the "phy" pointer before dereferencing it.
   - If "phy" is NULL, a debug message is printed to provide a stack trace for debugging purposes.
   - The "client" variable is assigned the value of "phy->i2c_dev" after the NULL check.
   - The debug message is moved after the NULL check.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference issue by adding a check for the "phy" pointer before accessing its members. This is a valid fix for preventing crashes or other issues caused by dereferencing a NULL pointer.

4. Impact:
   The issue being fixed is a potential NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior. This qualifies as a real and critical bug that can cause issues like oops or hangs.

5. Trivial changes:
   The patch does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch title: "drm/amdgpu: clear SA bo when created"
   - The patch appears to address a specific issue related to the SDMA ring hang issue.

2. Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by:
   - The patch has been signed-off-by Monk Liu, Alex Deucher, and reviewed by Alex Deucher and Christian König, all from AMD.

3. Code changes:
   - The patch modifies the function `amdgpu_sa_bo_manager_start` in the file `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_sa.c`.
   - Line 115: A call to `memset` is added to clear the memory pointed to by `sa_manager->cpu_ptr` with zeros.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the SDMA ring hang and clears the memory when the SA bo is created. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, and it could potentially prevent hangs and improve stability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition between `scsi_error_handler` and `scsi_host_dev_release`, which can result in a hang when the device goes away.
2. The race condition is described clearly, and the proposed solution of inverting the ordering of `set_current_state` and `kthread_should_stop` seems straightforward and reasonable.
3. The issue has been noticed during reboot testing on a 3.0 based kernel, but it is mentioned that the current code is also affected in the same way.
4. The patch has been reviewed by multiple individuals and has received their sign-offs.
5. The patch includes a Cc to the stable mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current timeout value of 10ms for halting the controller after clearing the run/stop bit is causing the kernel to abort the suspend. This can lead to system instability or data corruption.

2. The patch increases the timeout to the recommended value of 16ms, as specified in the Intel XHCI specification. This ensures that the controller has enough time to halt properly before the suspend process continues.

3. The patch has a clear justification for the change, stating that a device has been observed to take 14ms to halt, which exceeds the current timeout.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the changes.

5. The patch is targeted for backporting to older kernels (as old as 2.6.37) that contain the relevant commit for PCI power management implementation in xHCI.

6. The patch modifies the xhci_suspend function in the xhci.c file, specifically changing the timeout value from 100*100 (10ms) to XHCI_MAX_HALT_USEC (16ms).

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to hash faults for kernel regions in the powerpc/spufs code. The bug was introduced in commit ac29c64089b7, which replaced _PAGE_USER with _PAGE_PRIVILEGED and denied kernel access to non-_PAGE_PRIVILEGED pages. However, this change was not applied to the hash fault handler for spufs' kernel accesses, causing issues with DMAs required to establish SPE memory.

The patch adds _PAGE_PRIVILEGED to the hash fault handler for kernel accesses, addressing the bug. It includes the necessary Fixes tag and has been reviewed by relevant individuals.

Considering the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues with DMA and memory access, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes an error in the pch_phub driver where the error return value is not properly initialized when pci_map_rom fails and no ROM can be mapped. The patch sets the return value to -ENODATA in this case, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: "ksm: fix m68k build: only NUMA needs pfn_to_nid"
   - The patch aims to fix a build error specific to the m68k architecture when the CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM configuration is enabled.

2. Description:
   - The error occurs in the mm/ksm.c file at line 492, where the function `pfn_to_nid` is implicitly declared.
   - The error is due to the expectation that the arch's asm/mmzone.h file should declare `pfn_to_nid` for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM, similar to how it is declared for CONFIG_SPARSEMEM and CONFIG_FLATMEM.
   - The patch suggests that the declaration of `pfn_to_nid` is only expected when CONFIG_NUMA is enabled.
   - The patch fixes the build error by replacing `pfn_to_nid(kpfn)` with `NUMA(pfn_to_nid(kpfn))` in the `get_kpfn_nid` function.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific build error on the m68k architecture caused by the missing declaration of `pfn_to_nid` for CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM.
   - It does not fix any critical bug, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.
   - The fix is specific to the m68k architecture and does not affect other architectures.
   - The change itself is not trivial, as it modifies the code logic in the `get_kpfn_nid` function.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address a real issue that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the decision is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the USB module order in the mackerel board. While it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does address a potential confusion for users regarding the USB port roles.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fall into the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue. It does not seem to be a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch is titled "rt2x00: fix rfkill regression on rt2500pci" and it addresses a bug reported by Niels regarding a regression in rfkill on the rt2500pci device. The bug was introduced by commit e2bc7c5, which caused rfkill to break on the rt2500pci device during device probe.

The patch attempts to fix the regression by reverting to the old behavior on the rt2500pci device. Additionally, it also addresses another issue introduced by the same commit, which is unregistering rfkill on device removal instead of ifconfig down.

The patch includes a link to the bug report for more details and has been tested and reported by Niels. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a regression in rfkill functionality on the rt2500pci device. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

It also mentions the specific impact on the s2c_hwmon driver and the potential for unpredictable effects.

4. The patch provides a solution: By checking the divisor variable type, the patch ensures that the correct operation is performed and fixes the issue for DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(0, 2U). It also marks the case of negative dividends divided by unsigned divisors as unsupported, indicating that it cannot be fixed in this patch.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs and credits: It has been reviewed, tested, and signed-off by multiple individuals, including the original reporter, Guenter Roeck, and Linus Torvalds.

Considering these factors, the patch addresses a critical bug, provides a solution, and has undergone proper review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its contents and evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to mailbox completion handling during a spurious interrupt in the qlcnic driver. It fixes a bug where a spurious interrupt is mistaken as a good mailbox completion interrupt, leading to premature completion of the next mailbox request.

The patch introduces a guard mechanism to check the current state of mailbox processing and ignore the spurious interrupt. Additionally, it adds a stats counter to record occurrences of this condition.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria for inclusion.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the devfreq_add_device() function, which is responsible for adding a devfreq instance.
2. The bug occurs when the find_devfreq_governor() function returns an error, causing devfreq_add_device() to fail in adding the devfreq instance.
3. The patch handles the error case by printing an error message and returning the error code.
4. The patch then sets the devfreq->governor to the returned governor and continues with the event_handler() call.
5. If the event_handler() call fails, an error message is printed.

Based on the analysis, the patch fixes a real bug that could cause the devfreq_add_device() function to fail, which can lead to issues with devfreq management. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) on SandyBridge due to performance issues and frequent lockups. The patch checks the generation of the Intel graphics device and disables FBC if the generation is less than or equal to 6.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch addresses a performance issue and frequent lockups caused by enabling FBC on SandyBridge. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a security issue, the performance degradation and lockups can be considered as "oh, that's not good" issues.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical issue that affects the functionality and stability of the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the L2TPv2 protocol in the Linux kernel. The bug was introduced in commit e0d4435f and caused issues with the PPPOL2TP_SO_SENDSEQ setsockopt. The patch addresses this issue by updating the hdr_len session field whenever sequencing is activated or deactivated from userspace.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect data transmission in L2TPv2. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The PFC driver for R8A7791 was based on preliminary revisions of the user's manual, which omitted the HSCIF1 group E signals in the IPSR4 register description. This caused HSCIF1's probe to fail with error messages.

2. The bug can cause a build error: The error messages indicate that the HSCIF1 probe fails, which can lead to a build error.

3. The bug can cause a "oh, that's not good" issue: The error messages indicate that the HSCIF1 probe fails, which can result in unexpected behavior or functionality issues.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch adds the necessary PINMUX_IPSR_MSEL() invocations for the HSCK1_E, HCTS1#_E, and HRTS1#_E signals, which are missing in the original code. This is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical issue related to the GIC/GICv3 interrupt controller on ARM-based systems. The patch ensures that all interrupts are deactivated and disabled at boot time to guarantee a clean state.

This patch addresses a potential problem where the firmware or a previous kernel may have left some interrupts active, leading to unpredictable behavior. By clearing the active bits and disabling all SPIs (Shared Peripheral Interrupts), the patch ensures a clean and reliable initialization of the interrupt controller.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause unexpected behavior or system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug causes PHY interrupts to be overwritten by 0, resulting in unpredictable behavior depending on the PHY's location on the MDIO bus. This can lead to issues such as data corruption or system instability.

2. The patch removes a memcpy operation: The memcpy operation was overwriting the PHY interrupts with a value of 0, disabling PHY_POLL and causing the issue mentioned above. Removing this operation ensures that the SMSC911x PHYs are always in polling mode.

3. The patch removes an unused member: The phy_irq member is no longer needed after removing the memcpy operation. Removing unused code improves code cleanliness and maintainability.

4. The patch includes relevant information: The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the bug. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to address a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to lockups caused by iput() calls in the Btrfs file system. The patch replaces the iput() calls with btrfs_add_delayed_iput() to delay the iputs and prevent potential lockups.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue that may lead to lockups, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue. However, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only changes the allocation size of the `chip->buffer` variable in the `gpio-74x164` driver. Since this change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The driver incorrectly uses a max TID count of 9 instead of the correct value of 8. This bug can cause a kernel BUG and a system crash, as reported by Nikolay Martynov.

2. The bug fix is critical: The bug can lead to a kernel BUG and system instability, which qualifies as a critical issue.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a genuine bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers: Johannes Berg and Wey-Yi Guy, both from Intel, have reviewed and signed-off on the patch, indicating that it has been thoroughly reviewed and tested.

5. The patch has been reported to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list: This suggests that the patch is suitable for inclusion in stable releases, as it has been deemed important enough to be backported to older, stable versions of the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug: The patch addresses an issue where several drivers don't define a value for bypass_val_on, resulting in incorrect reporting of bypass being enabled when it is not. This bug can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially impact system stability.

2. The bug fix is critical: The incorrect reporting of bypass being enabled when it is not can cause confusion and may lead to incorrect system behavior. It is important to ensure accurate reporting of bypass status for proper system operation.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not involve trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a real and critical bug.

4. The patch is well-documented: The patch includes a clear description of the bug it fixes and references the commit that introduced the issue.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch simplifies the netlink message length assignment by using the precalculated size instead of subtracting and adding the netlink header length.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (simplifying code without addressing any real issue), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "iio: adc: at91: don't use the last converted data register." It addresses an issue where the last converted data register can contain touchscreen relative values if a conversion is requested on another channel while the touchscreen mode is enabled. This can lead to incorrect data being read from the register.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the at91_adc_read_raw() function in the at91_adc.c file. It introduces a new variable "chnb" to store the channel number and uses it to read the channel data register instead of the last converted data register.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch aims to prevent incorrect data from being read from the last converted data register when touchscreen mode is enabled. It ensures that the conversion value is taken from the channel data register instead. This fix addresses a potential data corruption issue.

4. Patch Size and Complexity:
   The patch is relatively small and focused. It introduces a new variable and modifies a few lines of code within the at91_adc_read_raw() function.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to data corruption and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the backref code in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch addresses a problem where nodes were being checked along with leaves when populating extent item entries, which could lead to unexpected issues. 

The patch modifies the code to only perform the check on extent item positions when certain conditions are met, specifically when `ref->inode_list` is not present and `ref->level` is 0. This change ensures that the check is only performed when necessary and avoids potential problems.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` is being removed from the code. The patch states that there is nothing to prevent another thread from dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call to `nfs4_ds_disconnect()`, which could result in a NULL pointer dereference and potentially cause an Oops.

The patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid the issue with the device ID instead. It seems that the intention is to prevent the potential NULL pointer dereference by removing the `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` function.

Given this information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a potential issue that could lead to an Oops.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to running the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver.

2. The current behavior of calling dev_close() in the offline self-test causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes interface routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent with bringing down the interface before the test.

3. The proposed solution is to call the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(), avoiding the clearing of IFF_UP.

4. The patch includes changes in the ixgbe.h, ixgbe_ethtool.c, and ixgbe_main.c files.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to the offline self-test behavior in the ixgbe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference, leading to an oops and system crash. This qualifies as a real and critical bug.

2. The bug was introduced in commit 0a6b76dd23fa, which made the workingset shadow nodes shrinker memcg aware. The implementation in that commit was incorrect, leading to the bug.

3. The patch correctly addresses the issue by checking the sc->memcg variable instead of using memcg_kmem_enabled(). This change ensures that only memcg-aware shrinkers receive non-NULL memcgs when memcg_kmem_enabled is true.

4. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag, providing a reference to the commit that introduced the bug.

5. The patch has been tested and reported by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki, who experienced the bug and confirmed that the patch resolves it.

6. The patch has received acknowledgments from Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

7. The patch has been signed-off by Michal Hocko, the author of the patch, and Andrew Morton, the maintainer of the -stable branch.

Considering all these factors, it seems appropriate to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch increases the maximum number of properties in the DRM subsystem from 16 to 24. The reason for this change is to address a situation where on i915 machines with many TV connectors, the maximum number of properties is reached, resulting in backtraces in the logs.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is more of an optimization to prevent log spamming.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to revert a deprecation warning message related to SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. The reasons for reverting the message are outlined in the patch description:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and cannot be changed, making the deprecation warning unnecessary.
2) Applications using SCTP need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support to ensure compatibility with older and newer kernels.
3) Some applications, especially those with proprietary legacy components, may not have the ability to change and will be affected by the warning.

The patch author argues that the warning provides little benefit, especially considering the points mentioned above.

Based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases. It does not introduce any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue with the deprecation warning that may cause unnecessary noise and confusion for SCTP users.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the release of the mcc/mbox lock in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function in the be_cmds.c file of the be2net driver. The patch ensures that the lock is released in case be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to the release of a lock, which can potentially lead to issues like hangs or data corruption.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the bug can potentially cause hangs or data corruption, making it a critical issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on addressing the bug.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an off-by-two bug in the "perf hists browser" tool. The bug causes misalignment in the normal output. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it is a trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the pinctrl driver for the Baytrail platform. The patch clears the BYT_DIRECT_IRQ_EN bit for pads using IO mode, which is necessary for the IO-based IRQ to be detected.

6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be included (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by commit 05cc5a39ddb7 in the bnx2x driver. The regression causes a null pointer dereference when loading the 8021q module on machines with 57710 or 57711 adapters. The patch adds a check for the specific chip type (chip_is_e1x) to correctly set the accept_any_vlan flag.

Given that this patch fixes a real bug that can cause a null pointer dereference, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the dwc3 gadget driver related to resizing transmit (TX) FIFOs. It modifies the loop in the dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() function to iterate only over valid IN endpoints based on the num_in_eps parameter. This change prevents potential NULL dereferences of dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the SCTP module. This bug can lead to a kernel panic and is triggered by a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet. The patch addresses the issue by checking for a NULL return value from the sctp_get_af_specific() function, which could occur in certain scenarios.

Considering that the bug can lead to a kernel panic and the patch fixes a real and critical issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to accessing ctl_table in the proc_sys_poll() function. The bug can cause issues when poll() is called in entries created by modules, specifically the hostname and domainname entries. The bug can be triggered if a user calls poll() in a file that doesn't support it.

The patch addresses this issue by protecting the code accessing ctl_table using grab_header() and sysctl_head_finish() functions. It grabs the header before accessing ctl_table and releases it afterward. This ensures that if an entry goes away while polling, ctl_table will still exist.

The bug was reported by Dave Jones and the patch is signed-off by Lucas De Marchi, Andrew Morton, and Eric W. Biederman. It also includes relevant Cc's and is marked for stable release.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to potential issues and data corruption.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to enable CPUID for Intel SHA extensions, which provides new instructions for accelerated computation of SHA-1 and SHA-256. It adds the X86_FEATURE_SHA_NI definition to the cpufeature.h file.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for a new CPU feature.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the error message in the l2c310_of_parse() function in the ARM architecture. The patch changes the error message from "PL310 OF: cache setting yield illegal associativity" to "L2C-310 OF cache associativity %d invalid, only 8 or 16 permitted". 

Since this patch only modifies the error message and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to setting the IRQ thread policy without checking CAP_SYS_NICE. The patch uses sched_setscheduler_nocheck() to omit the CAP_SYS_NICE check, which is required for the SCHED_OTHER policy.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria for acceptance. The patch does not explicitly mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. However, it does address a potential issue where the IRQ thread may not run with the SCHED_OTHER policy if the user does not have CAP_SYS_NICE.

Considering the criteria for acceptance, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

5. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the issue.
6. The patch is signed-off by Mickaël Salaün and Acked-by Kees Cook.
7. It is also CC'd to several relevant individuals.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to syscall number updates in the um/ptrace code. It addresses failing tests and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the dma_mmap() function in the ARM IOMMU-based dma-mapping implementation. The patch adds a missing range check for mmap parameters, specifically the offset and buffer size, to prevent access beyond the allocated buffer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or access beyond allocated memory. Therefore, it qualifies as a fix for a real and critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix size updates for asynchronous I/O (AIO) writes in the NFS (Network File System) module. It addresses a specific issue where the inode size is not updated correctly when AIO writes are performed.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `nfs_direct_complete` function to include an additional parameter `write` which indicates whether the completion is for a write operation. If it is a write operation, the patch updates the inode size based on the position of the write. The `nfs_direct_complete` function is called from various places in the code, and the patch ensures that the correct value of `write` is passed.

3. Impact:
   The issue addressed by the patch does not seem to cause any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or correctness improvement rather than fixing a real and critical issue.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend a (B) NAK for this patch. It does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes significant issues or poses security risks.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The WRITE_SAME commands are not present in the blk_default_cmd_filter write_ok list, causing them to fail with -EPERM when the SG_IO ioctl() is executed without CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

2. The problem can be reproduced and observed with the sg_write_same command, which fails with "Operation not permitted" when executed by unprivileged users.

3. The patch adds the WRITE_SAME commands to the write_ok list, allowing the SG_IO ioctl to finish successfully.

4. The patch is reported to fix SCSI I/O errors observed in QEMU KVM guests with 'scsi-block' devices, which employ the SG_IO ioctl() and run as unprivileged users.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author, reviewers, and maintainers.

6. The patch includes relevant links to related commits and documentation for further reference.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and is not a trivial fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can cause a kernel panic. The bug occurs when the firewire-sbp2 module is removed before a login operation to a target completes, resulting in a null-pointer dereference and a kernel panic.

The patch addresses this issue by canceling pending work for each unit in the sbp2_remove() function, ensuring that there are no extra references preventing the module from unloading.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a kernel panic, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the incorrect re-injection of STP packets in the bridge module. This bug can potentially cause issues with the kernel's STP functionality. The patch addresses this by learning the packet's source MAC address and injecting it back into the Rx path for further processing.

Additionally, the patch ensures consistent behavior with regards to packets destined to the Bridge Group Address, regardless of whether STP is enabled or not.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493) that caused problems on GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link.

2. The patch is signed-off by Giuseppe Cavallaro <peppe.cavallaro@st.com> and has several Cc's.

3. In the stmmac_mdio_register function, the patch modifies the code to check for a compatible child node ("snps,dwmac-mdio") within the device's of_node. If found, it sets the mdio_node variable accordingly.

4. In the stmmac_probe_config_dt function, the patch removes the code that searches for a child node with the "snps,dwmac-mdio" compatible string and assigns it to the plat->mdio_node variable.

5. In the plat_stmmacenet_data structure definition in stmmac.h, the patch removes the mdio_node variable.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch reverts a commit that caused issues on specific boards when connected to a real transceiver. The changes made in the patch seem to address the issue by modifying the code related to mdio_node handling.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause connectivity issues on specific hardware configurations, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) cipher handle in the drbg_healthcheck_sanity() function. The patch also removes a call to drbg_generate() with an uninitialized DRBG, which was previously causing a build error.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

In this case, the patch is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG handle, which is an inappropriate use of the kernel crypto API. While it may not directly cause a build error or a security issue, it is considered a bug as it violates the proper usage of the API.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug that violates the proper usage of the kernel crypto API.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the PCI config address for DDW (Dynamic DMA Window) in the powerpc/pseries architecture. The patch modifies the calculation of the cfg_addr variable to match the expected format specified by the PAPR (Power Architecture Platform Reference) specification.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug related to PCI config address handling and follows the PAPR specification, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error on sparc64 caused by missing exported symbols in the mc13xxx-regulator-core.c file. The patch exports the symbols "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" to resolve the build failure.

Since the patch addresses a real bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a timeout error when setting configuration on the host side. The bug can be reproduced using any gadget with mass storage function. 

The patch itself adds a fix to clear the already_seen flag for ep0 separately, as it is not included in the ep_list inside the gadget structure. This fix is necessary to prevent a hang in the urb if the gadget driver delays setup handling.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair.
2. Previously, MTU probing initialization only occurred at connect() and SYN or SYN-ACK reception, but these scenarios did not cover repaired sockets.
3. As a result, if MTU probing was enabled and TCP_MAXSEG sockopt was not used before connect(), probing would be stuck at the tcp_base_mss value until tcp_probe_interval seconds have passed.
4. The patch adds the necessary MTU probing initialization when setting the MSS in a TCP repair.
5. It also includes the necessary reinitialization of MTU probing by calling tcp_mtup_init(sk).
6. The patch modifies the tcp_repair_options_est() function to take a generic sock pointer instead of a tcp_sock pointer.
7. The patch updates the function call to tcp_repair_options_est() in the do_tcp_setsockopt() function to pass the generic sock pointer instead of the tcp_sock pointer.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to MTU probing initialization in TCP repair. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to be critical enough to warrant inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes some variables from unsigned int to size_t. This change is made to support 64-bit arithmetic for very large files. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The udf_next_aext() function can potentially loop forever for a corrupted filesystem. This can lead to a hang or data corruption, which qualifies as a critical bug.

2. The patch introduces a limit on the number of indirect extents that can be followed in a row. This prevents the potential infinite loop and provides a safeguard against corrupted filesystems.

3. The patch includes a clear and concise changelog, which improves the documentation and readability of the code.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Vegard Nossum, Jan Kara, Quentin Casasnovas, and Andrew Morton. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the discard_granularity in the DM thin device. The patch updates the set_discard_limits() function to properly align discards sent to the DM thin device on a full block boundary, ensuring that each discard covers an entire DM thin-pool block and the block is reclaimed.

Since this patch addresses a real issue that can potentially lead to data corruption or loss, it can be considered critical. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The mvsas driver is causing a General Protection Fault when encountering an expander attached ATA device. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The analysis explains the root cause of the bug: The driver assumes all ATA devices are locally attached and obtains the phy mask by indexing the local phy table. However, expanders have more phys than the HBA, causing an index overflow and returning incorrect data.

3. The patch proposes a fix: It suggests mirroring the approach used in mvs_task_prep_ssp() for obtaining the phy mask using the port properties in mvs_task_prep_ata(). This fix should prevent the panic caused by the index overflow.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: It includes the reported-by and tested-by tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by Adam Talbot. It also includes the signed-off-by tag from James Bottomley, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the author.

5. The patch is submitted to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list: This indicates that the patch is intended for inclusion in the Linux -stable releases, which are focused on bug fixes and stability improvements.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be ACKed.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit and fixes shortcomings in the pci_restore_state() function. It ensures that the restoration of Base Address Registers (BARs) is retried only for Type 0 configuration headers, as opposed to treating all PCI devices as Type 0.

The patch modifies the pci_restore_config_space() function to include a new function, pci_restore_config_space_range(), which handles the restoration of BARs within a specified range. The pci_restore_config_space() function is then updated to call pci_restore_config_space_range() based on the header type of the PCI device.

The patch also includes a Tested-by tag, indicating that it has been tested by Mikko Vinni, and is signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki and Linus Torvalds.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of the pci_restore_state() function. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the restoration of BARs. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the programming of the CSMSADRCFG register in the ARM PXA3xx platform. It states that the register must be programmed to 0x2 for correct behavior of the Static Memory Controller.

2. The patch explains that without this fix, devices wired to DFI and accessed through SMC cannot be accessed after resuming from S2.

3. The patch explicitly mentions not relying on the bootloader to program the CSMSADRCFG register, indicating that the fix should be implemented in the kernel smemc module.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the smemc.c file to set the CSMSADRCFG register to 0x2 during resume.

5. The patch also includes a comment explaining the purpose of the CSMSADRCFG register and its bit definitions.

6. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Igor Grinberg and Eric Miao, and is also CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list.

Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the ARM PXA3xx platform, fixes a critical bug that can cause devices to be inaccessible after resume, and provides the necessary changes to set the CSMSADRCFG register to the correct value. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the restoration of UCB1x00 gpio output data on resume. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect GPIO output data after a resume. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior in the system. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, which is considered invalid according to the Software Developer's Manual (SDM). However, the code already supports exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0).

2. The patch aims to get back to real mode to prepare a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER. This process is more complicated if the vCPU supports long mode.

3. The patch checks if the vCPU supports long mode. If it does, it clears CR4.PCIDE before CR0.PG and sets up a 32-bit code segment to clear EFER.LMA.

4. For the 64-bit case, the patch clears EFER.LMA by clearing CR0.PG and CR0.PE.

5. The patch also clears CR4.PAE (before clearing EFER.LME) and finally goes back to 32-bit mode.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to exiting system management mode from 64-bit mode. It introduces necessary checks and modifications to ensure a safe state for loading CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER. Since it fixes a real and critical bug related to system management mode and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the madvise_free_huge_pmd function in the mm/huge_memory.c file. The patch ensures that the fallback PTE operations are correctly executed after splitting a transparent huge page (THP) if necessary.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific behavior in the code that could be improved but does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI versatile host bridge driver. The bug causes the PCI IO resource to be considered valid even if the kernel fails to map the PCI host bridge memory address driving IO cycles to the CPU virtual address space.

The patch addresses this issue by destroying the PCI host bridge PCI IO resources retrieved through firmware when the pci_remap_iospace() function call fails. This prevents the kernel from adding the respective PCI IO resource to the list of valid resources, thereby fixing the problem.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to incorrect resource assignment and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the handling of the last register block in the specified range. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of registers that should be synced, resulting in either syncing too few or too many registers.

The patch correctly adjusts the calculation formula to ensure the correct number of registers are synced. It updates the code by subtracting the number of the first register in the block from the max register number and adding one.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that can potentially lead to incorrect synchronization of registers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of vmalloc addresses in the powerpc specific nx-842 compression driver. The patch adds a routine to properly convert vmalloc addresses to physical addresses.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces structure assignments with timer API functions. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or performance improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only involves code cleanup and does not address any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses two issues in the dummy-hcd driver. The first issue is a NULL pointer dereference and a WARN_ON that can occur when unloading a gadget driver. The patch fixes this by checking if the driver argument is NULL before printing its name. This is a real bug that can cause issues and should be fixed.

The second issue is related to the removal of a sysfs attribute file attached to the gadget. The patch moves the removal before the UDC is deleted, which is the correct order of operations. This ensures that the attribute file is properly removed and avoids any potential issues.

Both of these issues are not trivial fixes and can potentially cause problems such as crashes or data corruption. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the data type of two variables from 'u32' to 'int'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any reported issues or provide any specific fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to transmission failure on a Sierra Wireless MC7710 device. The patch modifies the cdc_mbim_info structure by adding the FLAG_SEND_ZLP flag. 

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes transmission failure, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the change does not seem to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, my decision is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a regression in the pinctrl-abx500 driver related to the initialization of platform data and Device Tree (DT) probing. The current code fails to execute the DT probing code when DT is enabled, causing the driver to fail. 

The patch fixes this regression by modifying the probe() semantics to attempt to extract a platform ID from DT if it cannot be sourced from platform data. It also ensures that a pointer to GPIO platform data is always passed to the driver, eliminating the need to check for 'pdata' and execute the DT case if it's not present.

The patch also introduces changes to only use the DT match table if no platform ID is supplied through platform data. This change ensures that the correct platform is identified when booting with DT.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that can cause the driver to fail when DT is enabled. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the "mixer_wait_for_vblank" function.

2. It ensures that the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable is cleared by expecting the upcoming vsync interrupt handler routine to do so.

3. The patch enables and disables interrupts properly to ensure the expected behavior.

4. It calls "drm_vblank_get" to increment the vblank reference count.

5. It sets the "wait_vsync_event" atomic variable to 1.

6. It waits for the vsync event to occur, and if it times out, it prints a debug message.

7. Finally, it calls "drm_vblank_put" to decrement the vblank reference count.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a functional improvement or optimization rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to dropping the voltage to Vmin when the Gfx is power gated for the latest VLV revision. The patch drops a workaround that is no longer needed for the latest VLV revision and instead requests the minimum frequency to bring the voltage Vnn.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug related to power gating and voltage control, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a critical bug related to data corruption. The patch ensures that the timestamp is set as the last element in the channel specification, which is necessary for correct interpretation of the data by userspace code reading the buffer via sysfs.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it is safer to turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator since the driver will turn off the regcache_cache_only after enabling the regulator. This suggests that there might be an issue if cache_only is not turned on before disabling the regulator.

2. The patch mentions that if cache_only is not turned on, some commands like 'amixer cset' would fail if run before wm8962_resume(). This indicates that there might be a bug or issue related to the cache_only setting.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch adds the line "regcache_cache_only(wm8962->regmap, true);" before the call to "regulator_bulk_disable()". This sets the cache_only flag to true before disabling the regulator.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses a potential issue related to the cache_only flag and ensures that it is set correctly before disabling the regulator. This fix does not appear to be a trivial change, as it addresses a specific bug or issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of "-1" with "EXIT_FAILURE" in the exit() calls. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a general protection fault (GPF) in the `flush_to_ldisc()` function. The previous commit already addressed the issue for line disciplines that do not define a `receive_buf()` method. However, this patch aims to fix the same problem in the `tty_ldisc_receive_buf()` function, which is used by the vt driver and speakup driver to push selection data directly to the line discipline's `receive_buf()` method.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a GPF. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a bug in the ocfs2_file_aio_write() function in the ocfs2 file system. The bug occurs when ocfs2_inode_lock() fails, causing the function to skip unlocking the rw lock, which can lead to issues in ocfs2_lock_res_free().

Considering that this bug can potentially cause data corruption or other critical issues, it appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) L2 header check. It is reported that the current implementation of the L2 header check is only suitable for Ethernet traffic and fails on InfiniBand (IB)/ipoib traffic.

The patch proposes a more generic approach by considering the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes. This change allows GRO to handle different types of network traffic correctly.

The patch includes a conditional check based on the value of maclen (hard_header_len) to determine the appropriate comparison method. If maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length), it uses an optimized inline function to compare the Ethernet headers. Otherwise, it falls back to using memcmp to compare the headers.

The patch also includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, tested, and reviewed the issue.

Overall, the patch addresses a critical bug and improves the generic handling of L2 headers in GRO. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the recommendation is to accept the patch (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a mis-merge in gmap handling for the s390 architecture in the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that some changes were dropped during a previous merge, which caused KVM to fail for certain memory sizes, specifically 2GB.

The patch itself modifies the gmap_map_segment() function in the gmap.c file. It updates the condition for checking the validity of the memory range by subtracting 1 from the calculated end address. This change ensures that the memory range does not exceed the maximum allowed size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could cause KVM to fail for specific memory sizes. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The ATPX method may not always exist on the dGPU and could be located at the iGPU instead. This can cause conflicts with port PM and prevent the dGPU from powering on.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug. This indicates that it is addressing a known issue.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-and-tested-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by a user.

4. The patch includes "Signed-off-by" tags from multiple developers, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the patch.

5. The patch modifies the code to correctly handle the bridge power management (bridge_d3) based on the parent device of the iGPU.

6. The patch also adds a check for d3_supported, which is set based on the bridge_d3 status of the parent device. This ensures that the bridge power management is usable when necessary.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug that can cause issues with power management and prevents the dGPU from powering on. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is a revert of a previous commit that caused booting issues on a custom AT91RM9200 board. Reverting the commit allows the board to boot again, indicating that the original commit introduced a bug.

2. The debugging information reveals that the ioremap function is incorrectly determining that the SRAM mapping fits the requested mapping, leading to incorrect behavior.

3. The original premise of the "fix" patch was also found to be wrong. The condition checking the boundaries of the requested and existing mappings did not take the in-page offset into consideration, which caused obscure and hard-to-debug problems.

4. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Nicolas Pitre, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

Based on these points, it can be concluded that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that caused booting issues on a specific board. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a clear issue in the code. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make dropped packets consume the NAPI budget in the octeon-ethernet staging driver. This is done to ensure that the NAPI handler does not run for an extended period.

2. Patch Changes: The patch adds a single line of code to increment the `rx_count` variable when packets are dropped. It also removes the increment of `rx_count` in a specific condition where packets are dropped.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - It does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.
   - The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they modify the behavior of dropped packets in the NAPI handler.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-trivial fix that improves the behavior of the octeon-ethernet staging driver. However, it does not address any critical bug or issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential lost wakeup scenario in the staging driver "quatech_usb2" when using the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl. The patch addresses a race condition between the qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status.

The patch modifies the code by adding a barrier, setting the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, and checking for changes in the modem status. If there is no change, it returns an error (-EIO), and if there is a change in the requested modem status, it returns success (0).

Considering the patch addresses a potential issue that could result in a lost wakeup scenario, it can be categorized as fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch improves PM runtime and phy handling for the 2430 glue layer in the USB MUSB driver.
2. It simplifies things and allows idling both MUSB and PHY when nothing is configured.
3. The patch returns early from PM runtime if MUSB is not yet initialized.
4. It adds a warning if PHY is not configured.
5. It initializes the PHY in the omap2430_musb_init() function.
6. It removes the redundant phy_init() and phy_power_on() calls in the omap2430_musb_init() function.
7. It adds a check for musb->phy before calling phy_power_on() in the omap2430_musb_enable() function.
8. It adds a check for musb->phy before calling phy_power_off() in the omap2430_musb_disable() function.
9. It removes the redundant phy_power_off() call in the omap2430_musb_exit() function.
10. It sets musb->phy to NULL and cancels the omap_musb_mailbox_work in the omap2430_musb_exit() function.
11. It removes the cancel_work_sync() call for omap_musb_mailbox_work in the omap2430_remove() function.
12. It removes the redundant check for musb in the omap2430_runtime_suspend() function.
13. It removes the return -EPROBE_DEFER in the omap2430_runtime_resume() function.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to improve the PM runtime and phy handling for the 2430 glue layer in the USB MUSB driver. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VCE ring test on Big-Endian systems. The patch ensures that every write to the ring is translated to little-endian. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as build errors, hangs, or data corruption. It also addresses a specific issue related to Big-Endian systems, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

Furthermore, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on the critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called get_random_long() to provide a source of randomness that operates the same as get_random_int() but returns an unsigned long value. This addition is necessary to support systems that require more than 32 bits of randomness.

2. The shifting constant in mmap_rnd() is fixed to be an unsigned long, ensuring that values greater than 31 bits generate an appropriate mask without overflow. This is important for x86 systems, as values over 31 would otherwise disable mmap_base randomization.

3. Calls to get_random_int() are replaced with get_random_long() where appropriate, ensuring consistent usage of the new function.

Overall, this patch addresses a real issue related to randomness generation and ensures proper functionality on systems that require more than 32 bits of randomness. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to calling xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice on a V4 superblock, which leads to setting both pquotino and gquotino to NULLFSINO. This behavior is not desirable and can cause issues.

2. The patch fixes the issue by making it safe to call xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice and removes the extra calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk.

3. The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the sb_from_disk change occurred after V5 became the default. Therefore, this issue is specific to V4 superblocks.

4. The patch has been reported by Eryu Guan and reviewed by Carlos Maiolino, providing additional validation.

5. The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and reviewers, indicating their agreement with the changes.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the irq_domain_add() function. The current sanity check in the function tests whether desc->irq_data is not NULL or irq_data->domain is not NULL. This check prevents adding an irq_domain to an irq descriptor when irq_data exists, which is true when the irq descriptor already exists.

However, the check for irq_data == NULL is not separated, which can lead to confusion and potential issues. The patch splits the check for irq_data == NULL and adds a separate warning for it.

The patch also includes proper attribution and references to related individuals and mailing lists.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential bug and improves code clarity. It meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release as it addresses a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a temporary fix for an infinite loop issue in the Exynos DRM driver when using a multi-platform kernel. The patch checks if the machine is compatible with certain Exynos SoC models and only registers the Exynos DRM device object if it is. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a workaround for a specific scenario rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two audio-related bugs in the hdpvr driver. The first bug causes the audio input to be changed inadvertently when the audio encoding is changed. The second bug affects the handling of the default_audio_input module option, preventing the audio encoding from being switched to AC3 when default_audio_input is set to 2 (SPDIF input). Additionally, a trivial typo is fixed.

Considering the nature of the bugs and the fact that they can lead to incorrect audio input and incorrect handling of the default_audio_input option, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The bugs can potentially cause issues such as incorrect audio output or unexpected behavior for users of the hdpvr driver.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the trace_marker file adds the trace mark to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `tracing_mark_write` function in the `kernel/trace/trace.c` file. It introduces a new variable `tr` of type `struct trace_array` to hold the instance's buffer. The `buffer` variable is then updated to use `tr->trace_buffer.buffer` instead of `global_trace.trace_buffer.buffer`.

3. Analysis: The patch addresses a specific issue where the trace mark is incorrectly added to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer. This issue can potentially lead to incorrect tracing information and affect the accuracy of trace analysis.

4. Impact: The issue fixed by this patch does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it can lead to incorrect tracing information.

5. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. While it does not fix a critical bug, it addresses an issue that can impact the accuracy of trace analysis. However, the final decision ultimately rests with the maintainers and the stability criteria they have set for -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch avoids a duplicate call to `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` for `ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE` within `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. This duplication is unnecessary since it already occurs once during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation.

2. The patch removes the local `conn->stat_sn` assignment and increment, indicating that this should be handled by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

3. The third parameter of `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` is changed to signal that the assignment and increment of `cmd->stat_sn` should be done by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

4. The patch includes a `Tested-by` tag indicating that it has been tested by Moussa Ba.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to duplicate calls and unnecessary assignments. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement for the render backends in the DRM Radeon driver. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to releasing the controller's lock during gadget resume in the USB DWC3 driver. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption. 

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the `of_get_display_timings()` function in the `drivers/video/of_display_timing.c` file. The patch adds a `kfree(dt)` statement to free the memory allocated for `dt` in case `of_parse_display_timing()` fails.

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is a revert of a previous commit that claimed throughput improvement for MSC/UVC but did not show significant improvement in measurements. Additionally, the commit introduced two regressions:

1. The ASIX usb-ethernet dongle is completely broken on UDP RX.
2. Unplugging a 3G modem behind a hub causes console log flooding with an error message.

Since the patch reverts the commit that introduced these regressions, it is likely to fix the issues and improve the stability of the system. The changes in the patch do not include any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced in the previous fix commit. The regression caused a bug in rfkill notification to user-space. The patch correctly resets the firmware after rfkill is turned off and also sets the hardware state using wiphy_rfkill_set_hw_state.

The patch modifies the code in the ima_appraise_measurement() and ima_update_xattr() functions in the ima_appraise.c file, as well as the process_measurement() function in the ima_main.c file.

The patch replaces the usage of file->f_path.dentry with the file_dentry() function, which is expected to resolve the deadlock issue.

Considering that the patch addresses a real bug that can lead to a deadlock, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the IPv6 code related to the allocation of ICMPv6 destination entries. The bug was causing crashes in the mld_sendpack() function. The patch adds an error handling path to return an error pointer (-ENODEV) when the idev variable is not available.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can cause crashes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The bug fix addresses a critical issue that can lead to system instability, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a critical bug that causes a crash during booting on the netwinder platform. The crash is caused by overlapping PCI mappings introduced by a previous commit. Deleting the hunk of code that adds the overlapping mappings resolves the issue and allows the system to boot up fine with all PCI devices working.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug report states that when DDW (64-bit direct DMA on Power) is not enabled for NVMe devices, a fallback to 32-bit DMA via the IOMMU occurs, which uses 4K TCEs. However, the NVMe device driver assumes that the DMA alignment for the PRP entries matches the device's page size, causing a bug in nvme_setup_prps().

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: The patch changes the default device page size to 4K, which matches the IOMMU's page size used for DMA. This ensures that the DMA alignment for PRP entries matches the device's page size, preventing the bug from occurring.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a functional issue and does not include trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch has been tested: The patch mentions that with the functionally equivalent v3 of this patch, the hardware test exerciser survives when using 32-bit DMA, whereas without the patch, the kernel will encounter a bug within a few minutes. This indicates that the patch has been tested and verified to fix the bug.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the sata_mv driver. The patch adds an error check for the return value of devm_ioremap, and if it fails (returns NULL), it returns -ENOMEM to avoid the NULL pointer dereference.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue in the spc_emulate_evpd_b3() function in the target_core_spc.c file. The patch corrects a cut and paste error where the same variable, lba_map_segment_size, was being used twice for the Referrals VPD.

The patch replaces the second usage of lba_map_segment_size with lba_map_segment_multiplier, which suggests that the correct user data segment multiplier should be set instead of the user data segment size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix addressing a cut and paste error.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

The patch changes the allocation of memory for the devfreq statistics data structure to use the devfreq device pointer instead of the parent device pointer. This change ensures that the allocated memory is properly freed when the devfreq is disabled at runtime.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to resource leakage, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the ALSA USB audio driver for the MAYA44 USB(+) device. The driver currently aborts parsing too early, which results in missing input volume controls in the capture mixer. This is a real issue that affects the functionality of the device.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for the descriptor error after the parsing of the unit's input pins. This ensures that the capture mixer controls are properly parsed and not skipped.

The patch includes a reported-by tag and a tested-by tag, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by the community. This adds credibility to the fix.

The patch sets the IRQ_NO_BALANCING flag to prevent the affinity from being overwritten by setup_affinity(), ensuring that the affinity mask is not modified before the IPI is destroyed. This fix prevents the crash and resolves the issue.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to modify the acpi_find_child_device() function in the ACPI/scan module. Currently, if there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope, the first one found to be present is returned. However, this behavior is not defined by the spec, and it may not match the ASL writers' expectations.

The patch suggests modifying the find_child_checks() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change aims to cover the special case where devices without valid ACPI/PNP device IDs should be matched against a given bus address first.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be an improvement to handle a specific case that violates the ACPI specification.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes the unnecessary `enable_lock` spinlock in the `imx-tve` driver. The patch mentions that the DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, which prevents concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions. Additionally, holding a spinlock while calling `clk_prepare_enable()` is incorrect and can cause a warning if debugging is enabled.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it is a trivial fix that removes unnecessary code, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it is related to the stk-webcam driver and involves not using a stack for DMA.

2. The patch description explains that USB control messages require DMA to work, and using a stack-allocated buffer is not safe as it may not be in a DMA-enabled area.

3. The patch author and sign-off information is provided.

4. Looking at the code changes, a new variable `buf` of type `unsigned char*` is introduced and allocated using `kmalloc` with a size of `sizeof(u8)`.

5. The `usb_control_msg` function is modified to use `buf` instead of casting `value` to `(u8*)`.

6. After the `usb_control_msg` call, the value from `buf` is copied to `value` using `memcpy`.

7. The `buf` is freed using `kfree`.

8. The function returns the result of `usb_control_msg` call.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to power management in the Radeon DRM driver. The patch aims to use a stored value for the maximum voltage (max_vddc) instead of looking it up manually each time.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ni_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `ni_dpm.c` and the `rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info` function in `rv770_dpm.c`. These functions are responsible for parsing power tables and adjusting voltage values if necessary.

2. The patch removes the variable `vddc` from both functions since it is no longer needed.

3. In both functions, if the voltage value (`pl->vddc`) is equal to `0xff01`, the patch checks if `pi->max_vddc` is non-zero and assigns it to `pl->vddc`. This change ensures that the stored `max_vddc` value is used instead of looking it up manually.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to voltage adjustment in the Radeon DRM driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the logic of the code and improves efficiency by using a stored value instead of repeated lookups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to power management and does not contain any trivial changes.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to a non-existent VGA port on a Fujitsu D3003-S2 board. The bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists the VGA port incorrectly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, the bug report indicates that the Vbios connector table lists a non-existent VGA port, which can cause issues.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the bug may not directly cause any of the mentioned issues, it can lead to incorrect behavior or confusion for users trying to use the VGA port.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch adds a specific quirk for the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board to handle the incorrect VGA port listing in the Vbios connector table.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that can cause confusion and incorrect behavior for users.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function call in the lpc_eth.c driver. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check for an invalid value in the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) for the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module in the x86 architecture.

2. The check is added in the `vmx_set_msr` function in the `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c` file. If the `vmcs_config.vmentry_ctrl` indicates that the PAT CR should be loaded during entry, the patch checks if the value is valid using the `kvm_mtrr_valid` function.

3. The `kvm_mtrr_valid` function is defined in the `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c` file. It checks if the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) value is valid by comparing it with the supported MTRR types.

4. The `kvm_mtrr_valid` function is also declared in the `arch/x86/kvm/x86.h` file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where a guest sets an invalid value in the PAT CR, which should result in a #GP (General Protection) exception. The patch adds the necessary check to ensure that the value is valid before setting it.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential security issue (invalid PAT CR value) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to power-saving (PS) idle behavior in the ath9k wireless driver. The patch corrects an inverted check for PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK, ensuring that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission is pending.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, the patch addresses a bug in the PS idle behavior, which can impact power consumption and overall system performance.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? No, the bug does not fall into any of these categories.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? No, the patch addresses a specific bug and does not include any trivial changes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential kernel oops triggered by dereferencing a NULL Rx skb. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and hdelta is just a little larger than half a buffer time (e.g., in a ping-pong buffer). In such cases, the current condition wrongly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this issue, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that the condition is not triggered when hdelta is only slightly larger than half a buffer time.

The patch also mentions that jiffies, which is used for hdelta calculation, is not high resolution and may have inaccuracies. This comment highlights the need to consider the inaccuracy of jiffies when comparing hdelta.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario where the current condition for double acknowledged interrupts fails. It improves the accuracy of interrupt handling in the ALSA PCM subsystem. Since it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect interrupt handling, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata. The current implementation uses the padded length instead of the real length, which is a bug according to the specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all the specified metadata has been 32-bit, where the aligned and data length are the same width. However, it is still important to fix this bug to adhere to the specification.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it is fine to include it in the patch.

3. The patch gets rid of magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the bug fix.

Overall, the patch addresses a real bug in the encoding of metadata and improves code quality. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to USB Link Power Management (LPM) functionality in the Linux kernel. The bug causes the LPM feature to be non-functional due to the lack of setting the "lpm_capable" field for the root hub device.

The patch adds the necessary code to check and set "lpm_capable" when registering a root hub device, ensuring that LPM is functional. It also mentions that the patch can be backported to older kernels as old as v3.15, which indicates that it is a stable candidate.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that the patch addresses it directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to ACPI / EC interrupts. The patch ensures that a SCI (System Control Interrupt) is not counted as a false interrupt in certain cases.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue related to interrupt handling in the ACPI / EC subsystem.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not directly cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the calculate_imbalance() function in the sched/balancing module. The bug can cause an imbalance overflow when the condition local->avg_load >= busiest->avg_load >= sds->avg_load is met. This can lead to constant task bouncing between CPUs, especially when there are pinned tasks.

The fix involves skipping the assignment and assuming imbalance=0 when local->avg_load > sds->avg_load. This prevents the imbalance overflow and resolves the issue.

The patch also includes a test case to reproduce the bug and verify the fix.

Considering that the bug can cause an imbalance and potential task bouncing, which can impact system performance and stability, and that the patch provides a clear and targeted fix, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for enabling Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) support for all variants of RGMII interfaces. The patch extends the check for PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII to cover all RGMII variants, allowing EEE support for any of these modes.

Since enabling EEE for RGMII interfaces is a critical functionality and not a trivial fix, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to pen events and touch events competing with each other on tablets that support both pen and touch input.

2. The patch ensures that if the pen comes in proximity while touch is down, touch events are forced to finish before sending pen events. This prevents any unfinished touch events from interfering with pen events.

3. The patch includes changes in the "wacom_intuos_inout" and "wacom_bpt_pen" functions to check if touch is down before processing pen events. If touch is down, the function returns without processing the pen events.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues with pen and touch input on tablets. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The MMU is disabled in ExitBootServices(), which causes unaligned accesses to RAM to no longer be supported. This can result in alignment faults and potential issues with manipulating the FDT.

2. The patch fixes the issue by moving the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that the FDT manipulation is done before the MMU is disabled, avoiding alignment faults.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, indicating that it is indeed addressing a specific problem.

4. The patch has been tested and has a Tested-by tag, indicating that it has been verified to work as intended.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, including the original author and a maintainer.

2. The patch is signed-off by Andrzej Hajda and reviewed by Joonyoung Shim, both from Samsung.

3. The patch modifies the `mixer_enable_vblank` function in the `exynos_mixer.c` file. It adds two new lines of code to clear the vsync indicator before configuring vsync.

4. The patch also modifies the `mixer_disable_vblank` function by adding a line of code to clear the vsync interrupt.

5. Additionally, the patch modifies the `mixer_enable` function by adding a conditional check to clear the vsync interrupt if it is enabled.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to vsync configuration in the Exynos DRM driver. However, without further context or details about the bug it fixes, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it falls into the categories of critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the InfiniBand (IB) core communication manager (CM). The bug causes potential issues with erasing and freeing the cm_id_priv structure, leading to duplicate free and use-after-free scenarios.

The patch addresses this issue by ensuring that the cm_id_priv structure is erased only once before freeing it. It includes modifications in the cm_destroy_id() and ib_send_cm_sidr_rep() functions to handle the erasure correctly.

Considering that the patch fixes a real bug that can lead to potential memory corruption and use-after-free scenarios, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to support NR_CPUS = 4096 on SPARC64 platforms.
2. Currently, NR_CPUS is limited to 4064 due to the allocation of a single page for NR_CPUS mondo entries in init_cpu_send_mondo_info().
3. The proposed fix is to allocate (2^order) pages based on the size of cpu_list for possible CPUs.
4. The patch ensures that cpu_list_pa and cpu_mondo_block_pa, which are not used in asm code, do not break imm13 offsets from the base PA.
5. The patch includes a bug reference (Orabug: 25505750) and is signed-off by multiple contributors.
6. The patch modifies the range of NR_CPUS in the Kconfig file to allow a maximum of 4096 CPUs for SPARC64 platforms.
7. In the irq_64.c file, the init_cpu_send_mondo_info() function is modified to align the mondo block to 64 bytes and allocate the cpu_list page correctly.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to the limitation of NR_CPUS on SPARC64 platforms. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to be well-reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug and meets the criteria for inclusion.

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The kernfs_deactivate() function in the kernel forgot to check whether KERNFS_LOCKDEP is set before performing lockdep annotations. This can lead to uninitialized lockdep_map being fed to lockdep, triggering warnings and potentially causing issues like the USB stick hotunplug error mentioned.

2. The bug can cause a real issue: The warning message indicates a potential problem with USB disconnect and device number 2. This suggests that the bug can lead to device disconnection issues, which can be critical in certain scenarios.

3. The patch fixes the bug: The patch modifies the kernfs_deactivate() function to perform lockdep annotations only if KERNFS_LOCKDEP is set. This ensures that the lockdep_map is properly initialized and avoids triggering warnings and potential issues.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a real bug and does not include trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent potential issues with USB device disconnection.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a failure to open PCM device with -ENOSYS in Terratec Phase 88. This indicates a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the device.

2. The patch addresses the issue by correctly setting the IDs for the Selector Function Blocks of AVC Audio subunit. The current implementation incorrectly sets the IDs to 0, but the correct IDs are 9 and 8.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" and "Tested-by" tags, indicating that the bug was reported and tested by a user.

4. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases, as indicated by the "Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org> # v3.16+" line.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that allowed PCH PWM override on IVB (Ivy Bridge) hardware. The reason for the revert is that it breaks the backlight controls on an Asus Zenbook with an eDP panel.

Given that this patch addresses a specific issue related to backlight controls on a specific hardware configuration, it does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing unlock on the error handle path in the `net2272_irq()` function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the memremap's helper function try_ram_remap(). Currently, the function dereferences a struct page pointer derived from a PFN (Page Frame Number) that is assumed to be valid and covered by the kernel direct mapping. However, this assumption may not hold true on all architectures, specifically ARM and arm64, where the 'System RAM' iomem region may include regions for which pfn_valid() returns false.

To fix this, the patch adds a check using pfn_valid() before calling pfn_to_page(). This ensures that both __va() and pfn_to_page() are only called on PFNs/physical addresses for which pfn_valid() returns true.

The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential issue related to PFN validity and ensures correct usage of __va() and pfn_to_page(), without introducing any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "net: macb: initialize checksum when using checksum offloading"
   - This patch aims to fix an issue related to checksum offloading in the macb network driver.

2. Changes since v2:
   - The patch author addressed a legitimate objection by not blindly modifying SKB contents.

3. Changes since v1:
   - The patch author dropped disabling HW checksum offload for Zynq.
   - The patch author initialized the checksum similar to net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c.

4. Patch details:
   - The patch adds a new inline function `macb_clear_csum` to clear the checksum field in the SKB structure.
   - The function checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled (`skb->ip_summed != CHECKSUM_PARTIAL`).
   - If checksum offloading is enabled, the function initializes the checksum field to 0.
   - The patch also modifies the `macb_start_xmit` function to call `macb_clear_csum` before transmitting the packet.
   - If `macb_clear_csum` fails, the packet is freed and the transmission is considered successful.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real issue related to checksum offloading in the macb network driver. It ensures that the checksum field is properly initialized, which is necessary for correct transmission in certain cases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The code enabling the clock was removed from the probe function, resulting in a dysfunctional gpio controller when power management is disabled.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

3. The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which indicates that it is a bug fix.

4. The patch adds back the clock initialization to support CONFIG_PM=n, ensuring that the clock is enabled even when power management is disabled.

5. The patch also includes error handling for the clock initialization, enabling proper cleanup in case of failure.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the relevant developers.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an incorrect OOM (Out of Memory) return value and also improves error handling by returning early for clarity. However, it does not address any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Microsoft Surface docks that use the Realtek RTL8152 chip. This patch adds the necessary USB device IDs for the Microsoft Surface 2 dock and Microsoft Surface 3 dock, as well as the corresponding driver information.

Since this patch is adding support for specific hardware devices and does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to false lockdep warnings in the ALSA PCM core. The patch addresses the problem by passing the lock subclass calculated from the depth in `snd_pcm_action_group()` and dropping a possibly wrong lock subclass set in `snd_pcm_action_lock_mutex()`.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to lockdep warnings, it can be considered a valid fix for a potential bug. However, without further information about the severity and impact of the false lockdep warnings, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation of the severity and impact of the false lockdep warnings before making a final decision on whether to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The patch addresses an error handling issue in the ftdi_sio driver related to reading the latency timer. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in USB serial communication.

The patch addresses the issue of potentially getting stuck in an endless loop by restarting the search after unlocking the list. 

The patch also mentions that the original patch, which introduced the bug, was trying to fix a reported soft lockup issue. However, it is believed that the soft lockup problem has already been fixed by a different patch.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a hang. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to unregistering conflicting framebuffer drivers. The patch ensures that if the removal of a conflicting fb driver fails, the loading of the second driver is aborted to avoid potential kernel panics. 

The patch modifies the function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` to return an integer value indicating success or failure. It also updates the function `do_register_framebuffer` and `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` to handle the return value of `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and propagate the error code if necessary.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical issue that could lead to kernel panics, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch is based on a bug report from Bugzilla, which provides additional context and evidence of the bug.

3. The patch addresses the root cause of the bug, which is related to the optional wm8775 component. The patch checks whether the module was actually loaded, ensuring safer behavior.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The patch modifies multiple files in the drivers/media/pci/cx88/ directory, which suggests that it is targeting the specific issue and not making trivial changes.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a situation where the system fails in mysterious ways due to the inability to find enough memory to instantiate RTAS (Runtime Abstraction Services) during a network install.

2. The bug can cause various failures: The patch mentions that SMT threads, storage, and network were all completely broken due to this issue.

3. The patch introduces a panic mechanism: Instead of allowing the system to continue running in a potentially unstable state, the patch adds a panic call if RTAS exists and memory allocation for it fails. This ensures that the system immediately halts and notifies the user about the failure.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on addressing the critical bug.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes an issue related to the completion of the Control write status stage in the renesas_usbhs driver. The patch prevents the incorrect clearing of PID_BUF in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop() function, which can cause the controller to be unable to complete the status stage.

Considering that this issue can potentially lead to data corruption or incomplete control transfers, it can be categorized as a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a significant issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file.

The purpose of the cond_resched() call was to allow scheduling in non-atomic contexts during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy(). However, it was found that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy() is called in atomic context, making scheduling not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386.

The patch removes the cond_resched() call and explains that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration, it is still better than using an if (in_atomic()) cond_resched() check to cover only non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific configuration issue and removes unnecessary code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect comparison in the powernow_k6_cpu_exit() function in the powernow-k6 driver.

2. The incorrect comparison is between 'i' (the loop index) and 'max_multiplier'. The patch correctly states that 'max_multiplier' should be compared with clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself.

3. Additionally, the patch replaces the hard-coded loop count of 8 with a condition that checks for CPUFREQ_TABLE_END. This makes the loop more flexible and avoids potential issues if the number of elements in clock_ratio changes in the future.

4. The patch includes a Reported-by tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Viresh Kumar, and Signed-off-by tags from Srivatsa S. Bhat and Rafael J. Wysocki.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug in the powernow-k6 driver and improves the code's flexibility.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rtc: handle errors correctly in rtc_irq_set_state()". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function.

2. The code checks the correctness of the parameters but unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer. This means that even if the parameters are incorrect, the hrtimer is still armed or disarmed.

3. The consequence of this behavior is that a random task might arm/disarm the rtc timer, surprising the real owner by either generating events or stopping them. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially critical issues.

4. The patch adds an error handling mechanism by introducing a check for errors. If an error occurs, the function jumps to the "out" label, which releases the lock and returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause unexpected behavior and potentially impact system stability. It also introduces proper error handling, which is an important aspect of maintaining code reliability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a backport of changes made to the x86 page fault handler for making it retryable and killable. The patch aims to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation on 64-bit sparc.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is an optimization to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would classify this patch as a performance optimization rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the check on the PCI device type in vfio_pci_probe(). The current code incorrectly uses the PCI_HEADER_TYPE value to mask the type value, which is a mistake. The patch fixes this by directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a specific behavior in the vfio-pci driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c) in the "drm/i915" driver.

2. The reason for reverting the commit is that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

3. The original patch being reverted was considered nonsensical since the WARNING backtraces in the referenced bugzilla were about "gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits" mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

4. The patch includes changes in two files: "drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_lvds.c" and "drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_panel.c".

5. In "intel_lvds.c", the patch adds code to set the "8to6 dither" flag in the "gmch_pfit.control" field if the hardware is gen2/3.

6. In "intel_panel.c", the patch ensures that pre-965 hardware sets the dither correctly for 18bpp panels.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware and fixes a reported problem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to handling level interrupts in the KVM virtualization subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to restarting the device and handling requests to stop transmission aggregation. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the severity of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a security risk. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and its impact, and I will be able to give a more accurate assessment of whether the patch should be accepted in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds locking using zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, preventing invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to invalid memory access. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses the issue of checking the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit of dev->flags in usbnet_stop() before it is cleared when dev->flags is set to 0.

2. The problem was identified by Oliver Neukum and the fix was provided by Eugene Shatokhin.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes in the code to read the value of EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit before it is cleared.

4. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue related to the handling of the EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM bit in usbnet_stop().
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug caused incorrect antenna selection when BT (Bluetooth) is active, which could lead to disturbances and connectivity issues on certain devices.

2. The bug fix is necessary for devices with a single antenna: The patch specifically addresses the issue on devices like the 3160, which couldn't connect at all when BT was active. This indicates that the bug fix is critical for affected devices.

3. The patch references a bug report: The patch includes a reference to a bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97181), which adds credibility to the issue being addressed.

4. The patch is targeted for stable releases: The patch includes the "CC: <stable@vger.kernel.org> [3.17+]" line, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases of the Linux kernel.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve modifying the antenna selection logic in the code.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be ACKed.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a list corruption issue in urb dequeue at host removal in the xhci driver. This indicates that it addresses a potential bug.

2. The patch description explains that the xhci driver frees data for all devices, both USB2 and USB3, the first time usb_remove_hcd() is called. However, when usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus, it tries to dequeue all pending urbs and touches td_list, which has already been freed for that endpoint. This indicates a potential issue that can lead to list corruption.

3. The patch includes Cc and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reported and tested by Joe Lawrence.

4. The patch is signed-off by Mathias Nyman and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the xhci_urb_dequeue() function in the xhci.c file. It adds a condition to the for loop, checking if xhci->devs[urb->dev->slot_id] is valid before continuing the loop. This change ensures that the loop only iterates when the device is valid, preventing the list corruption issue.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause list corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds status and return request handlers for the wiimote HID driver. This indicates that it is adding functionality to handle status reports and return reports from the wiimote.

2. The status handler resets the current drm when an extension is plugged in and sends a status report. This ensures that the drm remains consistent.

3. The return handler handles success and failure reports for requests sent to the wiimote.

4. The patch includes the necessary function definitions and structures for the handlers.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is adding important functionality to handle status and return reports from the wiimote. It addresses potential issues related to drm consistency and handling of request success/failure. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a reported bug by Chris Metcalf, where sched_can_stop_tick() sometimes fails to re-enable the tick.
2. The patch identifies a problem with rq->cfs.nr_running, which can be 1 even though there are multiple runnable CFS tasks in the cgroup case.
3. The patch also identifies a misplaced test for fifo_nr_running and suggests moving it after the rr_nr_running tests.
4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it resolves a specific commit.
5. The patch has been tested by Chris Metcalf.
6. It has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including Peter Zijlstra (Intel) and Ingo Molnar.

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, it addresses a bug related to the reset of blkt changes during online settings.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - It does not seem to introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a false-positive warning issue in the dev_pm_domain_set() function. The patch checks if the pointer passed to dev_pm_domain_set() is NULL and skips the warning in that case. 

Since this patch addresses a real issue that can potentially lead to false-positive warnings, it can be considered a valid fix. However, without further information about the severity and impact of the false-positive warnings, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation and testing of the patch to determine its impact and whether it qualifies as a critical bug fix. Based on that assessment, a decision can be made whether to accept it in a stable release or not.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drivers/tty: require read access for controlling terminal" and is described as a hardening fix. It aims to prevent write-only access to other users' ttys, which is typically only granted through setgid tty executables.

2. The patch modifies the `tty_open` function in `tty_io.c`. It adds a check to ensure that a process that only has write access to the tty cannot obtain the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. If the file mode (`f_mode`) of the file descriptor includes the `FMODE_READ` flag, the `__proc_set_tty` function is called to set the tty as the controlling terminal.

3. The patch also modifies the `tiocsctty` function in `tty_io.c`. It adds a similar check to prevent a process without read access to the file descriptor from setting the tty as the controlling terminal. If the file mode does not include the `FMODE_READ` flag and the process does not have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, the function returns `-EPERM` to indicate a permission error.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential security issue by ensuring that write-only access to ttys does not grant full privileges associated with having a controlling terminal. The changes are not trivial and do not involve spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves managing the WM8731 ACTIVE bit as a supply widget. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to adjusting the display configuration after power state changes in the amdgpu driver. 

The patch itself does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an improvement or adjustment rather than fixing a critical issue.

Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively trivial, as they involve moving the call to `amdgpu_dpm_display_configuration_changed()` from a different location within the function to a new location.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses the issue of checking write access on the underlying inode when truncating a file in the overlay filesystem (ovl). It ensures consistency by checking write access on the lower file before copy-up.

The patch also includes a test case to verify the fix, which is a good practice.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a mislabeled USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) in the ftdi_sio driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the sendfile(2) system call. The patch addresses a scenario where sendfile(2) can be misused to issue lots of writes into arbitrary file descriptors, making them unkillable. The patch adds a test for pending signals in the splice_from_pipe_next() function to ensure that the process can be killed even when there are always buffers available.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical issue that can lead to unkillable processes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an off-by-one error when addressing the IOR (Input/Output Control register) in the 104-quad-8 driver in the iio subsystem. The patch correctly adjusts the base offset by adding 1 to the original value.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check for pending work in the vmpressure function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to add a check for a valid clkctrl_offs in the _omap4_wait_target_ready/disable functions in the omap_hwmod.c file for ARM OMAP4+ architecture.

2. The check is added to consider the value of prcm.omap4.flags, specifically if the HWMOD_OMAP4_ZERO_CLKCTRL_OFFSET flag is set. If this flag is set, a clkctrl_offs value of 0 is considered valid.

3. If the clkctrl_offs is 0 and the HWMOD_OMAP4_ZERO_CLKCTRL_OFFSET flag is not set, the patch returns 0 without calling the low-level CM (Clock Module) function.

4. The patch is signed-off by Dave Gerlach and acked by Tero Kristo.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific condition related to clkctrl_offs and the HWMOD_OMAP4_ZERO_CLKCTRL_OFFSET flag. It does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch description states that commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, which can be problematic since some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot. This indicates a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The patch then sets the IRQ trigger type to IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING if it is not already configured. This ensures that the IRQ is triggered on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. This change seems reasonable and necessary to handle the potential issue mentioned earlier.

3. Finally, the patch updates the devm_request_irq() call to include the irq_type flag when requesting the IRQ. This ensures that the correct trigger type is used when registering the IRQ handler.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to IRQ setup. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to be necessary for proper functionality on certain boards. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the intel_pstate driver related to the intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() function. The function currently calls intel_pstate_update_perf_limits(), which can cause global P-state limits to change. This behavior is unnecessary and confusing.

The patch proposes dropping the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(). This change is justified because in passive mode, the global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor and are not taken into account by governors when making decisions. Therefore, making the global limits follow the per-policy limits serves no purpose and may go against user expectations.

The patch also mentions that this change does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. By removing the code updating the per-CPU limits in passive mode, the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account, as expected.

Overall, the patch fixes a behavior that is unnecessary, confusing, and potentially against user expectations. It does not introduce any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue in the intel_pstate driver. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to incorrect access of enum controls in the wm8994 codec driver. The patch changes the access method from `value.integer.value[]` to `value.enumerated.item[]` for the DRC Mode and EQ Mode enum controls.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or functionality in the driver, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting the access method for the enum controls.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logic issue in the `netxen_nic_poll()` function in the `netxen_nic_main.c` file. The patch ensures that the poller returns the budget value when it wants to be called again, even if the driver limits TX completion.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a logic improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a critical bug related to the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in MCG paravirtualization. The issue arises when a client re-register event triggers the cleanup of all MCGs. However, since the cleanup is performed in a work queue, there is a possibility that the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) could leave and re-join groups before the cleanup occurs. This leads to the cleanup pruning the newly-joined MCGs, leaving the ULP without the actual MCGs while believing it joined them.

The patch fixes this issue by setting the flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clearing it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup occurs correctly and prevents the ULP from losing the joined MCGs.

The patch also includes proper sign-offs and a review, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and incorrect behavior. It does not contain any trivial fixes, such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a quirk to avoid setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE on certain machines, specifically Dell XPS 13 models. This is done because these machines suffer from non-functional backlight controls if BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE is set.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the i915 driver to apply the quirk. It adds a new quirk flag QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE and a corresponding function quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable to set the flag.

3. The patch also updates the intel_quirks array in intel_display.c to include the Dell XPS13 models and the quirk_no_pcm_pwm_enable function.

4. Finally, the patch modifies the intel_panel_enable_backlight function in intel_panel.c to check for the QUIRK_NO_PCH_PWM_ENABLE flag before setting BLM_PCH_PWM_ENABLE.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue with backlight controls on Dell XPS 13 models and provides a quirk to avoid the problem. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The issue was observed during the mkfs.f2fs process on a 5GB SD card.
4. The patch has been tested and reported by Max Filippov.
5. The patch is signed-off by James Bottomley and Namjae Jeon.
6. The patch modifies the `blk_queue_get_max_sectors` function in `include/linux/blkdev.h` to ensure the max discard sectors limit is not exceeded.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

The patch addresses a warning related to a type cast in the NVMe driver on 32-bit machines. It introduces a new temporary variable to extract a pointer from a __u64 structure member using a double cast.

This bug can cause receive queues to become full and prevent new interrupts about completions.

The patch addresses this issue by scheduling NAPI once the port_up flag is set, which allows processing of all completions and releasing them. This prevents the queues from freezing if they are full.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and potential system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate call to `ieee80211_register_hw()` in the `rtl92se_fw_cb()` function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the need for the shark_led_work function to take the v4l2 lock. It also removes the code that checks if the video device is registered before executing the LED work. Additionally, it cancels the LED work in the usb_shark_disconnect function and removes the cancellation from the usb_shark_release function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing unnecessary code related to the v4l2 lock and LED work cancellation. However, it does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition that can lead to incorrect marking of blocks as clean or dirty in the dm cache.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing the race condition and ensuring proper block marking. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the virtio-scsi LUN structure. The patch checks if byte 0 of the LUN structure is set to '1', as required by the virtio spec. If it is not set to '1', the patch sends a bad target response.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific requirement of the virtio-scsi spec, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on the specific issue at hand.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a non-trivial issue related to the virtio-scsi LUN structure.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential bug related to DMA-API in the Linux kernel. The patch switches the check from using `_text` to `_stext` in the `check_for_illegal_area` function in `lib/dma-debug.c`. This change is made to ensure that memory mapping from kernel text or rodata is correctly detected.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a relatively minor fix that improves the accuracy of the check.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug. The patch only exports the `cpu_tss` symbol with `EXPORT_PER_CPU_SYMBOL` instead of `EXPORT_PER_CPU_SYMBOL_GPL`. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to preemption issues when updating per-cpu tstats in ip_tunnel.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a critical issue that can lead to data transmission problems, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical bug. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, to lock access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. This indicates that there are potential concurrent modifications to the resource tree in other patches of the series.

2. The patch adds the `down()` function call to acquire the semaphore before accessing the resource tree and the `up()` function call to release the semaphore after the access. This ensures proper synchronization and prevents race conditions.

3. The patch also modifies the `vmbus_allocate_mmio()` function to return the appropriate error code (`-ENXIO`) when the resource allocation fails. Previously, the function always returned `-ENXIO`, which was incorrect.

4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors, indicating their agreement with the changes.

Overall, the patch addresses potential concurrency issues and improves the correctness of resource allocation in the `vmbus_allocate_mmio()` function. It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the treatment of drm_vblank_offdelay in the drm_vblank_on() function. The patch addresses a regression introduced in Linux 3.18+ where a kms driver could override the user's choice of reenabling vblank irqs when the user specified a value of zero.

The patch ensures that vblanks are only reenabled if there are clients left or if the user requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0. This change aligns with the intended behavior and resolves the accidental addition of enabling vblanks in the "delayed disable" case.

Considering the patch fixes a regression and keeps the user in control, it appears to address a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to handling encapsulation offloads when computing segment lengths in the net core.
2. It introduces a new variable `thlen` to store the length of the inner network headers.
3. If `skb->encapsulation` is set, the patch calculates `thlen` by subtracting the `skb_transport_header` from `skb_inner_transport_header` and adds `inner_tcp_hdrlen(skb)` to it.
4. If `skb->encapsulation` is not set, the patch calculates `thlen` as `tcp_hdrlen(skb)`.
5. The patch then returns `thlen + shinfo->gso_size` as the segment length.
6. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to encapsulation offloads and correctly calculates the segment length. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a warning generated by gcc 4.1.2 in the f81534_port_probe() function of the f81534.c file.

2. The warning states that the comparison in line 1250 is always false due to the limited range of the data type.

3. The patch suggests using an intermediate variable of type int to fix this issue.

4. Additionally, the patch forwards the actual error code instead of converting it to -ENODEV.

5. The patch also removes the useless check for F81534_NUM_PORT, as the callee always returns a valid port number in case of success.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a warning and improves the error handling in the f81534_port_probe() function. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and potential security issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the UDF (Universal Disk Format) filesystem, which can lead to data corruption when converting file types. The race condition occurs when two O_APPEND writes happen simultaneously, and if the combined size of the writes exceeds the inode's capacity, it can overwrite kernel buffers beyond the inode, potentially corrupting the filesystem.

The patch fixes the issue by acquiring the i_mutex lock before checking whether the write fits into the inode. It also uses __generic_file_aio_write() instead of generic_file_aio_write(), which puts the check and write operations into one critical section.

The patch includes a reported-by tag and a signed-off-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Al Viro and the patch was reviewed and approved by Jan Kara.

Additionally, the patch includes a WARN_ON_ONCE statement in udf_expand_file_adinicb() to ensure that the i_mutex lock is held when expanding the file's allocation descriptor inodes.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption in the UDF filesystem. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the QP1 GRH flow in the `build_mlx_header` procedure.

5. The patch includes appropriate error handling and logging in case of failure.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like data corruption or unexpected behavior. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that restricted a virtual function (VF) from configuring any VLAN mode. The reason for reverting this restriction is to allow the same multicast address to be used with any VLAN, saving multicast filters.

However, the patch also removes code that checks for specific MAC operations (QLC_MAC_STAR_ADD and QLC_MAC_STAR_DEL) and returns an error if these operations are detected. Without this check, it is possible for a VF to configure MAC + any VLAN filters, which was previously disallowed.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of allowing MAC + any VLAN filters from a VF. If this change introduces a real and critical bug, such as a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, if this change is considered a trivial fix or does not address any critical issues, then the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

To make a final decision, further analysis and understanding of the specific use case and potential implications of allowing MAC + any VLAN filters from a VF would be necessary.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to disable PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. This is because using the default PM Domain with PM_CLK prevents the registration of the real Clock Domain from DT later.

2. The patch mentions that most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms now use DT-based PM Domains for PM runtime management of the module clocks. The explicit SoC checks are replaced by a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT, simplifying the platform logic.

3. Backwards compatibility with old DTs (mainly for R-Car Gen2) is provided by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

4. The default PM Domain is still needed for backward compatibility with old DTs lacking PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy (non-DT) ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support, and legacy SuperH.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to PM runtime management on multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms with genpd support. It introduces changes to simplify the platform logic and ensure backward compatibility.

Considering that the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The commit being reverted is 23c405912b88.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it should not contain any trivial fixes.

In this case, the patch is reverting a previous fix for a memory leak. Memory leaks can be considered critical issues as they can lead to resource exhaustion and system instability over time. However, without further context or information about the specific bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue.

Since the patch is reverting a previous fix, it is important to understand the reasons behind this decision. If the original fix introduced unintended side effects or caused regressions, reverting it might be necessary. However, if the original fix was effective and necessary, reverting it could reintroduce the memory leak issue.

Without more information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and analysis of the bug and the reasons for reverting the fix before making a final determination.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the release of the MMC host after a discard operation. The issue is caused by an invalid check of the `req->cmd_flags & MMC_REQ_SPECIAL_MASK` condition, which prevents the host from being released when it should.

The patch addresses the issue by marking the special request down before the discard/flush operation. It has been reported by Harold (SoonYeal) Yang and reviewed by Seungwon Jeon. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption and that it has been reviewed and acknowledged by relevant individuals, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The previous limitation of setting the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to a maximum of 1500 prevented them from taking advantage of jumbo frames and other larger MTU sizes. This limitation can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

2. The patch relaxes the MTU constraints: It allows the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to be set to larger values, up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead. This change enables vxlan devices to utilize larger MTU sizes, improving performance and efficiency.

3. The default MTU remains 1500 for compatibility: The patch ensures that the default MTU value remains unchanged, ensuring compatibility with existing configurations.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on addressing the specific issue of MTU constraints for vxlan devices and does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the preparation of a port STP update in the net/dsa/slave.c file. The issue is that a driver may return -EOPNOTSUPP from the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev. This issue has been reported by Andrew Lunn and the patch has been reviewed and Acked by Andrew Lunn as well.

The patch modifies the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function by introducing the variables `p` and `ds` to access the parent switch and slave private data. It then checks if the switchdev transaction is in the prepare phase and sets `ret` to 0 if the driver supports port STP update, or -EOPNOTSUPP if it does not. Otherwise, it calls the driver's port_stp_update function with the appropriate parameters.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues with STP state updates on certain switches.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW accessing the freed buffers and potentially causing a host crash.

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is removing a call to `plane->destroy` from the `omap_crtc_destroy` function in the `omap_crtc.c` file. The patch claims that this call is no longer needed because all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch claims to fix a crash caused by double freeing the plane.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   It is not explicitly mentioned, but a crash can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a crash. However, further review and testing may be necessary to ensure that the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "SUNRPC: set per-net PipeFS superblock before notification". From the title, it seems that the patch is related to the SUNRPC subsystem and involves setting the per-net PipeFS superblock before sending a notification.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch adds a line "sn->pipefs_sb = sb;" after the dprintk statement. This line sets the "pipefs_sb" field of the "sn" structure to the "sb" value.

3. The patch also adds a line "sn->pipefs_sb = NULL;" before returning from the error handling path. This line sets the "pipefs_sb" field of the "sn" structure to NULL.

4. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a code improvement related to setting the per-net PipeFS superblock.

Based on the analysis, this patch seems to be a code improvement rather than fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c driver.

2. The patch description explains that rep_data is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Tested-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

4. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the wacom_retrieve_report_data() function.

5. In the modified code, the line "rep_data[0] = 12;" sets the first element of rep_data to 12.

6. The line "result = wacom_get_report(intf, WAC_HID_FEATURE_REPORT, rep_data[0], rep_data, 2, WAC_MSG_RETRIES);" calls the wacom_get_report() function with the modified rep_data.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting the usage of rep_data. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch claims to fix an issue where Rx data sometimes drops in non-DMA transfer mode due to an incorrect read complete condition.

2. Code changes: The patch modifies the pch_spi_handler_sub function in the spi-topcliff-pch.c file.

3. Code analysis: The patch adds an additional condition to check if the transfer is complete. If the condition is met, the patch disables interrupts, sets the transfer status to complete, and wakes up the waiting process. Otherwise, it logs an error message.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and meets the criteria for inclusion.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug reported by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, who confirmed that the bug is benign but still needs fixing.

2. The bug causes an undefined behavior warning due to an incorrect loop iteration in the `rtl8821ae_dm_clear_txpower_tracking_state` function.

3. The loop iterates from 0 to 3, but the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array only has two members, leading to potential overwriting of memory.

4. Although the bug doesn't seem to affect functionality or the build, it is still considered a real issue that needs to be addressed.

5. The patch changes the size of the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which resolves the bug.

6. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the patch author and maintainers.

Based on these points, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption. It meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be included (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/i915/gen9: Add WaFbcTurnOffFbcWatermark." According to the bspec (presumably the Intel Graphics Programmer's Reference Manual), this patch prevents screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch adds a new workaround to the gen9_init_clock_gating function in the intel_pm.c file. It writes a value to the DISP_ARB_CTL register to turn off the FBC watermark for the skl, bxt, and kbl platforms.

3. References:
   The patch references HSD#2135555, HSD#2137270, and BSID#562. These references likely provide additional information about the issues being addressed.

4. Cc and Signed-off-by:
   The patch includes Cc (Carbon Copy) recipients and Signed-off-by tags from relevant individuals involved in the development and review process.

5. Link:
   The patch includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork.freedesktop.org website.

Based on the information provided, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to screen corruption when FBC is used. It is not a trivial fix, as it introduces a new workaround specific to certain platforms. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug related to stack overflow when using CONFIG_KASAN with gcc-5. This bug can lead to build errors and potentially cause kernel stack overflow. The patch removes the use of ACCESS_ONCE, which is causing the issue, and has been verified to improve the object code generated by the compiler.

Considering the severity of the bug and the fact that the patch has been tested and verified, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause build errors and potential stack overflow issues, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up. The patch includes a call to `mtk_stop()` to properly stop and free DMA resources and restore the state changed by `mtk_open()` during module removal.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is fixing a specific issue in the ext4 filesystem related to collapsing a range. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

1. The patch is titled "ext4: use truncate_pagecache() in collapse range." This suggests that it aims to improve the behavior of the ext4 filesystem when collapsing a range.

2. The patch description explains that the current code uses `truncate_pagecache_range()` in the collapse range, but it should be using `truncate_pagecache()` instead. The reason for this change is that the page cache needs to be truncated from the specified offset to the end of the file, and `truncate_pagecache()` also removes private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range because the end of the file is being shifted.

3. The patch is signed-off by Lukas Czerner and Theodore Ts'o, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. In the code changes, the line `truncate_pagecache_range(inode, offset, -1);` is replaced with `truncate_pagecache(inode, offset);`. This change aligns with the explanation provided in the patch description.

5. The code change is followed by a comment indicating that it waits for any existing direct I/O (dio) operations to complete and releases the inode's block lock.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue in the ext4 filesystem and improves its behavior when collapsing a range. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves replacing a function call and has been reviewed by relevant individuals.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the s3c_hsotg_phy_disable function being called multiple times, causing a decrease in the phy reference counter below zero. This can result in consecutive module insertions failing.

The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from both s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions. It explains that s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable. Additionally, s3c_hsotg_remove should only be called after udc_stop, so there is no need to disable the phy again there.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch adds a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM, allowing the HCR to be changed on a per-vCPU basis. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical problems.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freezing groups with stopped tasks in the cgroup freezer subsystem. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it in the original locations where freezing is checked.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix. This indicates that the patch addresses a real and critical bug.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch should be accepted (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues with freezing groups containing stopped tasks.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real and critical bug: The bug causes a splat (kernel warning) during the netns destroy path, indicating a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

2. The bug can lead to data corruption: The warning message mentions the removal of a non-empty directory, indicating a potential data corruption issue.

3. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the lack of removal of net/ip6t_hashlimit/* entries in the hashlimit_proc_net_exit() function, which causes the warning message.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It introduces changes to remove the IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories in the netns destroy path, which is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug and prevent potential data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only replaces a call to `snprintf` with `strlcpy` to fix a possible issue with formatting characters in the device name. This change does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue with the DMA debug API not handling multiple mappings of the same buffer correctly. This bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It describes how the debug_dma_mapping_error function was not setting the map_err_type correctly when multiple mappings existed. The patch resolves this by updating the search algorithm to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address.

3. The patch also mentions a secondary side effect, where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type. However, this behavior is considered preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the author and reviewers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses the issue of passing the correct pointer to free_irq(). It states that free_irq() expects the same pointer that was passed to request_irq(), otherwise the IRQ is not freed.

2. The patch includes a Coccinelle script that was used to identify the issue.

3. The patch is signed-off by Lars-Peter Clausen, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch includes Cc (carbon copy) recipients, including Srinidhi Kasagar and Linus Walleij, suggesting that they have been notified and may have reviewed the patch.

5. The patch is also signed-off by Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

6. The patch modifies the file drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c.

7. In the code changes, the line `free_irq(adev->irq[0], ldata->rtc);` is modified to `free_irq(adev->irq[0], ldata);`, passing the correct pointer to free_irq().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug by passing the correct pointer to free_irq(). It does not contain any trivial fixes and is signed-off by multiple individuals, including the author and maintainers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "hwmon: (f75375s) Fix bit shifting in f75375_write16". It suggests a fix for a bit shifting issue in the f75375_write16 function of the f75375s hardware monitoring driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the existing line of code in the f75375_write16 function. It changes the bit shifting operation from left shift (<<) to right shift (>>).

3. Analysis:
   The original code performs a left shift operation (value << 8) to extract the high byte of the 16-bit word. However, the patch suggests that the correct operation should be a right shift (value >> 8).

   This indicates that there was an error in the original code, where the high byte was being incorrectly extracted. The patch aims to fix this issue by using the correct right shift operation.

4. Impact:
   The incorrect bit shifting operation in the original code could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior when writing 16-bit values. By fixing this issue, the patch ensures that the correct high byte is extracted, preventing any potential data corruption.

5. Triviality:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real bug that could cause data corruption.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real bug that could lead to data corruption and does not contain any trivial changes.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the firmware code on exynos mcpm systems. It aims to stop relying on the code provided by the bootloader and instead use the kernel's own code for bringing up secondary CPUs.

2. The patch mentions that older bootloaders might have put slightly different code into the location where the firmware expects the kernel's entry point for secondary CPUs. By using the kernel's own code, this potential problem is fixed.

3. The patch includes a simple code jump to the kernel, which is a more reliable approach than relying on the bootloader's code.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including Doug Anderson, Kevin Hilman, and Nicolas Pitre.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the firmware code on exynos mcpm systems. It does not introduce any trivial changes and has received positive reviews. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new functions `task_ppid_nr_ns()` and `task_ppid_nr()` to abstract the lookup of the PPID (real_parent's pid_t) of a process, including rcu locking, in the arbitrary and init_pid_ns. These functions provide an alternative to `sys_getppid()`, which is relative to the child process' pid namespace.

This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding new functionality rather than addressing an existing issue.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to the transmission handling in the dw_mmc driver.

The patch addresses this issue by removing the setting of EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE after the IDMAC interrupt and suggests setting it after the DTO interrupt is generated.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a lock-up, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the ARM architecture related to the emit_udiv() function in the bpf_jit_32.c file.

2. The issue occurs when emit_udiv() is called with rn == ARM_R0 (r_scratch), and rm is loaded into ARM_R0 before rn. This results in jit_udiv() being called with the same dividend and divisor.

3. The patch proposes to fix this by loading rn first into ARM_R1 and then loading rm into ARM_R0.

4. The patch includes comments explaining the register overlap issues for different BPF_ALU | BPF_DIV | BPF_K and BPF_ALU | BPF_DIV | BPF_X instructions.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the ARM architecture and the emit_udiv() function. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the order of register loading to avoid register overlap issues.

The patch initializes the tbl_tcam_data structure to avoid this issue.

Since the patch fixes a build error and addresses a potential bug that could lead to uninitialized data usage, it should be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the SP (Spatial Reuse Protocol) in the mac80211 subsystem.

2. The issue is described as follows: When a frame is enqueued during the SP and carries the IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP bit, the SP may never be closed (WLAN_STA_SP will never be cleared). This can prevent the opening of new SPs and the response to poll frames from the client.

3. The patch manually clears the WLAN_STA_SP flag if a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU (Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit) session. This ensures that even if the client does not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

4. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Alesya Shapira, and signed-off-by tags from Emmanuel Grumbach and Johannes Berg.

5. The patch also removes an erroneous comment.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to the SP in the mac80211 subsystem. It prevents a potential hang or data corruption scenario by manually clearing the WLAN_STA_SP flag when necessary. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread. Currently, if usb-stor-scan freezes, another thread waiting on scanning to complete may fail to freeze. To avoid this, the patch introduces changes to usb-stor-scan.

The patch replaces the use of set_freezable() with set_freezable_with_signal() to request a fake signal when freezing. This ensures that the freezer will wait for usb-stor-scan to exit, and threads waiting for scanning to finish will no longer be blocked.

Additionally, the patch replaces wait_event_freezable_timeout() with wait_event_interruptible_timeout() to avoid freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread. This is necessary to prevent khubd from failing to freeze and causing a hang when suspending devices.

Overall, the patch addresses a critical issue related to freezing and ensures proper functionality without introducing any trivial changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "v4l2-compat-ioctl32: fix alignment for ARM64". It suggests that the patch aims to fix an alignment issue specific to ARM64 architecture.

2. The patch includes changes to the struct `v4l2_standard32`. It replaces the `id` field, which was an array of two `__u32` elements, with a single `compat_u64` element. This change ensures proper alignment on ARM64 kernels without breaking compatibility on AMD64.

3. The patch also modifies the `put_v4l2_standard32` function to use `put_user` instead of `copy_to_user` for the `id` field. This change aligns with the new `compat_u64` type used in the struct.

4. Additionally, the patch includes changes to the struct `v4l2_input32`. It replaces the `std` field, which was of type `v4l2_std_id`, with a `compat_u64` type. This change ensures proper alignment on ARM64 kernels.

5. The patch also removes the `__attribute__ ((packed))` attribute from the `v4l2_input32` struct. This change suggests that the struct should no longer be packed.

6. Finally, the patch includes changes to the struct `v4l2_event32`. It adds a new field `compat_s64 value64` to the union `u`. This change suggests that the patch aims to handle 64-bit values in a compatible manner.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses an alignment issue specific to ARM64 architecture and ensures compatibility with AMD64.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the flush_tlb_range() function. The patch adds the necessary locking mechanism to ensure that the page_table_lock is held when the mmap_sem is not held. This is important because some page table flushing instances explicitly work with page tables.

The patch also mentions that all other callers already hold either mmap_sem (exclusive) or page_table_lock, except for this specific caller. It further explains that almost all callers are fine, and flush_tlb_range() can safely work with page tables.

Considering the patch addresses a specific issue related to locking and ensures proper synchronization, it seems to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a NULL pointer dereference crash on POWER7 systems. The bug occurs when trying to allocate an HPT (Hash Page Table) in the case where no HPTs were preallocated and the free_linears list is empty.

The patch addresses this issue by using a separate variable, "ret," to store the return value from the loop iterator instead of using "ri" directly. It also correctly initializes the "ret" variable to NULL before the loop. Additionally, it includes a necessary memset operation on "ri->base_virt" to ensure proper initialization.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a critical issue that could lead to crashes and data corruption, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

This bug fix is not trivial as it addresses a subtle issue that can disable synchronization when the upper 32 bits of the semaphore value are not zero. Therefore, it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fact that it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the file permission of "split_huge_pages" in the debugfs from 0644 to 0200. This change restricts the permission to write-only, as the get method is not supported. This modification aligns the permission with the functionality of the code.

2. The patch also adds a newline character ("\n") to the output of the set method. This improves the readability of the output.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a minor issue related to file permissions and improves the readability of the output. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in this patch can be considered trivial.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the function `tcp_v4_md5_do_add()` in `net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c` and the function `tcp_v6_md5_do_add()` in `net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c`.

2. The patch addresses an issue where `tcp_v4_clear_md5_list()` assumes that multiple TCP MD5 signature peers only hold one reference to `md5sig_pool`. However, `tcp_v4_md5_do_add()` increases the use count of `md5sig_pool` for each peer.

3. The patch modifies `tcp_v4_md5_do_add()` to only increase the use count for the first TCP MD5 signature peer.

4. Similarly, the patch modifies `tcp_v6_md5_do_add()` to only increase the use count for the first TCP MD5 signature peer.

5. The patch also includes some changes related to memory allocation and freeing in both `tcp_v4_md5_do_del()` and `tcp_v6_md5_do_del()`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of MD5 signatures in TCP. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "btrfs: fix deadlock in delayed_ref_async_start" and provides a fix for a deadlock issue in the delayed_ref_async_start function in the btrfs file system.

2. The commit message explains that the previous implementation was deadlocking on btrfs_attach_transaction, which is not safe to call from the async delayed ref start code. This commit brings back btrfs_join_transaction instead and checks for a blocked commit.

3. The patch includes changes to the delayed_ref_async_start function in the extent-tree.c file.

4. The patch first checks if the commit is already started by calling btrfs_transaction_blocked. If it is, the function exits without further processing.

5. If the commit is not already started, the patch calls btrfs_join_transaction to join the transaction associated with the async->root.

6. If btrfs_join_transaction returns an error, the async->error variable is set to the error value, and the function exits.

7. If the transaction is successfully joined, the patch sets trans->sync to true and checks if the transaction ID is greater than the async->transid. If it is, the function jumps to the "end" label, skipping the delayed ref flushing.

8. If the transaction ID is not greater than async->transid, the patch calls btrfs_run_delayed_refs to flush the delayed refs.

9. If btrfs_run_delayed_refs returns an error, the async->error variable is set to the error value.

10. Finally, the patch calls btrfs_end_transaction to end the transaction and sets async->error to the return value if it is non-zero.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue (deadlock) and provides a fix by changing the transaction handling in the delayed_ref_async_start function. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the ARCNET driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch description states that it fixes a hard_header_len limit issue in the ARCNET driver. This suggests that there might be a bug causing incorrect header length calculation.

2. The patch explains that the struct archdr, which is currently used to determine the hard_header_len, contains a union of possible soft headers. However, when certain packets are inserted, they might not include soft headers or have short soft headers.

3. To address this issue, the patch proposes using the struct arc_hardware instead of archdr to determine the hard_header_len for an ARCNET device.

4. The patch modifies the dev->hard_header_len assignment in the arcdev_setup function to use sizeof(struct arc_hardware) instead of sizeof(struct archdr).

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific bug related to header length calculation in the ARCNET driver. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves changing the struct used for header length determination. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The bug can lead to a build error, an oops, or a hang: The provided reproduction path demonstrates that the bug triggers a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an internal error (Oops) and a kernel crash.

3. The patch fixes the issue: It prevents the null pointer dereference by checking if 'opts->id' is NULL before attempting to copy it to the 'page' buffer. If 'opts->id' is NULL, it sets 'page[0]' to 0 (empty string) and returns 0.

4. The fix does not contain trivial changes: The patch addresses a genuine bug and does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a critical bug that can lead to a kernel crash and does not contain any trivial changes.

1. Line 1926: The DP_AUDIO_OUTPUT_ENABLE bit is cleared by performing a bitwise AND operation with the complement of DP_AUDIO_OUTPUT_ENABLE. This ensures that the bit is disabled.
2. The updated value is written to the intel_dp->output_reg register.
3. A delay of intel_dp->panel_power_down_delay milliseconds is introduced using msleep().

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to hot removal of DP monitors and ensures that the audio driver is notified correctly. However, it does not fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it does not address any critical issues. As per the guidelines, patches containing trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) - this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to passing arbitrary data to the sideband interface in the DRM driver for Intel DSI panels. The change restricts the data passed to the sideband interface to only the least significant bit (bitwise AND with 1).

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, it addresses a potential issue with passing arbitrary data to the sideband interface, which could have unintended consequences.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - It does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the change is not trivial as it modifies the behavior of the code by restricting the data passed to the sideband interface.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a race condition between the connected_handler and the connection teardown flow in the iser-target driver.

2. The patch takes the isert_conn pointer from cm_id->qp->qp_context to ensure that the cm_id context is always the network portal. This makes the cm_id event check (connection or network portal) more reliable.

3. To avoid a NULL dereference in cma_id->qp->qp_context, the patch destroys the qp after destroying the cm_id, making the dereference safe. This is necessary because session establishment/teardown sequences can happen in parallel, and the connected_handler might race with the connection teardown flow.

4. The patch also protects the decrement of isert_conn->conn_device->active_qps within the error patch during QP creation failure and the normal teardown path in isert_connect_release().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to a race condition and ensures the reliability of the cm_id event check. It also includes necessary protections to avoid NULL dereferences and handle error scenarios correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for enabling the hotplug irq only if needed in the drm/i915 driver. The patch aims to avoid constant wakeups caused by noisy irq lines when the irq is not required. It also includes a fix for disabling sdvo hotplug on i945g/gm.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to counting used blocks on 32-bit architectures in the ext4 filesystem.
2. The issue is caused by potential overflow during arithmetic operations when adding delalloc blocks to the number of used blocks in the ext4_getattr() function.
3. The patch addresses the overflow issue by using a more appropriate type (unsigned long long) for the delalloc_blocks variable.
4. The patch also improves the arithmetic calculations by shifting the delalloc_blocks value by (inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits - 9) bits, instead of dividing by 512.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect counting of used blocks on 32-bit architectures. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted (ACK).

This allows other vcpus to get a scheduling boost, potentially releasing the lock more quickly and improving performance.

The patch also includes performance test results, showing a significant improvement in the 2x overcommit case, reducing the degradation from 40x to 1.5x. This indicates that the patch addresses a real performance issue.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and improving performance, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized variable warning in the crypto/algif_aead.c file. The patch initializes the "outlen" variable to zero to ensure that it is properly set even if the user provides insufficient data.

Since this patch addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a memory leak issue in the `populate_msi_sysfs()` function of the `drivers/pci/msi.c` file. The patch simply adds a `kfree(msi_attrs)` statement to free the allocated memory before returning from the function.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "r8169: corrupted IP fragments fix for large mtu." It suggests that the patch addresses a bug related to corrupted IP fragments when using a large MTU size.

2. Reported-by: The bug was reported by Nick Bowler, indicating that it is a real issue that has been identified.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Francois Romieu, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

4. Cc: The patch is also copied to Hayes Wang, suggesting that the relevant stakeholders are aware of the fix.

5. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch involve modifying the functions `rtl_hw_jumbo_enable` and `rtl_hw_jumbo_disable`. The changes involve acquiring and releasing a lock (`Cfg9346`) before and after performing certain operations.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to corrupted IP fragments when using a large MTU size. The patch also includes necessary code changes to fix the issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data sign in the iio: st_pressure driver. The patch changes the sign of the pressure and temperature data from unsigned ('u') to signed ('s') to align with the datasheet specifications of the devices (lps331ap, lps25h, lps001wp, lps22hb).

Since this patch addresses a critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect data interpretation, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. The Fixes tags indicate that this patch resolves issues introduced by previous patches, further supporting its importance.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch forces the function `kernel_init_freeable()` to be marked as `noinline` to reduce code bloat. Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it fixes an incorrect condition in determining the last logical address (last_la) used for the initial attempt at claiming a logical address.

2. The patch modifies the code in the cec_config_thread_func() function in the file drivers/media/cec/cec-adap.c.

3. In the original code, the condition !(last_la & type2mask[type]) is used to check if the last_la is valid for the given type. However, this condition is incorrect because it does not convert last_la to a mask before performing the AND operation.

4. The patch modifies the condition to !((1 << last_la) & type2mask[type]) to correctly convert last_la to a mask and perform the AND operation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug in the code that could lead to incorrect logical address determination. This bug does not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the correct functioning of the logical address determination.

true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an error seen on G5 iMac related to the nouveau driver.
2. The error message indicates a failure to create a kernel channel.
3. The patch modifies the nouveau_bo.c file in the drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau directory.
4. The change is related to the AGP aperture mapping.
5. The patch checks if the AGP aperture can be mapped by the CPU.
6. If the aperture can be mapped, the "is_iomem" flag is set to true.
7. The patch includes a reference to a Bugzilla entry for further information.
8. It also includes a "Reviewed-by" tag from Michel Dänzer and "Signed-off-by" tags from Aaro Koskinen and Dave Airlie.
9. The patch is also marked for consideration in the stable kernel releases.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a failure to create a kernel channel. It addresses a specific issue seen on G5 iMac and modifies the relevant code to check and set the "is_iomem" flag correctly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a printk statement and assigns the value of "op.value" to the "err" variable. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of strncpy to strscpy in the orangefs_inode_getattr function in the file orangefs-utils.c.

2. The patch addresses a potential issue where a rogue client-core could send a symlink target that is not null-terminated. This could result in corrupt data and cause an EIO error.

3. The patch uses strscpy instead of strncpy to copy the link target, which has a maximum length defined by ORANGEFS_NAME_MAX.

4. If the strscpy function returns -E2BIG, indicating that the link target is too long, the patch sets the return value to -EIO and jumps to the "out" label.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue that could lead to data corruption and ensures that the link target is properly null-terminated.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled for the ext4 filesystem. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Since the patch does not explicitly mention any specific bug or issue it addresses, we need to analyze the code changes to determine its impact.

The code change itself adds a check to enable journal checksumming if metadata checksumming is enabled. This change seems to be a logical and necessary step to ensure consistency between metadata and journal checksumming.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for an existing problem. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a panic due to an inability to handle a kernel paging request. The bug is related to the qlcnic driver and specifically the qlcnic_release_tx_buffers function.

The patch modifies the for loop in the function, changing the loop counter initialization from 0 to 1. This change ensures that the Tx frag being released is properly mapped before freeing it, preventing the panic.

Given that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a system crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a build error in the ARM architecture for the imx6q_sabrelite board. The error occurs when building with a modular phylib, resulting in an undeclared identifier error for 'ksz9021rn_phy_fixup'. 

This issue can cause a build error, which is a real and critical bug. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a regression introduced by commit 5ed0bdf21a85d78e04f89f15ccf227562177cbd9, which changed the behavior of negative timeouts in the WAIT_IOCTL function in the i915 driver.

2. The previous behavior of negative timeouts was to wait indefinitely, but the regression caused negative timeouts to return immediately.

3. The patch includes a testcase (igt/gem_wait) and references a bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89494), indicating that it addresses a real issue.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Chris Wilson, Daniel Vetter, Ben Widawsky, and Kristian Høgsberg.

5. The patch also includes a fix for a checkpatch complaint about whitespace, which shows attention to code quality.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression, addresses a real issue, has been reviewed, and includes a testcase.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The HIH6130/1 sensor requires zero-length data transfers to start a measurement, but some I2C bus drivers do not allow this. The patch proposes a workaround by writing a zero dummy byte, which has been verified to work with the OMAP I2C bus driver on a BeagleBone board.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes: It introduces a new variable, "write_length," to handle the length of the I2C measurement request.

3. The patch does not introduce any security issues or data corruption risks.

4. The patch does not cause build errors, oops, hangs, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, considering the nature of the bug and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the probe function in the Bluetooth driver. The current implementation returns the value returned by hci_register_dev(), which is the HCI index. However, this can cause issues on systems where the btwilink device has an ID larger than 0.

The proposed fix changes the return value of the probe function to 0 on success. This ensures consistent behavior across systems and avoids potential problems.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue that could lead to problems on certain systems, but it does not fall into the category of a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch titled "net: davinci_emac: Add support for emac on dm816x" appears to add support for the emac (Ethernet MAC) controllers on the dm816x platform. It includes changes to the davinci_emac.c file and the devicetree bindings for the davinci_emac interface.

Looking at the changes, it seems that the patch adds support for the dm816x platform by introducing a new compatible string "ti,dm816-emac" in the davinci_emac_of_match array. It also defines a new emac_platform_data structure for dm816x, indicating the version of the EMAC.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any significant issues. The patch seems to be adding support for a new platform, which may not fall under the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless there is additional information indicating that it addresses a critical bug, security issue, or other significant problems.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "s390/kdump: Clear subchannel ID to signal non-CCW/SCSI IPL". 

The patch description explains that there are use cases where an intermediate boot kernel uses kexec to boot the final production kernel. In this scenario, the original boot information should be provided to the production kernel. Therefore, clearing the boot information during kexec should not be done.

Looking at the code changes, the lines that clear the subchannel ID and number have been removed. These lines were previously used to signal the new kernel that no CCW or SCSI IPL has been done during kexec and kdump.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is reverting a change that is necessary for specific use cases involving kexec and kdump. Without further context or information about the impact of this change, it is difficult to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the reasons behind the original commit and the implications of reverting it. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if there have been any reported issues or regressions caused by the original commit.

Without this additional information, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the context is required to make a definitive decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be addressing a specific erratum related to the P2020/P2010 processors. The erratum, known as eTSEC 20, causes excess delays when transmitting large frames with TOE (TCP/IP hardware accelerations) enabled. This issue was fixed in Revision 2.0 of the processors.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to meet the requirements. It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause delays in transmitting large frames with TOE enabled. It is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a race condition between URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer, potentially leading to an oops in certain scenarios.

The patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue() function to remove TDs from the TD lists and canceled TD lists before giving back the URB. It also includes additional changes in various functions to ensure proper removal of TDs from the lists.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause an oops and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture in the KVM module. The patch addresses a potential problem with accessing guest code during MMIO load completion, which could lead to reading the branch instruction from host user memory instead. 

The patch calculates the resume PC in advance and saves it in the vcpu->arch.io_pc field. It then restores this value on MMIO completion. Additionally, the patch removes the no longer needed vcpu->arch.pending_load_cause field.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it fixes a potential issue related to guest code access, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to interrupt timeout handling in the net/mvmdio driver. The patch ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, which guarantees that wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a hang or data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, so it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to handling power-gating for the VCE (Video Codec Engine) block in the AMDGPU driver. 

The patch checks if the power-gating support for VCE is enabled before attempting to start or stop the VCE block. If power-gating support is disabled, the function returns without performing any actions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a code improvement related to power-gating handling.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch initializes the network_header and transport_header in the skb created in vnet_rx_one() function.

2. It checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag set. If it does, and the protocol of the skb is ETH_P_IP, it sets the checksum field of the IP header to 0 and recalculates the IP checksum.

3. It checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag set and the skb's ip_summed field is CHECKSUM_NONE. If both conditions are true, it further checks if the protocol of the skb is ETH_P_IP.

4. If the protocol is ETH_P_IP, it resets the transport header of the skb and sets it to the correct offset based on the IP header length (ihl). Then, it calls the vnet_fullcsum() function to compute the checksum for the IPv4 packet.

5. Finally, it checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM_OK flag set and sets the skb's ip_summed field to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and csum_level to 0.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to checksum calculation for IPv4 packets in the sunvnet driver. It ensures that the network_header and transport_header are properly initialized and that the checksum is correctly computed. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload). The bug occurs when the buffer is within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of a 4G boundary. The patch introduces a workaround to detect and handle this condition.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific hardware issue that can lead to data corruption, it qualifies as a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch simply moves the call to `omap_hsmmc_context_save()` to a different location within the `omap_hsmmc_probe()` function. This change does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a double fetch bug in the ioctl function of the cros_ec_dev driver. This bug could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" change between the two copy_from_user() calls.

2. The patch improves security: By verifying that the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" have not changed, the patch prevents potential buffer overflows, which can be a security vulnerability.

3. The patch fixes a potential data corruption issue: The patch ensures that the correct value of "s_cmd->insize" is used, even if cros_ec_cmd_xfer() sets it to a lower value. This prevents copying too much data to the user, avoiding potential data corruption.

4. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reviewed by Kees Cook and tested by Gwendal Grignou, which adds confidence in its correctness and effectiveness.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a real and critical bug and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a merge error and initializes a missing variable. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to an information leak in AUDIT_GET requests. The patch initializes the "mask" member of the "status_set" structure to zero, which prevents the leakage of 4 bytes of kernel stack.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information leakage, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in block/blk-ioc.c.
2. The reverse double lock dancing in ioc_release_fn() is replaced with a trylock on the queue_lock. If the trylock fails, it backs out from the ioc lock and releases the queue lock.
3. The patch removes the need for tracking the last_q variable and simplifies the code by directly using the icq->q variable.
4. The ioc_exit_icq() function is called to exit the icq.
5. The patch unlocks the queue lock and restores the ioc lock.
6. Finally, the ioc_release_fn() function frees the memory allocated for the io_context structure.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to simplify the code and improve the locking mechanism in ioc_release_fn(). However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to be a "trivial" fix that simplifies the code without addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to event processing delay and potential data halt and disconnection on the AP interface. The patch requeues work after a scan is completed for all VIF types, ensuring that event processing is not delayed for the AP interface when it coexists with a STA.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and disconnection, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of btrfs_page_exists_in_range uses the incorrect type for page indices, which can lead to unexpected failures and incorrect results.

2. The bug can cause issues in various scenarios, including hole punching and direct locking, where it is crucial to ensure that there are no pages in the specified range.

3. The bug can result in false negatives, where the function incorrectly returns false even though there is at least one page in the range.

4. The bug has specific constraints for practical occurrence, including large file size, crossing the 16TiB boundary, and matching internal state of file pages and pending operations.

5. The worst consequence of the bug seems to be stale data reads, which can be problematic but may not directly lead to build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption.

Considering these points, while the bug may not directly cause the most severe issues, it does impact critical functionality and can lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, it is advisable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and correctness of the btrfs filesystem.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix an issue in the KVM virtual interrupt controller (vgic) code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses a problem where the active state of an interrupt is checked incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior when external inputs need to access the state of a virtual interrupt.

2. Reported-by and Acked-by: The patch has been reported by Eric Auger and Acked by Marc Zyngier, indicating that the issue has been identified and verified by multiple individuals.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Christoffer Dall and Marc Zyngier, indicating their agreement with the patch's content and its suitability for inclusion.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the kvm_vgic_map_is_active() function in the vgic.c file. It replaces the existing call to dist_active_irq() with a new function vgic_irq_is_active(), passing the virtual IRQ as an argument.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug in the KVM virtual interrupt controller code. It has been reported, acknowledged, and signed-off by relevant individuals. The code changes seem appropriate for fixing the issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a real bug related to memory leaks in the HID multitouch driver. The function `mt_free_input_name()` was not being called during the `.remove()` operation, leading to a memory leak. The patch fixes this issue by restoring the original name before freeing it to avoid accessing an already freed pointer.

The bug was introduced by commit 49a5a827a, which appended "Pen" to the name of the stylus input. However, this change caused the allocated names to not be freed properly, resulting in a regression.

The patch includes the necessary changes to properly free the allocated names and prevent memory leaks. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real bug that can lead to memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue where allocating new chunks fails when considering missing devices. It explains that the current code allocates new chunks based on the number of writable devices and missing devices to honor RAID levels on a degraded file system. However, this approach prevents the allocation of new chunks when there are not enough writable devices available. The patch proposes to fix this by ignoring the number of missing devices when allocating new chunks.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies two functions: `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` and `update_block_group_flags`. In both functions, the code that adds the count of missing devices to the number of writable devices is removed. Instead, only the number of writable devices is used.

3. Impact Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to allocating new chunks in a degraded file system. It ensures that new chunks can be allocated even if there are missing devices, allowing for higher RAID levels. The issue can be reproduced by following the provided steps.

4. Criticality Assessment:
   Based on the provided information, the issue does not seem to cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues as it prevents the allocation of new chunks in certain scenarios. While not critical, it can impact the functionality and performance of the file system.

Considering the above analysis, I would classify this patch as a (B) "should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK)". Although it addresses an issue, it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the issue it addresses is not severe enough to warrant inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the lightnvm subsystem in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch allows the media manager to be initialized without a storage backend. This change seems to be a functional improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug.

2. It fixes incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, as it does not support the get/set bad block interface. This fix addresses a specific issue in the null_blk driver and does not seem to be critical or security-related.

3. The changes in the null_lnvm_id function modify the capabilities of the device. The change from `id->cap = 0x3` to `id->cap = 0x2` suggests a modification in the device's capabilities, but without further context, it is difficult to determine the significance of this change.

4. In the nvm_register function, the patch adds a condition to check if the device supports bad block management before attempting to initialize the system block. This change seems to be a defensive measure to avoid unnecessary initialization if the device does not support bad block management.

5. In the __nvm_ioctl_dev_init function, a similar condition is added to check if the device supports bad block management before initializing the system block. This change aligns with the previous modification and ensures that the initialization is only performed if the device supports it.

6. The nvm_ioctl_dev_factory function also includes a condition to check if the device supports bad block management before calling nvm_dev_factory. This change ensures that the factory operation is only performed if the device supports it.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch does not address a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of a functional improvement and a fix for specific issues in the lightnvm subsystem and the null_blk driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing iounmap in the probe error path of the rtc-at91rm9200 driver. This fix is necessary to prevent resource leaks and potential issues with the Real Time Clock (RTC) driver on the AT91RM9200 platform.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a fix for a missing iounmap, which can be considered a trivial fix.

true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that there is an invalid buffer lookup in the mtk_tx_map() function, which appears to be a copy & paste error. The code needs to be changed to use the correct pointer.

2. Looking at the patch itself, it modifies the line where the incorrect descriptor pointer is used in the error path. It replaces "txd" with "itxd" to use the correct pointer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug in the code by correcting the incorrect descriptor pointer. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch aims to optimize the irq restore process in the s390 architecture.
2. It replaces the existing __arch_local_irq_ssm() function with __arch_local_irq_stosm() for restoring interrupts.
3. The comment states that irqsave/irqrestore only deals with external and I/O interrupts.
4. It mentions that irqrestore can transition only from disabled->disabled or disabled->enabled.
5. The patch introduces a new macro, ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED, which represents the enabled state of interrupts.
6. The arch_local_irq_restore() function is modified to check if the flags indicate a transition from disabled->enabled and calls arch_local_irq_enable() accordingly.
7. The arch_irqs_disabled_flags() function is modified to use the new ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED macro for checking if interrupts are disabled.
8. The patch also modifies the paging_init() function in arch/s390/mm/init.c to use __arch_local_irq_stosm() instead of arch_local_irq_restore().

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It optimizes the irq restore process by using a faster instruction and ensures that the irqrestore operation is only performed when transitioning from disabled->enabled. This patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical issue related to interrupt handling in the s390 architecture.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to interrupt flags on the Rx LL2 in the qed driver.

2. The problem is that the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

3. The patch fixes this issue by passing a pointer to the lock_flags variable to qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() and using it to unlock and re-lock the spinlock.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect interrupt status. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by commit b0d0d915 in the ipx module. The regression causes a deadlock when a recvmsg syscall blocks waiting for new data, preventing any data from being sent on the same socket with sendmsg. This issue specifically affects the mars-nwe (NetWare emulator) functionality.

The patch addresses the problem by only keeping the socket locked while working with the socket data and releasing it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram(). It also introduces a boolean variable "locked" to track the lock status and ensures that the socket is only released if it was locked in the first place.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock and impacts the functionality of the mars-nwe emulator. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a fix for a potential issue in the scheduler's NUMA task selection.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the contamination of the percpu pointer with the DEAD flag. The bug can occur if __ref_is_percpu() races with percpu_ref_kill() and sees the DEAD flag without the ATOMIC flag. The proposed fix updates __ref_is_percpu() to test both the ATOMIC and DEAD flags together before returning the percpu pointer.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that can potentially lead to incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the code is removing a check that restricts the minimum length of I/O operations in the nfsd/blocklayout module. The comment in the code suggests that the restriction is not in line with the specifications outlined in RFC 5661 section 18.43.3.

The patch also mentions that recent Linux clients have started sending GETLAYOUT requests with minlength less than blocksize, which has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some clients.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue that can cause hangs on certain clients. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:
