non-security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP). 

The patch addresses an issue related to the 'max_part' parameter in the nbd (Network Block Device) module. It limits the number of maximum partitions a nbd device can have. The problem is that if a user specifies a very large value for 'max_part', it can exceed the limitation of the device minor number and potentially cause a kernel oops or produce invalid device nodes.

The patch modifies the code to check if the specified 'max_part' value is within a valid range and returns an error (-EINVAL) if it exceeds the limit. This change ensures that the system remains stable and prevents potential issues caused by invalid device nodes.

While this patch improves the functionality and stability of the nbd module, it does not directly address any security vulnerabilities or exploits. Therefore, it can be classified as a non-security patch (NSP).
