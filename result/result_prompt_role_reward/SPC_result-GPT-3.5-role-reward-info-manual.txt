false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro for the of_ipmi_match symbol. This change allows the ipmi module to be autoloaded when using device tree.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only updates the wording of error messages in the s390/dasd driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, wording updates), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the incorrect usage of the dev_id argument in the bcmgenet_open() function's error path. The patch correctly updates the argument passed to the free_irq() function to match the one used in the request_irq() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially cause issues such as oops or data corruption, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a public declaration for the function `gb_interface_destroy()`. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for z13 architecture-specific facilities in the s390 architecture. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check to reject version and minorversion changes on remount attempts in the NFS (Network File System) code.

2. It includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the bug was reported by Eric Doutreleau.

3. It is signed-off by Jeff Layton and Trond Myklebust, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch modifies the function `nfs_compare_remount_data` in the `fs/nfs/super.c` file. It compares various parameters (`flags`, `rsize`, `wsize`, `version`, `minorversion`, etc.) between the existing NFS server and the remount data.

5. If any of the compared parameters differ, the remount attempt is rejected.

6. The patch also modifies the `nfs_remount` function in the same file. It sets the `version` and `minorversion` parameters of the remount data to the corresponding values from the NFS server.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to version and minorversion changes on remount attempts in the NFS code. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the comparison and setting of parameters.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a sparse error by accessing __iomem directly. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug enhancement rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The changes made in this patch are adding debug messages using the BT_DBG macro in the l2cap_sock_shutdown() and __l2cap_wait_ack() functions.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address duplicated callback functions in the codec driver and component driver for the ssm2518 codec.
2. The duplicated functions were initially copied from the codec driver to the component driver during register timing.
3. The patch proposes moving these functions from the codec driver to the component driver.
4. The changes are made in the "ssm2518_codec_driver" structure, specifically in the "controls," "num_controls," "dapm_widgets," "num_dapm_widgets," "dapm_routes," and "num_dapm_routes" fields.
5. The functions are moved to the "component_driver" structure within the "ssm2518_codec_driver" structure.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a code duplication issue and improving the organization of the code by moving the functions to the appropriate driver. However, it does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the changes seem to be more of a code cleanup rather than addressing a significant issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a build warning. The warning is related to a function `tegra_kbc_set_keypress_interrupt` being defined but not used. This warning is not critical and does not indicate any real bug or issue that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding pin groups for QSPI (Quad SPI) functionality to the sh-pfc driver for the r8a7791 platform. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds support for QSPI pin groups, which can be considered as a new feature or enhancement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes reliance on the CONFIG_MEMORY_START configuration option. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the data type of the `pci_addr_phys` variable from `unsigned long` to `phys_addr_t` and updates the log format accordingly. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function and updates its references. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is a simple renaming of a function to match the naming pattern of other SMP operations.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch primarily replaces the usage of `atomic_inc` and `atomic_dec_and_test` with `rvt_get_qp` and `rvt_put_qp` functions for managing the reference counters of QPs (Queue Pairs).

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and only introduces a minor code change for maintainability purposes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new function called "dpm_for_each_dev" in the power management subsystem. This function allows iterating over devices in the dpm_list and calling a provided callback function for each device.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: enable DMA for SDHI0"
   - This patch aims to enable DMA for SDHI0 on the shmobile bockw board.

2. Patch changes:
   - The patch adds two lines of code to the sdhi0_info structure in the board-bockw.c file.
   - The added lines specify the DMA slave IDs for the SDHI0 controller.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch enables DMA for the SDHI0 controller on the shmobile bockw board.
   - It passes the HPB-DMA slave IDs in the SDHI0 platform data to enable DMA in the SDHI driver.
   - Enabling DMA can improve performance and reduce CPU overhead for data transfers.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if enabling DMA for SDHI0 on the shmobile bockw board is considered a real and critical bug fix or improvement.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using variables. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch adjusts the chunk size for metadata on larger filesystems. While this change may optimize performance, it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes an obsoleted check in the ext4 file system's namei.c file.
2. The comment in the patch mentions that the BH (buffer head) cannot be NULL at this point because ext4_read_dirblock() always returns a non-null value.
3. It also states that all necessary checks have already been performed.
4. The patch is signed-off by Dmitry Monakhov and Theodore Ts'o.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch removes a redundant check that is no longer needed. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple conditional modification in the ath9k_hw_reset() function in the hw.c file of the ath9k driver. The patch checks if the MCI (Memory Controller Interface) is disabled before programming the OBS (Outbound Stream) register.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

From the patch itself, it is not explicitly clear what bug or issue it addresses. We can infer that it is related to the OBS register and the MCI, but without further context or explanation, it is difficult to assess the severity or impact of the bug being fixed.

To make an informed decision, we would need additional information such as the bug report or the rationale behind the patch. Without this information, it is not possible to determine whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, based solely on the provided patch, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) as there is insufficient information to confirm that it fixes a real and critical bug.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves replacing a single table with two different tables. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not seem to introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding DT (Device Tree) defines for co-processor reset lines in the STi ARM platform. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a sparse warning in the `tuntap` driver. The change makes the `tun_enable_queue()` function static, which resolves the sparse warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes two unused fields from the autofs_sb_info structure. These fields were left behind from a previous commit that removed unused ioctls.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "brcmsmac: fix DMA on SoCs" which suggests that it addresses a specific issue related to DMA on System-on-Chips (SoCs).

2. The patch includes a partial revert of a previous commit (821e4e93172e4f7d5ac1eade04665c3dc5049c4a) that removed unused bus code from softmac. This indicates that the patch is undoing a previous change.

3. The patch is signed-off by Hauke Mehrtens and Acked-by Arend van Spriel, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

4. The code changes in the patch modify the `dma_attach` function in the `dma.c` file of the `brcmsmac` driver.

5. The changes involve adding conditional logic to set `ddoffsetlow` and `ddoffsethigh` values based on the hosttype of the `icbus`. Specifically, if the hosttype is BCMA_HOSTTYPE_PCI, the offsets are set to specific values.

6. The changes also update `dataoffsetlow` and `dataoffsethigh` values based on the `ddoffsetlow` and `ddoffsethigh` values.

7. The patch includes a comment mentioning a specific workaround (WAR64450) for a particular condition related to the SDIOD core.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to DMA on SoCs and includes a partial revert of a previous commit. The changes seem to be targeted and relevant to the specific issue being addressed. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use PCI Express Capability access functions to simplify the ath9k driver.

2. The patch removes the usage of the `pci_pcie_cap` function and replaces it with the `pcie_capability_clear_word` and `pcie_capability_read_word` functions.

3. The patch also removes the usage of `pci_read_config_byte` and `pci_write_config_byte` functions and replaces them with `pcie_capability_clear_word` and `pcie_capability_read_word` functions.

4. The patch checks if the device is a PCI Express device using the `is_pciexpress` flag. If it is not, the function returns without making any changes.

5. If Bluetooth coexistence is enabled, the patch clears the ASPM (Active State Power Management) settings using the `pcie_capability_clear_word` function for both the current device and its parent device.

6. If Bluetooth coexistence is not enabled, the patch reads the ASPM settings using the `pcie_capability_read_word` function for the parent device and checks if L0s or L1 states are enabled. If they are, the `aspm_enabled` flag is set to true.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code improvement that simplifies the ath9k driver by using PCI Express Capability access functions.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a small inline wrapper for the `device_tx_status` callback of a DMA device. This change aims to make the code more compact and legible for users of this function.

However, since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "drm/i915/vlv: check port in infoframe_enabled v2" and suggests checking the port in the infoframe_enabled function for the VLV (Valleyview) platform.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by three developers: Jesse Barnes, Rodrigo Vivi, and Daniel Vetter.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the vlv_infoframe_enabled function in the intel_hdmi.c file.

4. Code Analysis: The patch introduces a new variable "intel_dig_port" of type "struct intel_digital_port" and initializes it with the encoder passed to the function. It also adds a new variable "port" of type "u32" to store the port value of the digital port.

5. The patch modifies the return statement of the function. It checks if the "port" matches the port value obtained from the register read, and if so, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between "val" and VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE. Otherwise, it returns false.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to checking the port in the infoframe_enabled function for the VLV platform. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces new variables and modifies the return statement. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the appropriate maintainers and reviewers to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `sch_generic.c` file in the `net/sched` directory.

2. The patch adds a check for the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag in two places:

   a. In the `attach_one_default_qdisc` function, it checks if `dev->tx_queue_len` is non-zero and `dev->priv_flags` does not have the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag set. If both conditions are true, it creates a default qdisc using `qdisc_create_dflt`.

   b. In the `attach_default_qdiscs` function, it checks if the device is not multi-queue (`!netif_is_multiqueue(dev)`) or if `dev->tx_queue_len` is zero or if `dev->priv_flags` has the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag set. If any of these conditions are true, it attaches a default qdisc to each tx queue of the device.

3. The patch also updates the `dev->qdisc` pointer to point to the `qdisc_sleeping` field of the first tx queue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch introduces a new behavior to handle the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero. This change allows for the creation of a default qdisc when `IFF_NO_QUEUE` is not set, and `tx_queue_len` is non-zero.

Since this patch addresses a specific behavior related to the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag and does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that switches the driver to use the module_platform_driver macro instead of manually defining the init and exit functions. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant "break" statements after "goto" statements. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing whitespace), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with unchecked allocations in the r8712u driver in the staging directory. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds error checking for the `dev_alloc_skb()` call in the `amsdu_to_msdu()` function. If the allocation fails (`sub_skb` is NULL), the patch breaks out of the loop. This is a good practice as it handles the failure case.

2. The patch also adds error checking for the `skb_clone()` call in the `recvbuf2recvframe()` function. If the clone fails (`precvframe->u.hdr.pkt` is NULL), the patch returns `_FAIL`. This ensures that the failure is properly handled.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses potential issues with unchecked allocations and adds appropriate error handling. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that makes the function `hp_amp_power_on` static. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the addition of codec controls in the ak4642_probe() function. The patch also adds the same controls to the soc_codec_dev_ak4648 structure. 

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes some code and duplicates the controls, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing newline character ("\n") to the end of two dev_err messages in the s390/dasd_erp.c file. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch modifies the code in the "drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns" directory. It introduces changes related to the usage of the "device_node" structure and replaces it with the "fwnode_handle" structure. The patch also updates function signatures and variable assignments accordingly.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. The patch seems to be more focused on code refactoring and using a more suitable method for device_node handling in the DT case.

Without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the given information, it appears that this patch may not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it does not seem to fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check. The patch removes the check for `dst == NULL` in the `if` condition and only checks for `dst->error`. 

Since `ip6_route_output()` is guaranteed to never return a NULL pointer, the check for `dst == NULL` is redundant and can be safely removed. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it is a code cleanup rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch switches over to the now exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers. This is a good practice as it ensures the use of standardized and maintained functions.

2. The patch removes the TODO item related to the TMU clocksource. This indicates that the patch addresses a long-standing issue, which is a positive sign.

3. The code block starting from line 245 to 250 is removed and replaced with a single line: `clockevents_config(ced, p->rate);`. This line configures the clock event device with the provided rate. It seems to be a valid and necessary change.

4. The code block starting from line 323 to 327 is modified. The line `clockevents_register_device(ced);` is removed, and instead, `clockevents_config_and_register(ced, 1, 0x300, 0xffffffff);` is used. This change configures and registers the clock event device with specific parameters.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the TMU clocksource and makes necessary changes to use the exported clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() functions. The changes seem valid and necessary for proper functionality.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for the staging iio drivers adis16209 and adis16240. The patch replaces the custom event handler functions `adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll` and `adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll` with the generic function `iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll`. 

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and it addresses a real bug in the drivers, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch fixes an uninitialized variable warning in the `ath9k_has_tx_pending()` function in the `ath9k` driver. The warning suggests that the variable `npend` may be used uninitialized in the function.

Since this warning indicates a potential issue that could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect program execution, it is not a trivial fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which are considered trivial.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues in the `ath9k` driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a new function called `calibration_delay_done()` with a dummy implementation. This function is used to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and can be used by architectures to stop accepting delay timer registrations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the i2c-brcmstb.c file in the drivers/i2c/busses directory.

2. The patch introduces a new helper function, i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg, which is used to calculate the 8-bit address from the message.

3. The existing code in the brcmstb_i2c_do_addr function is modified to use the new helper function instead of manually calculating the address.

4. The patch removes the previous code that shifted the address and set the read flag based on the message flags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a functional change to improve the handling of 8-bit addresses in the brcmstb_i2c_do_addr function. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused variable 'neigh' from the 'dn_output()' function in the 'dn_route.c' file of the DECnet subsystem. 

Since this patch only removes an unused variable and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for VB2_DMABUF in the davinci vpbe driver. However, without additional context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical problem. Additionally, I would need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch, and any other relevant details, so that I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a manual swapping operation with the `swap()` macro defined in `kernel.h`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves code readability and maintainability, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing superfluous address-of operators and unneeded casts. It also updates the printk format specifier to use %p for pointers.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), and it only contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the `ioctl` function with `unlocked_ioctl` in the `bcm2048_fops` structure. This change is specific to the `radio-bcm2048` driver and does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the variable name `PIDVEC_SIZE` to `max_items` in the `f2fs` file system's `gang_lookup_pids` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a simple renaming of a variable, which falls under the category of "trivial" fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant condition check. The condition `(oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID)` is already checked in the previous line, so there is no need to check it again. The patch simply removes the redundant check and updates the code accordingly.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()`. This change is in line with the driver-core's support for synchronous self-deletion of attributes and the removal of the asynchronous mechanism.

2. The patch ensures that the "delete" behavior is synchronous by directly calling `scsi_remove_device()` after removing the file using `device_remove_file_self()`. This simplifies the code and eliminates the need for the roundabout approach previously used.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these observations, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial cleanup that removes an unnecessary forward declaration. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any functional issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a local variable "handle" in the acpi_pci_root_add() function. This local variable is assigned the value of "device->handle" and is then used in place of "device->handle" throughout the function.

The purpose of this change seems to be to improve code readability and reduce redundancy by using the "handle" variable instead of repeatedly accessing "device->handle".

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential resource leak in the raumfeld_audio_init function. The patch adds a missing platform_device_put call in the error path when platform_device_add returns a negative value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential resource leak, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for the McASPs on the davinci dm646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and have corresponding IRQ numbers.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about a bug or issue that it resolves. It seems to be adding interrupt resources for error recovery, but without further context, it is difficult to assess the significance of this change.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. More details about the bug or issue it addresses would be necessary for a proper evaluation. Therefore, I would lean towards a (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) for now.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch only adds a conditional check before calling the function `snd_soc_of_parse_audio_routing()`. This check is based on the presence of the property "simple-audio-routing" in the device tree node.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only adds a conditional check for optional functionality, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for inconsistent indenting in the i915_error_state_to_str() function. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to add an option to skip sync on DMA map in the arch/avr32 folder. It mentions that the use of DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC was not consistent across all DMA APIs in the arch/arm folder, and this change is meant to correct that for consistent behavior.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `avr32_dma_map_page` and `avr32_dma_map_sg` functions in the `arch/avr32/mm/dma-coherent.c` file.

   In the `avr32_dma_map_page` function:
   - It adds a condition `if (!(attrs & DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC))` to check if the `DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC` attribute is not set.
   - If the condition is true, it calls `dma_cache_sync` to synchronize the CPU cache for the given `dev`, `cpu_addr`, `size`, and `direction`.

   In the `avr32_dma_map_sg` function:
   - It adds a condition `if (attrs & DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC)` to check if the `DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC` attribute is set.
   - If the condition is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop without calling `dma_cache_sync`.
   - Otherwise, it calls `dma_cache_sync` for each scatterlist entry.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to ensure consistent behavior by adding an option to skip the CPU cache synchronization during DMA mapping in the `avr32_dma_map_page` and `avr32_dma_map_sg` functions.

   However, without further context or information about the specific issues or bugs this patch addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues that it fixes.

   Therefore, based on the given information, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further analysis and context from the Linux kernel maintainers would be necessary to make a definitive decision.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review by the Linux kernel maintainers is recommended before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a calculation with the DIV_ROUND_UP macro. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a USB ID for the PCTV 340eSE device. This patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the name of a signal from "DE" to "DISP" in the rcar-du driver for the DRM subsystem. This change is made to clarify that the DISP pin outputs the DISP signal.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the IRQ handler function `bq27xxx_battery_irq_handler_thread` to the appropriate section in the code. This change resolves a warning related to the handler being defined but not used when the `CONFIG_BQ27XXX_I2C` configuration is not enabled.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes an indentation issue in the `struct amdgpu_ring` definition, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds a check of the status_code in ERSP_IU.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by James Smart, Sagi Grimberg, and Jens Axboe.

3. Reviewed-by: The patch has been reviewed by Johannes Thumshirn and Christoph Hellwig.

4. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch are as follows:
   - In the function `nvme_fc_fcpio_done`, a check is added for `op->rsp_iu.status_code`.
   - If the status_code is non-zero, the `status` variable is set to -EIO.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is adding a necessary check for the status_code in the ERSP_IU structure. This check is likely to address a potential issue related to the status of the operation. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the bug.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it appears to fix a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being fixed would be required for a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the private copy of `struct net_device_stats` in `struct port_info` and instead uses the stats from `struct net_device`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves removing a struct member and updating a pointer assignment.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `ipmmu_probe` function in the `shmobile-ipmmu.c` file.

2. The patch removes the `ipmmu_iommu_init(ipmmu);` line and replaces it with `return ipmmu_iommu_init(ipmmu);`.

3. The `ipmmu_iommu_init` function initializes the IPMMU IOMMU and can potentially fail.

4. By returning the result of `ipmmu_iommu_init(ipmmu)`, the patch ensures that the error value is not ignored.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue where the `ipmmu_iommu_init` function can fail, and it ensures that the error value is properly handled by returning it. This fix aligns with the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not take into account any potential interactions or dependencies with other parts of the Linux kernel.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new parameter "rw" to the function "__extent_read_full_page" in "extent_io.c". This parameter is used to specify the type of I/O operation (READ or WRITE). This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch modifies the function "extent_read_full_page" to pass the "rw" parameter to "__extent_read_full_page" and also adds the "REQ_META" flag to the "rw" parameter when calling "submit_one_bio". This change ensures that metadata I/O is properly tagged and avoids priority inversion when using I/O throttling cgroups. It addresses a potential issue related to metadata I/O and seems to fix a real and critical bug.

3. The patch modifies the function "write_one_eb" to include the "REQ_META" flag in the "rw" parameter when calling "submit_extent_page". This change ensures that metadata I/O is properly tagged during write operations. It seems to fix a real and critical bug related to metadata I/O.

4. The patch modifies the function "extent_readpages" to pass the "rw" parameter to "__extent_read_full_page" and also adds the "REQ_META" flag to the "rw" parameter when calling "submit_one_bio". This change ensures that metadata I/O is properly tagged during read operations. It seems to fix a real and critical bug related to metadata I/O.

5. The patch modifies the function "read_extent_buffer_pages" to include the "REQ_META" flag in the "rw" parameter when calling "__extent_read_full_page" and "submit_one_bio". This change ensures that metadata I/O is properly tagged during read operations. It seems to fix a real and critical bug related to metadata I/O.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to metadata I/O and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding initial support for the GP104 chipset in the Nouveau driver. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed, whether it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, and if it falls into one of the specified categories such as build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or other significant issues.

Please provide additional information or context about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for distinguishing between i.MX23 and i.MX28 SoC variants in the MXS touchscreen driver. This fix is necessary to make the touchscreen work on i.MX23.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a specific hardware differentiation fix.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix default UVD context size" and is signed-off by Christian König, reviewed by Leo Liu and Alex Deucher, and signed-off again by Alex Deucher.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the "amdgpu_uvd_cs_msg_decode" function in the "amdgpu_uvd.c" file.

3. The specific change is in the declaration of the "min_ctx_size" variable. Previously, it was initialized to 0, but now it is initialized to the maximum value of an unsigned integer (~0).

4. The purpose of this change is to set the default value of "min_ctx_size" to the maximum possible value, indicating that context buffers should be denied by default.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a default value issue related to UVD context size in the AMDGPU driver. While it may not directly address a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does fix an issue that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect default settings.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the ARM shmobile rcar-gen2 platform. It adds more register documentation and includes some changes to the register definitions and related code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:

   - It adds a warning when preliminary hardware support is not used.
   - It modifies the HALF_SLICE_CHICKEN3 register to enable the GEN8_CENTROID_PIXEL_OPT_DIS bit.

2. Patch Impact:
   - The patch addresses a specific bug and provides a workaround for BDW Bug #1899532.
   - It disables the centroid pixel performance optimization, which suggests that the optimization may cause issues or instability.
   - The warning added helps identify cases where preliminary hardware support is not used.

3. Patch Criteria:
   - The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unused code), I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces the define DEBUG_UART_SHIFT and removes the variable "shift" in all functions in uncompress.h. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary casting. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary operation. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds defines for exit codes in the kselftest framework. It does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues. 

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a struct in the drm/edid module. The patch does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not seem to fix any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the function `ath9k_hw_set_rfmode()` after `ath9k_hw_process_ini()` in the `ath9k_hw_chip_reset()` function.

2. The reason for this change is to avoid overwriting the `AR_PHY_MODE` register with default values by `ar9003_hw_process_ini()`.

3. The patch also adds a call to `ath9k_hw_set_rfmode()` after `ath9k_hw_init_pll()` in the `ath9k_hw_reset()` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the initialization of the AR9003 chip in the ath9k driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential data corruption issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a suspicious RCU usage warning in the net_sched module. The warning indicates a potential issue with RCU (Read-Copy-Update) usage in the code.

The patch modifies the tcindex_classify() function by changing the rcu_dereference() call to rcu_dereference_bh(). This change suggests that the patch addresses a potential race condition related to RCU usage in the function.

Since the patch fixes a real bug related to RCU usage and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the display of mount options in /proc/mounts for the cifs filesystem. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a message print when firmware fails to be requested in the case of platform data being used. This is a useful addition as it provides better visibility and debugging information for potential issues related to firmware requests.

2. The patch distinguishes between error messages for the device tree and platform data cases. This differentiation helps in identifying the source of the failure more accurately, which can be beneficial for troubleshooting and fixing the issue.

3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a real issue related to firmware request failure, which can potentially cause critical bugs or errors.

Considering these factors, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch fixes a potential kernel panic issue caused by a recursive recovery during boot. The patch checks the state of the wl->state variable before queuing a new recovery, ensuring that the recovery is only queued when the hardware is in the "on" state.

Considering that the issue addressed by the patch can potentially lead to a kernel panic, it can be classified as a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` status of the DCE (Display Core Engine) IP block accordingly.

2. The `dce_v10_0_soft_reset` function is modified to check if the DCE IP block is hung before performing a soft reset. If the IP block is not hung, the function returns without performing the reset.

3. The `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure is updated to include the new `check_soft_reset` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a check for display hang and updates the IP block status accordingly. This can be considered as a fix for a potential hang issue in the AMDGPU driver. Since a hang can cause system instability and impact user experience, this patch addresses a real and critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the `drm_proc_list` and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix involving spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the HID Wacom driver. The patch moves the report header check for the Wacom Graphire device to ensure that valid reports are not filtered out for Intuos4 WL high-speed reports.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a specific fix for a device-specific behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the provided information.

The patch is titled "staging: lustre: fix socklnd issues found by Klocwork Insight tool" and it aims to fix a null pointer dereference issue in the socklnd module of the Lustre staging driver.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. At line 804, a null pointer check is added for the variable 'best_iface' before it is used.
2. At line 838, another null pointer check is added for 'best_iface' before it is used.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference. The bug was identified using the Klocwork Insight tool, which suggests that it is a critical issue.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "gpio: tpic2810: Make tpic2810_direction_output set proper output level". This suggests that the patch aims to fix an issue related to the output level set by the tpic2810_direction_output function.

2. The patch adds a new function called "tpic2810_set" which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without the implementation of this function, it is difficult to assess the impact and correctness of the patch.

3. The tpic2810_direction_output function is modified to call the tpic2810_set function with the "chip", "offset", and "value" parameters. This change suggests that the patch intends to set the output level correctly based on the provided parameters.

Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any obvious trivial fixes.

Therefore, without further information or the complete implementation of the tpic2810_set function, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. I would recommend further analysis and testing before accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing unnecessary calls to `ipset_nest_end()` in the error paths of three different files (`ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`) within the `net/netfilter/ipset` directory.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it only removes unnecessary code, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the acpi_power_meter driver that causes the kernel to crash when it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. The current code uses the BUG() macro, which triggers a kernel panic and crashes the system. The proposed patch replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, which generates a warning message but allows the system to continue running.

The conditions that trigger the BUG() macro suggest that there is a bug in the code, but they are not fatal errors that require crashing the kernel. By replacing the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, the patch ensures that the system can handle these unexpected conditions gracefully and continue functioning.

The patch also includes additional error handling for unexpected attribute indexes in the show_str() and show_val() functions. Instead of crashing the kernel, the patch uses the WARN() macro to generate a warning message and returns an appropriate value.

Overall, the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause the kernel to crash unnecessarily and replaces it with more appropriate error handling. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue that can impact system stability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a configuration change for the target_core_device.c file in the Linux kernel. The patch sets the "buf" variable to "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1" and then passes it to the set_configfs_dev_params function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather introduces a configuration change, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant assignment for the `gpio->da9052` variable in the `da9052_gpio_probe` function. This fix does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that staticizes some symbols in the pinctrl-ab8500.c file. The symbols 'ab8500_alternate_functions' and 'ab8500_gpio_irq_cluster' are only used within this file and are not declared as static, causing warnings during compilation.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and it only addresses trivial warnings, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for setting a plane's rotation property from userspace in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for the Mali-DP driver.

   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the error code -ENOSYS with -EOPNOTSUPP for two stub operations in the audio_apbridgea driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.). 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Qualcomm's PTM v1.1 peripheral ID to the coresight-etm3x driver. This is not a critical bug fix, but rather an enhancement to support additional hardware.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: staging: lustre: llite: Invoke file_update_time in page_mkwrite
   - The patch title indicates that it is related to the staging driver for Lustre filesystem in the Linux kernel.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description states that the file times should only be updated if page_mkwrite is not set.
   - It mentions that file_update_time needs to be called manually in this case.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including James Simmons and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change adds a call to file_update_time(vma->vm_file) before the do-while loop in the ll_page_mkwrite function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a specific issue related to updating file times in the Lustre filesystem staging driver. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the bug description, severity, and impact on the system. Please provide more details about the bug being addressed by this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the Linux kernel. It updates the declaration of two arrays, `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs`, to be declared as `const struct pxa_freqs` instead of `struct pxa_freqs`. The patch also updates the `find_freq_tables()` and its callsites to use `const struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs` instead of `struct pxa_freqs **pxa_freqs`. Additionally, it updates the function `pxa_cpufreq_change_voltage()` to take a `const struct pxa_freqs *pxa_freq` parameter instead of `struct pxa_freqs *pxa_freq`. 

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and it appears to address a real issue by making the arrays and function parameters const, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros, which expand to the I2C read and write addresses, respectively. These macros are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

2. The patch replaces the usage of the `I2CR` macro with the expanded value of `devpriv->I2CAdrs | 1` and replaces the usage of the `I2CW` macro with the expanded value of `devpriv->I2CAdrs`.

3. The patch also removes the definitions of the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros from the `s626.h` header file.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is removing unnecessary macros and expanding them in place. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the changes made by the patch can be considered as trivial fixes since they involve removing macros and expanding them in place.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds the flag ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK to the enqueue_task() function calls in four different places in the code.

2. The patch includes the rationale that ENQUEUE_RESTORE should also have ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK because DEQUEUE_SAVE will have done an update_rq_clock().

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding the ENQUEUE_NOCLOCK flag to the enqueue_task() function calls in specific scenarios. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose and impact of this change.

To make an informed decision, we need more information about the bug or issue that this patch is addressing. If the bug or issue is critical and meets the criteria of causing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, if the bug or issue is not critical or does not meet the mentioned criteria, then the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please provide more information about the bug or issue that this patch is addressing, and I will be able to give a more definitive answer.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to use generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" in the phy-omap-usb2 driver, allowing the device tree node to specify the platform-specific clock name. This change is important as clocks can be named differently on multiple platforms.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Felipe Balbi and Roger Quadros. This indicates that the patch has undergone a review process and has received positive feedback.

In terms of the code changes, the patch modifies the code to use the generic clock names "wkupclk" and "refclk" instead of the specific clock names "usb_phy_cm_clk32k" and "usb_otg_ss_refclk960m". It also includes additional error handling and warning messages to handle cases where the clock names are not found or if the old clock names are used.

Overall, this patch does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a specific issue related to clock names and provides improved flexibility for different platforms. It does not introduce any spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch introduces a new callback function called `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` for the `gpio-pca953x` driver. This function is responsible for retrieving the direction of a GPIO pin. It uses the `pca953x_read_single()` function to read the register value and returns the direction based on the bit corresponding to the GPIO pin.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation and code cleanup patch rather than a fix for a real and critical bug. The patch updates the comments in init.h and adds missing initcall_sync variants. While it may improve code clarity and maintainability, it does not address any specific issue that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is adding two WARN_ON statements in the `intel_detect_pch` function in the `i915_drv.c` file of the DRM driver for Intel GPUs. These WARN_ON statements are triggered when certain conditions are not met.

The first WARN_ON statement `WARN_ON(IS_ULT(dev));` is added when the LynxPoint PCH is found but the CPU is not an ULT (Ultra Low TDP) CPU. ULT CPUs are a specific type of CPU architecture, and if the PCH is not paired with an ULT CPU, it may indicate a configuration issue or potential compatibility problem.

The second WARN_ON statement `WARN_ON(!IS_ULT(dev));` is added when the LynxPoint LP PCH is found but the CPU is not an ULT CPU. Similar to the first WARN_ON statement, this check ensures that the LP (Low Power) PCH is paired with an ULT CPU.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is addressing a potential configuration issue or compatibility problem by adding these WARN_ON statements. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it is not related to spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a potential issue related to the pairing of specific PCH types with ULT CPUs.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the conditional logic to check for an error code instead of a success code. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err` in the `cpsw_probe_dt` function in the `cpsw.c` file. This change improves consistency in error reporting by using the appropriate device-specific error function.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and alignment. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and consistency. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a function in the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset. The function `s_vGetFreeContext` is renamed to `vnt_get_free_context`. 

Since this patch only involves a function name change and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash due to a null dereference and adds error handling for a failed kzalloc allocation. This patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to a crash, making it a candidate for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a channel mismatch issue in the ASoC ak4642 codec driver. The patch updates the minimum number of channels for both playback and capture streams from 1 to 2.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a channel mismatch issue, which can lead to incorrect audio playback or capture.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes?
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the ethtool API usage in the virtio_net driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces the use of `smp_mb()` with `smp_store_mb/release()` in the `walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin()` function and `smp_store_release()` in the `walk_shadow_page_lockless_end()` function.

2. The `walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin()` function is responsible for disabling local interrupts and setting the `vcpu->mode` variable to `READING_SHADOW_PAGE_TABLES`.

3. The `smp_mb()` call in the original code ensures that the write to `vcpu->mode` is not reordered ahead of a following spte read.

4. The patch replaces `smp_mb()` with `smp_store_mb(vcpu->mode, READING_SHADOW_PAGE_TABLES)`, which provides the same memory ordering guarantees.

5. The `walk_shadow_page_lockless_end()` function is responsible for enabling local interrupts and setting the `vcpu->mode` variable to `OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE`.

6. The `smp_mb()` call in the original code ensures that the write to `vcpu->mode` is not reordered ahead of a following read.

7. The patch replaces `smp_mb()` with `smp_store_release(&vcpu->mode, OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE)`, which provides the same memory ordering guarantees.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a correct and non-trivial fix that replaces the use of `smp_mb()` with the appropriate memory barrier functions. It does not introduce any new issues and addresses potential reordering problems.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the `perf report` command in the Linux kernel. The patch adds information about an optional `print_limit` argument for the `--call-graph` command line option.

Since this patch only updates the documentation and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue related to deleting only created queues in the NVMe driver.

2. The patch uses the online queue count instead of the number of allocated queues. This change ensures that the controller returns an invalid queue identifier error to commands if a queue wasn't created.

3. The patch has been reported by Saar Gross and signed-off by Keith Busch.

4. The patch has also been reviewed by Christoph Hellwig and signed-off by Jens Axboe.

5. The code changes in the patch involve modifying the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function.

6. The `pass` variable is introduced to iterate over two passes.

7. The `queues` variable is assigned the value of `dev->online_queues - 1`.

8. The loop within the `nvme_disable_io_queues` function iterates over the queues to delete them. The `i` variable is initialized with the value of `queues`.

9. The completion is reinitialized within the loop.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug related to deleting only created queues in the NVMe driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the blackfin PTP driver. The patch converts the gettime and settime functions to use struct timespec64 instead of struct timespec, allowing the driver to handle 64-bit nanosecond values and be ready for the year 2038.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to handling time in the blackfin PTP driver and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new macro called VA_START. This macro is intended to replace the lengthy expression (UL(0xffffffffffffffff) << VA_BITS) used in multiple places within the codebase.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new API for tagging GPIO lines as in use by IRQs. This is a functional enhancement and does not fix a critical bug or address any of the mentioned issues. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. 

2. The patch includes changes to the bcm-kona GPIO driver, specifically in the functions `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_startup` and `bcm_kona_gpio_irq_shutdown`. These changes lock and unlock IRQs for the GPIO lines. While this is a functional change, it does not fix any critical bug or address any of the mentioned issues. 

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. The memset call initializes the "icount" structure to all zeros, but since the structure is allocated using kzalloc, it is already zero-initialized. Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a trivial fix (removing unnecessary code), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the soc_camera driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds support for reading from the video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix.

2. It also adds a debug line to print a message when the read function is called. This is a trivial change and does not fix any real issue.

3. The patch checks if the camera device supports the Video Buffer 2 (vb2) framework and if the IO mode is set to VB2_READ. If both conditions are met, it calls the vb2_read function to handle the read operation. This is a functional enhancement and not a bug fix.

4. If the camera device does not support reading or the conditions are not met, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating that the read operation is not implemented. This is not a critical bug or issue.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it contains trivial changes in the form of a debug line. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt disabling around one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() in the rcutorture test. The purpose of this change is to test the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled.

Since this patch is specific to the rcutorture test and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a compile issue in the obd_mount.c file of the Lustre staging driver. The issue is related to the variable "index" not being initialized before it is used in the lmd_make_exclusion function.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it can be considered a real and critical bug. Therefore, it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a check that is not doing anything useful. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the spi-armada-3700 driver. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the removal of the ".owner" field.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add a handler function for the Periodic Inquiry command complete event in the Bluetooth subsystem. However, without further details about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine its significance or criticality.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that this patch addresses. Specifically, I would need to know if the bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more details about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix, and any other relevant information, so that I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid change to make OVSP_LOCAL 32-bit in the openvswitch.h header file. This change aligns with the fact that OVS ports are now 32-bit. However, it is important to note that the kernel module still keeps port numbers as 16-bit internally.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a non-critical change related to port numbering.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless initialization of the variable 'ret'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch updates the AR9485 initvals for the ath9k driver. It mentions that the hardware peak detect calibration was failing for AR9300 chips, and the software method was implemented as an alternative.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the values in the `ar9485_1_1_baseband_postamble` array. Specifically, it changes the values at offsets `0x00009e3c` and `0x0000a2c4`.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. The patch description only mentions a failure in hardware peak detect calibration and the implementation of a software method instead. Without further details, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue being addressed.

   Additionally, the code changes in the patch seem to be modifying specific values in the `ar9485_1_1_baseband_postamble` array. These changes do not appear to fix any critical issues or address any of the mentioned criteria for acceptance in -stable releases.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the available information, it is not clear that this patch fixes a critical bug or addresses any of the mentioned criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a kmalloc() call with kzalloc(). The purpose of this change is to allocate memory that has already been zeroed, eliminating the need for the subsequent memset() calls.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: OMAPDSS: HDMI: Handle panel init error at probe
   - The patch title suggests that it addresses an issue related to handling panel initialization errors during probe.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch description mentions that the assumption of successful panel initialization should not be made blindly.
   - It also states that the mutex initialization for the hdmi.ip_data.lock should be grouped at a single place.
   - The patch is signed-off by Ricardo Neri and Tomi Valkeinen.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 60: Adds a new member "struct mutex lock" to the existing struct.
   - Line 1056: Initializes the newly added mutex "hdmi.ip_data.lock".
   - Line 1083-1085: Initializes the hdmi.ip_data.lock mutex and calls hdmi_panel_init().
   - Line 1094-1098: Handles the error case when hdmi_panel_init() fails, prints an error message, and returns the error code.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a critical issue related to handling panel initialization errors during probe. It adds proper error handling and logging when hdmi_panel_init() fails. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the plane state during initialization in the "intel_find_initial_plane_obj" function.
2. It sets the primary framebuffer (fb) to the provided fb.
3. It updates the crtc and primary plane state to point to the intel_crtc base.
4. It updates the plane mask for the intel_crtc base state.
5. It updates the frontbuffer bits for the intel_crtc pipe.
6. In the "intel_modeset_gem_init" function, it initializes the gem (Graphics Execution Manager) for the drm_device.
7. It unreferences the primary framebuffer and sets it to NULL.
8. It updates the crtc and primary plane state to NULL.
9. It updates the plane mask for the crtc state.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to be making necessary updates to the plane state during initialization and correctly handling the primary framebuffer and crtc state. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves updating critical state variables.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch moves duplicated callback functions from the codec driver to the component driver in the ASoC subsystem for the wm9713 codec. This change improves code organization and eliminates the need for duplicated functions.

Since this patch does not involve trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue in the code, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that modifies the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions in `net/mac802154/iface.c`. 

The patch changes the increment and decrement of `open_count` in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions, respectively. It replaces the `local->open_count++` increment with `!local->open_count` check and `local->open_count--` decrement with `local->open_count--` decrement.

Since this patch only involves a cleanup of the code and does not fix any real and critical bug, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the use of WARN_ON() in the srpt_abort_cmd() function in the ib_srpt.c file.

2. The current code uses WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state"), which is not the intended usage of WARN_ON(). While it will work, it is not clear what the actual state value is.

3. The patch replaces the incorrect usage with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state), which provides more useful information by showing the actual state value.

4. The change improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message, making it easier to understand and debug potential issues.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch addresses a real issue and improves the code's clarity and maintainability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the __must_check attribute to the return types of two functions in the dvb-usb driver. This attribute is used to indicate that the return value of a function must be checked by the caller.

The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a cosmetic change that improves the display of vendor information for imported USB devices.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch implements a rate_update hook in the rs (rate scaling) module of the iwlwifi driver.

2. It re-initializes rs when a rate_update hook is called, which occurs when a remote STA (station) changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

3. The patch modifies the function `iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init` to include an additional parameter `bool init`.

4. The function `rs_initialize_lq` is also modified to include the `bool init` parameter.

5. The `iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init` function is called with the `init` parameter set to `true` in the `iwl_mvm_mac_sta_state` function.

6. The `iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init` function is called again with the `init` parameter set to `false` in the new `rs_rate_update` function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is introducing a new feature related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver. It does not appear to fix a critical bug or address any real issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma". Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

Considering that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather removes a trivial check, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the `reconnect_one()` function in the `fs/exportfs/expfs.c` file. The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the handling of the case when `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` returns a different dentry (`tmp`) than the original `dentry`. In this case, the patch assumes that the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` function was called. The comment in the code suggests that if the dentry has been renamed, it must have been looked up and connected, so the function can exit.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. It is necessary to have more context about the bug being fixed and the impact it has on the system.

Without further information, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being fixed would be required to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the physical address information to the vm_struct for ioremap mappings. This change allows /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Analysis: Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it is not mentioned whether the patch contains any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.).

Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. However, if this patch addresses a real and critical bug or security issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it may be considered for inclusion.

Please provide additional context or information about the bug or issue this patch aims to fix, and whether it contains any trivial fixes, so that a more accurate assessment can be made.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command in the Linux kernel. This option allows for explicitly enabling CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. The patch also includes changes to the "perf" tool's documentation and related code files.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug or addressing a significant issue. However, based on the information provided, it seems that this patch is more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a fix for a critical bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) since it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the dm_thin_find_block() function in the dm-thin-metadata.c file. The race condition occurs when checking the fail_io flag outside the metadata device's root_lock, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue (race condition) that could potentially cause data corruption or other problems. It does not seem to be a trivial fix (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.), as it modifies the control flow of the function.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the NOHZ local_softirq_pending issue in the dp83640 driver. The patch replaces the netif_rx() function call with netif_rx_ni() to ensure it is used from process/softirq context.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses a warning related to the NOHZ local_softirq_pending issue, which can impact system stability and performance.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, but the NOHZ local_softirq_pending warning can potentially lead to system instability and performance degradation.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on replacing a function call to address the warning.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes. However, it is important to note that further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers is necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds debug error messages to report command timeout in the function `lio_process_ordered_list()` and adds host failure status in an existing error message in the function `if_cfg_callback()`.

2. In the `if_cfg_callback()` function, the patch modifies the error message to include the status value in hexadecimal format and the host failure status.

3. In the `lio_process_ordered_list()` function, the patch adds a new error message to report command failure due to a timeout. The error message includes the current time (`jiffies`) and the timeout value.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch adds important debug error messages to improve error reporting and debugging capabilities. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses critical issues related to command timeout and failure. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the redundant use of the of_match_ptr() function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming variables and converting enums into defines. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a constify patch, which means it is making the of_device_id arrays const. This change is in line with the requirement of not containing any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

The patch itself is modifying three different files: mxc_w1.c, omap_hdq.c, and w1-gpio.c. In each file, the of_device_id array is being changed from non-const to const.

Since this patch is not fixing any real and critical bugs, causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or addressing any security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

The patch modifies the `whitelist` array in the `intel_uncore.c` file of the `i915` driver. Specifically, it changes the `gen_bitmask` value for the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` entry from `GEN_RANGE(4, 8)` to `GEN_RANGE(4, 9)`.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear what the purpose of this change is and what impact it may have on the system. Without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this change addresses a real and critical bug or issue.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix and its potential impact on the system. Without that information, I cannot confidently determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch introduces a locked variant of the `nouveau_abi16_get()` function in the `drm/nouveau/abi16` module. The purpose of this patch is to provide limited interoperability by allowing USIF (User-Space Interface) to access ABI16 data.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:
1. The original `nouveau_abi16_get()` function is renamed to `nouveau_abi16()` and marked as static.
2. A new `nouveau_abi16_get()` function is introduced, which acquires the client mutex, calls `nouveau_abi16()` to check if ABI16 data is available, and returns the `cli->abi16` pointer if it exists.
3. The client mutex is unlocked before returning NULL if ABI16 data is not available.

Based on the provided information, the patch does not seem to fix any critical bugs causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. However, it does address an issue related to limited interoperability, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a non-trivial issue, it can be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the channel is set in the atusb_channel() function. The patch replaces the call to atusb_write_reg() with atusb_write_subreg() to set the channel.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing helper function `crypto_ahash_blocksize` to obtain the block size of an ahash algorithm. This function is defined as an inline function and simply returns the block size of the cipher.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use the __fls() function instead of fls() in the fib_table_lookup() function in the net/ipv4/fib_trie.c file.

2. The comment in the patch mentions that __fls(x) is faster than fls(x) when we know that x is non-null.

3. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from Eric Dumazet and a Cc line to Ben Hutchings.

4. The code change itself replaces the line `int mp = KEYLENGTH - fls(pref_mismatch);` with `int mp = KEYLENGTH - __fls(pref_mismatch) - 1;`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a performance optimization that replaces the fls() function with __fls() in the fib_table_lookup() function. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the change seems to be a trivial fix rather than a significant improvement.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

5. Code changes:
   - The patch adds a mutex_destroy() call in the emmaprp_probe() function when the driver is removed.
   - It also adds a mutex_destroy() call in the emmaprp_remove() function when the driver is removed.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is a trivial fix that adds missing mutex_destroy() calls when the driver is removed. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the qlcnic driver. The patch clears the link status when the interface is down, preventing the driver from issuing a get statistics command when the interface is not operational.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a specific behavior related to the qlcnic driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the Bluetooth subsystem in the Linux kernel. It involves moving the check for backlog size from l2cap_core.c to l2cap_sock.c and removing socket-specific code from l2cap_core.c. The patch also includes changes to the l2cap_le_conn_ready() and l2cap_connect_req() functions in l2cap_core.c and the l2cap_sock_new_connection_cb() function in l2cap_sock.c.

Based on the provided patch, it seems that the changes are aimed at improving the handling of backlog size in the Bluetooth subsystem. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if the changes fix a real and critical bug or address a security issue.

To make an informed decision, we would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed and its impact on the system. Without this information, it is not possible to definitively say whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

Therefore, based solely on the provided patch, I would lean towards not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further information is available.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary memset call. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes a trivial operation, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adjusts the function signature of `regulator_get_error_flags()`. This change is made to prevent compiler errors when `CONFIG_REGULATOR` is not defined.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (changing function signature), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve deferring the building of the OSD request until just before submitting it in various callers.

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake platform by including it in the list of supported CPU families in the `intel_pstate_cpu_ids` array.

2. The patch does not seem to fix any specific bug or address any critical issue. It is simply adding support for a new platform.

3. The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. It is primarily adding support for a new platform. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new advertising setting in the Bluetooth subsystem. This patch introduces a new flag, `HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE`, which allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, this patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch extends the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Olli Salonen and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code changes: The patch modifies the `frequency_min` value in the `si2157_ops` structure from 110000000 to 55000000.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is extending the minimum frequency range for the Si2157 tuner to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. This change does not seem to fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only modifies a numerical value without addressing any critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the '0x' notation when using the %pad format. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes forward declarations of the `struct super_block` in multiple files. Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes trivial forward declarations, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the arm64 architecture and specifically addresses the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) for Cortex A53 processors. It adds missing L2 cache events (read/write accesses and misses) and DTLB (Data Translation Lookaside Buffer) refills.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to fix a specific issue related to monitoring and measuring cache and TLB behavior on Cortex A53 processors. This does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it adds missing functionality that could be critical for performance analysis and debugging.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address a specific issue related to performance monitoring, which could be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on this analysis, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a NAK, as it does not seem to meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the final decision may depend on the specific policies and guidelines of the Linux kernel maintainers.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to ext4 encryption policies. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check to ensure that encryption policies can only be set on directories. This check is performed by verifying if the inode's mode is a directory (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode)). If it is not a directory, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid argument.

2. The check is necessary because encryption policies should only be applicable to directories, not regular files or other types of inodes. This ensures that encryption is only applied where it is intended to be used.

3. The patch also includes a "Signed-off-by" line, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the author.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue and introduces a necessary check to prevent incorrect usage of encryption policies. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it adds a significant functionality improvement. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo in the code. The patch does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

   The patch is signed-off by Richard Zhao <richard.zhao@linaro.org> and Sascha Hauer <s.hauer@pengutronix.de>.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the audmux_read_file() and mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port() functions in the arch/arm/plat-mxc/audmux-v2.c file.

   - In audmux_read_file():
     - The patch replaces the call to clk_enable(audmux_clk) with clk_prepare_enable(audmux_clk).
     - The patch replaces the call to clk_disable(audmux_clk) with clk_disable_unprepare(audmux_clk).

   - In mxc_audmux_v2_configure_port():
     - The patch replaces the call to clk_enable(audmux_clk) with clk_prepare_enable(audmux_clk).
     - The patch replaces the call to clk_disable(audmux_clk) with clk_disable_unprepare(audmux_clk).

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a migration to the generic clk framework API. It replaces the usage of clk_enable() and clk_disable() with clk_prepare_enable() and clk_disable_unprepare() respectively.

   This change seems to be a non-trivial fix as it involves modifying the clock handling code. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if this change addresses a real and critical bug or if it introduces any new issues.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the available information, it is not clear whether this patch fixes a critical bug or addresses a significant issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further information or justification is provided.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and may not consider the broader context or dependencies within the Linux kernel codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a local variable and using a helper function to validate trigger arguments. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for a special WHEA _OSC call to turn on APEI firmware first mode explicitly on some machines.
2. It includes a new function called "apei_osc_setup" in the file "drivers/acpi/apei/apei-base.c" that handles the setup.
3. The function "apei_osc_setup" initializes a context structure and sets the necessary parameters for the WHEA _OSC call.
4. It calls the ACPI function "acpi_run_osc" to execute the WHEA _OSC call and enable APEI firmware first mode.
5. If the call is successful, it frees the memory allocated for the context structure and returns 0.
6. The function is exported as a symbol using "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL" in order to be used by other modules.
7. In the file "drivers/acpi/apei/ghes.c", the function "apei_osc_setup" is called during the initialization of the GHES driver.
8. Depending on the return value of "apei_osc_setup", different informational messages are printed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds necessary functionality to enable APEI firmware first mode on certain machines. This is not a trivial fix and addresses a potential issue related to hardware error notification. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for increasing the scan timeout in the iwlwifi driver. The patch increases the timeout from 7 seconds to 15 seconds to avoid aborting a scan that may take longer than expected.

Since this patch addresses a real issue related to scan timeouts, it can be considered a critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK hack in the Linux kernel's scheduler. The patch introduces a new attribute, attr::sched_flags, to properly handle the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.

The patch modifies the sched_setscheduler() and sched_setscheduler_nocheck() functions to use the new attribute and handle the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag correctly. It also introduces a new helper function, _sched_setscheduler(), to handle the fixup of the legacy hack.

Overall, this patch seems to address a real issue related to the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag and improves the handling of the scheduler attributes. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch itself does not include any specific changes or fixes, but rather adds a new variable "neg_one" with a value of -1 to the sysctl.c file.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted, we need more context and information about the purpose and impact of the next patch that will use the "neg_one" variable. Without that information, it is difficult to assess whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or issue.

Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for why the "neg_one" variable is being added. It is important to have a clear understanding of the purpose and necessity of any changes being made to the Linux kernel.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further context and justification are provided.

2. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the atl1_tx_map function in the atl1.c file. Specifically, it replaces the existing code for mapping DMA buffers with a new implementation using the SKB paged frag API.

3. Analysis: Based on the provided patch, it seems to be a code improvement rather than a fix for a critical bug. The patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a "trivial" fix related to code optimization rather than addressing a critical issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if you have any other patches to analyze.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the shmobile_init_delay() function in the ARM shmobile platform. The bug is related to device node reference leakage caused by the use of of_find_compatible_node() function, which returns a new reference to the found node without releasing the previous reference.

The patch proposes a solution by simplifying the code and replacing the of_find_compatible_node() calls with of_device_is_compatible() function. This change reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(1) and ensures that the device node references are properly released using of_node_put().

The patch also introduces additional improvements by moving the CPU identification logic inside the loop over cpu nodes, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

Overall, the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially lead to resource leaks and improves the code structure. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a critical issue, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to modify the cache push and clear code for the ColdFire architecture with MMU enabled. The patch includes changes to flush the branch cache on the write-through cache setup of the ColdFire V4e with MMU enabled.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue. The patch only migrates the jazz driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by the clockevents core, without providing any set-state callbacks or addressing any specific problem.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a code cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix the AUX_CTRL register setup for RT3090, RT3390, RT3593, and RT5592 chips in the rt2800pci driver. It enables PCIe wakeup for these chips, similar to what is done in the 2011_1007_RT5390_RT5392_Linux_STA_V2.5.0.3_DPO driver.

2. References:
   The patch references the rt28xx_init function in common/rtmp_init_intf.c and the RTMPInitPCIeLinkCtrlValue function in os/linux/rt_rbus_pci_drv.c.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch modify the rt2800pci_init_registers function in rt2800pci.c.

   - Line 507: The patch adds additional conditions to enable PCIe wakeup for the specified chips (RT3090, RT3390, RT3593, RT5390, RT5392, and RT5592). Previously, only RT3572 was considered.
   - Line 510-511: The patch reads the current value of the AUX_CTRL register and sets the AUX_CTRL_FORCE_PCIE_CLK and AUX_CTRL_WAKE_PCIE_EN fields to 1.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to the AUX_CTRL register setup for certain chips in the rt2800pci driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and addresses a potential issue with PCIe wakeup. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that avoids a pointless delay in the `o2cb_cluster_check()` function in the ocfs2 file system. The patch fixes an off-by-one error in the loop condition, which prevents an unnecessary delay on the final iteration.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by replacing "if (foo == false)" with "if (!foo)". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change and whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `freezable_schedule_timeout_killable()` function in the PM/Freezer subsystem. The patch correctly modifies the code to return the value from `schedule_timeout_killable()` instead of `freezer_count()`. The patch also includes a comment explaining the purpose of the change.

Since the bug is harmless and all current callers ignore the return code, the patch is not critical and does not fix a real issue that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content and purpose.

The patch appears to be related to the ACPICA (ACPI Component Architecture) disassembler. It adds warnings for unresolved control methods, which means that the disassembler was unable to determine the number of arguments to parse for the method invocation.

The changes made in the patch include adding two new global variables, "acpi_gbl_num_external_methods" and "acpi_gbl_resolved_external_methods," and modifying the "struct acpi_external_list" in "aclocal.h" to include a new field called "resolved."

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a potential issue in the ACPICA disassembler by adding warnings for unresolved control methods. Unresolved control methods can lead to incorrect parsing of arguments, which can cause various issues such as build errors, oops, or data corruption.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for 1080p capture at 2 fps and 5 fps to webcam emulation in the vivid driver. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the driver.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch is modifying the return parameters of the Start Discovery command in the Bluetooth management code. It ensures that the same address type passed to the command is also returned in the response message.

While this patch improves consistency, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch are relatively minor and do not seem to have a significant impact on the overall functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unreachable code block. The only change made is the removal of the pr_debug() statement, which is stated to never be executed.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the "byPacketType" variable is not set at all in the vt6655 driver.

2. Changes Made: The patch adds a line of code to set the "byPacketType" variable by calling the "CARDbyGetPktType" function. Additionally, it changes the condition in the "CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate" function to check the "basic_rates" variable instead of the "wBasicRate" variable.

3. Impact Analysis:
   a. The issue being fixed: The patch addresses a bug where the "byPacketType" variable is not set, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.
   b. Criticality: The impact of this bug is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the criticality of the bug.
   c. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether the bug being fixed is critical or if it causes any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Given the lack of criticality information and the absence of trivial fixes, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further information about the bug's impact and criticality would be necessary to make a more definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch introduces a new helper function called `sk_stream_is_writeable()` which is used to replace a hardcoded condition in several call sites. The purpose of this change is to accommodate the upcoming support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will modify the condition for TCP sockets.

The patch itself does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a potential issue related to socket writeability and ensures that the correct condition is used consistently across different parts of the codebase.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch modifies the file `fs/aio.c` and is signed-off by Al Viro, a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

2. The change is made in the function `__put_ioctx`, which is responsible for releasing resources associated with an I/O context.

3. The patch replaces the previous method of canceling the delayed work and synchronously canceling the work with a single call to `cancel_delayed_work_sync(&ctx->wq)`.

4. The `cancel_delayed_work_sync` function cancels a delayed work item and waits for it to complete before returning. This ensures that any pending work is canceled and completed before freeing resources.

5. The patch also frees the AIO ring associated with the context and drops the reference to the memory management structure.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch fixes a potential issue with canceling delayed work in the `__put_ioctx` function. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a potential bug that could lead to resource leaks or other issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the DRM driver for Intel GPUs. Additionally, there is a small refactoring for the gen2 code.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv in the `valleyview_irq_handler` function. This seems to address a real issue related to CRC calculations and could potentially help in identifying display-related problems. Therefore, this part of the patch seems to fix a real and critical bug, making it a candidate for inclusion in a stable release.

2. The patch also adds support for CRC interrupts in the `i8xx_irq_handler` function for gen2. This is a small refactoring that aligns with the changes made in the previous step. Although it is not explicitly mentioned whether this refactoring addresses a specific bug or issue, it seems to be a necessary change to ensure consistency across different generations of Intel GPUs. Therefore, this part of the patch can be considered non-trivial and could be included in a stable release.

3. The patch adds support for CRC interrupts in the `i915_irq_handler` function for gen3. Similar to the previous step, this change aligns with the changes made earlier and ensures consistency across different generations. Therefore, this part of the patch can also be considered non-trivial and could be included in a stable release.

4. The patch adds support for CRC interrupts in the `i965_irq_handler` function for gen4. Again, this aligns with the changes made earlier and ensures consistency across different generations. Therefore, this part of the patch can be considered non-trivial and could be included in a stable release.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses real and critical bugs related to CRC interrupts and ensures consistency across different generations of Intel GPUs.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that filters out no-op frontbuffer tracking flushes. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or address any known issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: drm/amdgpu: prevent get_user_pages recursion
   - The patch title suggests that the patch aims to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages function in the amdgpu driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the amdgpu_ttm_tt structure to include a spinlock and a list to track tasks that are inside the get_user_pages function.
   - The patch adds code to add the current task to the list before calling get_user_pages and removes it from the list afterward.
   - The patch also adds code to check if the current task is already in the list before allowing access to user pages.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a potential issue of recursion in the get_user_pages function in the amdgpu driver.
   - It introduces a spinlock and a list to track tasks inside the get_user_pages function, ensuring that recursion is prevented.
   - The patch adds code to check if the current task is already in the list before accessing user pages, preventing potential issues.
   - The changes made by the patch seem to be focused on preventing a specific issue and do not appear to be trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a potential recursion issue in the get_user_pages function in the amdgpu driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicated "const" keyword. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only makes the functions __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() and __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_add() symmetric, which is not a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf in the dw-mipi-dsi driver.

2. The patch changes the type of tx_buf from u16 to u8, which avoids the out-of-bounds read issue.

3. The patch also introduces a new variable "data" of type u16 and initializes it to 0.

4. The patch then checks the length of the tx_buf and sets the appropriate bits in the "data" variable based on the contents of tx_buf.

5. If the tx_buf length is greater than 2, an error message is printed, and the function returns -EINVAL.

6. Finally, the patch constructs the value "val" by encoding the "data" and the message type, and passes it to the dw_mipi_dsi_gen_pkt_hdr_write() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug by avoiding an out-of-bounds read on tx_buf. It also introduces a more explicit encoding of endianness. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "tcp: Validate route interface in early demux" and is signed-off by David S. Miller. It modifies the tcp_v4_early_demux function in the net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c file.

The patch introduces a new variable "dev" of type struct net_device and assigns it the value of skb->dev. It then replaces the reference to skb->dev->ifindex with dev->ifindex in the call to __inet_lookup_established function.

The purpose of this patch is to validate the route interface in the early demux process to avoid violating reverse path filtering. It ensures that the route interface matches the interface index of the incoming packet.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to reverse path filtering. It validates the route interface before performing further processing, which helps prevent potential issues such as data corruption or security vulnerabilities.

Considering the significance of the issue being addressed and the nature of the patch, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis, including testing and review by kernel maintainers, is necessary to make a final determination.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that initializes a static variable to 0. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (initializing a variable to 0), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch fixes the port offset for DMEM registers in the drm/nouveau/falcon driver.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the nvkm_falcon_v1_load_dmem and nvkm_falcon_v1_read_dmem functions in the v1.c file. It updates the register offsets used to write and read data to/from DMEM registers.

3. Impact Analysis: The patch addresses a specific issue related to the port offset for DMEM registers. It ensures that the correct offset is used when writing and reading data, preventing potential data corruption or incorrect behavior.

4. Bug Severity: The patch does not explicitly mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. However, it addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect data handling, which can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

5. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although it does not fix a critical bug or a security issue, it addresses a potential issue that can cause incorrect data handling.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the value of GEN6_RP_DOWN_TIMEOUT from hexadecimal to decimal and reorders the register writes. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is related to the Intel i915 graphics driver.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue. The patch adds a check for a NULL platform data pointer, which could indicate incorrect setup by a driver. This check ensures that the platform data is properly defined before proceeding with the initialization.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid CamelCase naming convention.

2. The patch is signed-off by Leo Kim, Tony Cho, and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. In the `struct scan_attr`, the `pfScanResult` member is renamed to `result`.

4. In the `Handle_Scan` function, the `pfUserScanResult` member of `strWILC_UsrScanReq` is assigned the value of `result` from `pstrHostIFscanAttr`.

5. In the `host_int_scan` function, the `pfScanResult` member of `body.scan_info` is assigned the value of `ScanResult`, which is not defined in the provided patch.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is a trivial fix that only renames a variable to follow naming conventions. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch is titled "xprtrdma: Rename rpcrdma_receive_wc()".
   - It mentions that there was a missed spot when converting xprtrdma to use the new CQ API.

   - It appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function and updating the assignment.
   - The patch does not introduce any new functionality or address any critical bug.

Based on the analysis, this patch seems to be a trivial fix that does not address any critical issue. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code cleanup and optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve switching from using the "iterate" field to the "iterate_shared" field in the file_operations structure for various file systems.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect error message in the ext4_ext_insert_index function.
2. The error message currently refers to "logical" and "ei_block," which is incorrect.
3. The patch updates the error message to correctly refer to "eh_entries" and "eh_max."
4. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering these points, the patch addresses a real issue in the code and improves the accuracy of error messages. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves some deallocations to the `dev_release()` function, which is part of the class device lifetime management features. This is a good practice as it promotes code reuse and simplifies the codebase.

2. The `regulator_dev_release()` function is modified to deallocate the `rdev->constraints` and release the reference to `rdev->dev.of_node` using `of_node_put()`. These deallocations are moved from `regulator_unregister()` to `regulator_dev_release()`. This change ensures that the deallocations are consistently performed when the device is released.

3. In `regulator_unregister()`, the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and the release of `rdev->dev.of_node` are removed. These deallocations are now handled in `regulator_dev_release()`. This change simplifies the `regulator_unregister()` function.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a code improvement that promotes better code organization and reuse.

1. The patch is titled "NFS: fix pnfs regression with directio writes". This suggests that it addresses a regression issue related to parallel NFS (pnfs) and direct I/O writes.

2. The commit message explains that a previous commit (57208fa7e51) did not modify the calls in direct.c, which prevented direct I/O from using pnfs. This patch reintroduces the capability.

3. The patch modifies two lines of code in the direct.c file. In both cases, it replaces the call to "nfs_pageio_init_write" with "NFS_PROTO(dreq->inode)->write_pageio_init".

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a regression issue related to pnfs and direct I/O writes. It modifies the code to correctly enable pnfs for direct I/O. Since this is a real and critical bug fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros. These macros are described as "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscate the code." The patch also replaces the usage of these macros with direct code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section conflict in the mm/percpu.c file. The changes involve modifying the declaration of the `pcpu_fc_names` array in the `include/linux/percpu.h` header file and the definition of the same array in the `mm/percpu.c` file.

The patch changes the declaration of `pcpu_fc_names` from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` in the `include/linux/percpu.h` header file. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, indicating that the array elements are constant pointers.

In the `mm/percpu.c` file, the patch modifies the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array and also changes the attribute from `__initdata` to `__initconst`, indicating that the array is initialized with constant data during the initialization phase.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a section conflict and making the `pcpu_fc_names` array constant. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it falls under the categories of critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the issue described. The patch removes the reliance on the 'driver' argument in the pxa27x_udc_stop() function by passing NULL instead. This change ensures that future patches can safely remove the 'driver' argument without causing any issues.

Since this patch addresses a potential problem and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the b43 N-PHY driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements reading support for radio 0x2057 and handles the different register values based on the device's PHY revision.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to the format specifier used for printing a DMA address in the `dump_dtd` function of the `ti-vpe` driver. The warning suggests that the `%x` format specifier is used for an argument of type `dma_addr_t`, which is incorrect.

The patch replaces the `%x` format specifier with `%pad`, which is the correct format specifier for printing a `dma_addr_t` value. This change ensures that the correct type is used for printing the DMA address.

Considering the patch addresses a warning related to incorrect format specifier usage, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a whitespace cleanup patch. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

It falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, as it only involves a minor formatting change.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific hardware issue related to the RTC alarm interrupt numbers on the S2MPS11 and S2MPS14 devices. The patch ensures consistent interrupt numbers and adds a build bug check for future generations.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a specific hardware compatibility issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "NFC: Unlink LLCP child sockets from llcp_sock_release". From the title, it seems like the patch is addressing an issue related to NFC (Near Field Communication) and unlinking child sockets.

2. The patch author is Samuel Ortiz, and there is an additional sign-off from John W. Linville.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the `llcp_sock_release` function in the `net/nfc/llcp/sock.c` file.

4. In the modified code, there is a check to see if `llcp_sock` is equal to `local->sockets[llcp_sock->ssap]`. If it is, the corresponding entry in `local->sockets` is set to NULL.

5. If the check fails, the patch uses a list traversal to find the `llcp_sock` entry in the list of child sockets under the parent socket. Once found, it unlinks the `llcp_sock` entry from the list.

6. Finally, the patch releases the lock and completes the function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to unlinking child sockets in the NFC LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol) implementation. While the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs or issues, it seems to be a targeted fix for a potential problem.

Considering the nature of the patch and the absence of any trivial changes, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further review and testing by the appropriate maintainers and experts in the NFC subsystem would be necessary to make a final decision.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review by the Linux kernel maintainers is recommended before making a final determination.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only changes the argument name of the `host_int_add_ptk` function declaration. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the deprecated create_singlethread_workqueue() function in the drivers/infiniband/core/iwcm.c file. The patch replaces it with alloc_ordered_workqueue() with the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set.

Since this patch addresses a deprecated function and ensures forward progress under memory pressure, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds a check to validate the number of reserved QPs (Queue Pairs) in the mlx4 driver.

2. Code Changes: The patch introduces the following changes:
   - Adds a new variable `reserved_from_bot` to store the number of reserved QPs from the bottom.
   - Checks if the sum of `reserved_from_bot` and `reserved_from_top` (number of reserved QPs from the top) exceeds the total number of QPs (`dev->caps.num_qps`).
   - If the number of reserved QPs is higher than the total number of QPs, it prints an error message and returns `-EINVAL`.
   - Initializes the bitmap for the QP table with the correct number of reserved QPs.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a potential issue where the number of reserved QPs could exceed the total number of QPs.
   - If this were to happen, it could lead to various problems, such as resource exhaustion or incorrect behavior.
   - The patch adds a check to ensure that the number of reserved QPs is within the feasible range.
   - If the check fails, it returns an error, preventing the system from proceeding with an invalid configuration.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or resource exhaustion. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing check for the return value of `sme_wait_for_reply` function in the `sme_ap_config` function of the `sme_blocking.c` file in the staging directory.

This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to be a "trivial" fix as it involves replacing function calls without any significant impact on the code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `uart_usp_ff_empty_mask` function in the `sirfsoc_uart.h` file.

2. The change is a correction to the calculation of the `empty_bit` variable.

3. Previously, the `empty_bit` was calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the `fifosize` variable.

4. The patch modifies the calculation by adding 1 to the result of the logarithm calculation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that corrects a calculation in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to mark the actual interrupt source for some interrupts currently marked as reserved in the ARM mx53 platform.

2. Impact: This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a functional change rather than a critical bug fix.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the interrupt definitions in the mx53.h header file. It replaces the reserved interrupt numbers with new interrupt numbers that correspond to specific interrupt sources.

4. Analysis: The changes made in this patch do not address any critical issues or fix any bugs. It seems to be a non-critical functional change to update the interrupt definitions.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-critical functional change rather than a bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only updates the version number in the dm-ioctl.h header file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug reported by Smatch, which complains about the cast to "int" in min_t() changing very large values of current_read_size into negative values. This indicates a potential issue that could lead to incorrect values being returned by min_t().

2. The patch removes the "const" qualifier, which is unnecessary in this context. This change does not affect the functionality of the code but improves code readability.

3. The patch modifies the current_read_size assignment by changing the type from "const int" to "uint" (unsigned int). This change ensures that the current_read_size variable is always positive and avoids the potential issue of negative values.

4. The patch also includes a conditional check to limit the current_read_size value based on the capabilities of the SMB server. This ensures that the read request does not exceed the negotiated limit for certain Windows versions.

Based on the analysis, the patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect values and improves the code's correctness and readability. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds loopback mode support to the spi-imx driver. Loopback mode can be activated by setting the LBC (LoopBack Control) bit of the ECSPI_TESTREG register.

2. The patch defines the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG and MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC constants to represent the register address and the bit for loopback control, respectively.

3. In the mx51_ecspi_config function, the patch reads the current value of the ECSPI_TESTREG register using the readl function.

4. If the SPI_LOOP flag is set in the config->mode field, the patch sets the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC bit in the register value. Otherwise, it clears the MX51_ECSPI_TESTREG_LBC bit.

5. The modified register value is then written back to the ECSPI_TESTREG register using the writel function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary feature to the spi-imx driver by enabling loopback mode support. Loopback mode can be useful for testing and debugging purposes. Since it does not fix a critical bug or address a security issue, it can be considered a non-trivial enhancement.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a security issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds the capability for a device tree source (DTS) author to flag a particular timer in the system as the system timer. If the chosen node in the DTS contains a "system-timer=<&foo>" entry, that handle will be used to determine the system timer. If no such entry exists, the first found timer will be used (current behavior).

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by Peter A. G. Crosthwaite <peter.crosthwaite@petalogix.com> and Michal Simek <monstr@monstr.eu>.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch are as follows:

   - Line 257: The existing code `timer = of_find_compatible_node(NULL, NULL, "xlnx,xps-timer-1.00.a");` is modified.
   - Lines 258-265: The new code is added to check for the "system-timer" property in the chosen node and set the timer accordingly.
   - Line 266: If no timer is found, a message is printed.
   - Line 268: If no timer is found, the default timer is used.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a functional enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. It does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve the clarity of the interrupt handling code in the iwlwifi PCIe driver.

2. The patch replaces the existing interrupt handling functions `iwl_pcie_isr_non_ict` and `iwl_pcie_isr_ict` with `iwl_pcie_int_cause_non_ict` and `iwl_pcie_int_cause_ict`, respectively.

3. The `iwl_pcie_irq_handler` function is modified to determine the interrupt type (`use_ict`) and call the appropriate interrupt handling function accordingly.

4. The patch does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be a code refactoring for clarity purposes.

Based on the provided information, this patch seems to be a "trivial" fix that improves code readability without addressing any critical bugs or issues. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to Bluetooth and aims to fix the negotiation of pairing parameters during the implementation of SM key distribution. It introduces changes to the `build_pairing_cmd` function and its usage in various places.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a real and critical bug or if it fixes any issues that could cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other critical problems. The patch seems to be more focused on improving the negotiation process and simplifying the key negotiation method.

Without further context or information about the specific bug or issue this patch addresses, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, based on the given information, it seems that this patch may not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a printk statement with pr_err. The change is aimed at addressing a checkpatch.pl warning related to the preferred usage of logging functions.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (spelling change, whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reduce contention on the gfs2_log_lock.

2. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_data`, the patch adds a check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the patch sets the `TR_TOUCHED` flag and skips taking the `gfs2_log_lock`. This change helps avoid unnecessary contention on the `gfs2_log_lock`.

3. In the function `gfs2_trans_add_meta`, the patch adds a similar check to see if the `buffer_head` is already in a transaction. If it is, the patch sets the `TR_TOUCHED` flag and skips taking the `gfs2_log_lock`. Again, this change reduces contention on the `gfs2_log_lock`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue of contention on the `gfs2_log_lock` and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the ipr driver in the Linux kernel. The patch increases the dump size in the ipr driver to 80MB to aid in debugging new SAS controllers. This change does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a specific issue related to debugging and potentially improves the driver's functionality.

Considering that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds DMA resume capability to resume the DMA position when a stream is suspended/resumed.

2. It saves the position in suspend and starts the stream from that position when resumed using the new DMA resume capabilities.

3. It enables the DMA Resume enable bit for the stream and sets the dpib and lpib positions to resume before starting the DMA.

4. It saves the dpib and lpib positions when the stream is suspended.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to DMA resume and stream suspension/resumption. It introduces new capabilities and ensures that the stream starts from the correct position when resumed. This can potentially prevent issues such as data corruption or hangs.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix the default value for available voltages in the mxcmci_probe function of the mxcmmc driver.

2. The issue being addressed is that if available voltages are not given, the mmc_regulator_get_supply() function returns 0, and the mxcmmc driver does not set a value for the ocr_avail mask.

3. The patch proposes to fix this by assuming MMC_VDD_32_33 | MMC_VDD_33_34 as the default value, as stated in the comment in platform_data/mmc-mxcmmc.h.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Matteo Facchinetti and Sascha Hauer.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to the default value for available voltages in the mxcmmc driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves setting a default value based on specific conditions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies a NULL comparison. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ath9k wireless driver and specifically adds SERDES initialization values for the AR9462 2.1 chip. It includes changes to the ar9003_hw_init_mode_regs function in the ar9003_hw.c file and adds a new initialization array in the ar9462_2p1_initvals.h file.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any of the mentioned issues. We would need more context or information about the bug or issue it aims to solve.

Without further information, it is not possible to make a definitive decision. However, if this patch addresses a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if it is a trivial fix or does not address any critical issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the i40e_nvm.c file in the i40e driver for Intel Ethernet devices.

2. The patch adds additional debug information to the i40e_acquire_nvm function.

3. The patch changes the behavior of polling on the NVM semaphore. Previously, it would always poll, but now it will only poll if there is time left on a previous reservation.

4. The patch also adds debug messages to provide more information when the NVM acquire fails or times out.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the behavior of the i40e driver by optimizing the polling on the NVM semaphore and providing more detailed debug information. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix that does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds comments to the code and exports some clock IDs for PWM related clocks.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to the "fw_func_mode" field, which was defined too small to recognize dual-chute mode. This bug could potentially cause functional issues or incorrect behavior.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly mention any of these issues. However, if the bug it fixes is left unaddressed, it could potentially lead to functional issues or incorrect behavior, which can be considered as "oh, that's not good" issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It focuses on changing the data type of the "fw_func_mode" field to address the bug.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to functional issues or incorrect behavior.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to watchdog ping return errors being ignored by the watchdog core. The patch propagates the ping error code to the user space, ensuring that the watchdog daemon is informed about possible hardware errors or unregistered device drivers.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real issue that could potentially lead to hardware errors or instability. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch modifies the `nvme_get_features` function by removing the `result` parameter and changing the return type to `void`. It also adds a new function `nvme_set_features` that takes the `result` parameter and performs the necessary operations.

The patch then updates the `set_queue_count` function to use `nvme_set_features` instead of `nvme_get_features` to set the number of queues.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a bug related to setting the number of queues correctly in the NVMe driver. It is not a trivial fix as it involves changing the function signature and introducing a new function. However, without further context or information about the bug itself, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases until more information is available about the bug it fixes and its impact on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks certain functions as static in the `tfc_conf.c` file.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the mv88e6xxx_set_port_state function in the dsa/mv88e6xxx.c file. The patch ensures that the correct error code is returned if the _mv88e6xxx_reg_read function returns an error.

Since this patch addresses an error handling issue, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves cleaning up the usage of the `hcpriv` field in the `octeon-usb` staging driver. The changes involve using `ep->hcpriv` for the pipe handle and `urb->hcpriv` for the submit handle, instead of packing both into the same field.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to flushing the IOMMU TLB in the AMD IOMMU driver. The patch directly performs the flush in the `dma_ops_free_addresses` function instead of setting a flag and performing the flush later.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to TLB flushing in the AMD IOMMU driver. If this issue causes a hang, data corruption, or any other critical problem, it can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption?
   - The patch itself does not introduce any build errors, oopses, hangs, or data corruption.

3. Does it fix a real security issue?
   - The patch does not mention any security-related fixes.

4. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker support for Asus AiO ZN270IE" and is aimed at resolving the issue of no audio output for the internal speaker and headphone on the Asus AiO ZN270IE with ALC256. The patch enables GPIO 2 as an amp and pulls it high.

Looking at the code changes, the patch adds a new fixup entry, `ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_AIO_GPIO2`, to the `alc269_fixups` array in `patch_realtek.c`. This fixup entry sets up GPIO2 for the speaker amp by sending specific AC_VERB commands.

Additionally, the patch adds a new entry to the `alc269_fixup_tbl` array in `patch_realtek.c` to associate the fixup with the specific PCI device ID of the Asus ZN270IE.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific hardware issue on the Asus AiO ZN270IE by enabling and configuring GPIO2 as an amp for the speaker. This fix is not a trivial change and is necessary to enable audio output on the affected device.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a lack of audio output, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves code refactoring and consolidation. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of sscanf with kstrtoint. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any significant improvements or optimizations.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing call to `platform_set_drvdata` in the `da9052_bat_probe` function. This fix ensures that the driver data is properly set for the platform device, preventing a potential issue where `platform_get_drvdata` would return NULL in `da9052_bat_remove`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a log message if DP link training fails in the Nouveau display driver.

2. The change is made in the `nouveau_dp_train` function in the `dport.c` file.

3. The patch modifies the while loop condition from `while (link_bw[0])` to `while ((ret = -EIO) && link_bw[0])`. This change introduces a new variable `ret` and assigns the value `-EIO` to it. The loop will continue as long as `link_bw[0]` is not zero and `ret` is equal to `-EIO`.

4. After the loop, if `ret` is less than zero, it logs an error message stating that link training failed.

5. The patch then executes the post-train script from the vbios.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real issue related to DP link training failure in the Nouveau display driver. It adds a log message to indicate when the link training fails, which can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that checks the return value of the `nla_put_be32` function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.), it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MC13783 RTC functionality on the MX31PDK board. This can be considered a real and critical bug fix as it enables the proper functioning of the RTC feature on the board.

Since the patch addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) topology support in the Linux kernel. The patch adds support for ABI (Application Binary Interface) version 4 and ensures backward compatibility.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an enhancement or compatibility improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a request for P2P (Peer-to-Peer) capabilities during target initialization in the ath6kl driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a new variable "ret" of type int.
   - This is a trivial change and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch calls the function "ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd" with specific flags to request P2P capabilities.
   - This change is related to P2P functionality and does not fix any real or critical bug.

3. The patch includes error handling for the return value of "ath6kl_wmi_info_req_cmd".
   - This is a good practice, but it does not fix any real or critical bug.

Based on the analysis, the patch does not fix any real or critical bug. It adds P2P capability request functionality, which is not considered a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is intended to mark `i915.enable_gvt` as false if loading the GVT (Graphics Virtualization Technology) fails. This change allows userspace to easily detect when the GVT fails to load as requested.

Analyzing the patch, it seems to address a potential issue where the GVT initialization fails at different stages. Instead of returning 0 (success) directly, the patch introduces a `bail` label and sets `i915.enable_gvt` to 0 before returning 0. This ensures that `i915.enable_gvt` is marked as false if the GVT fails to load.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or a non-critical fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue where regulatory events are processed before the wiphy is registered, leading to a potential problem when calling regulatory_hint() at an early stage.

2. The patch adds a new boolean variable "wiphy_registered" to the "struct ath6kl" in the core.h file. This variable will track the registration status of the wiphy.

3. In the ath6kl_cfg80211_init() function in cfg80211.c, the patch sets "ar->wiphy_registered" to true after the wiphy is registered.

4. In the ath6kl_cfg80211_cleanup() function in cfg80211.c, the patch sets "ar->wiphy_registered" to false before unregistering the wiphy.

5. In the ath6kl_wmi_regdomain_event() function in wmi.c, the patch adds a check for "wmi->parent_dev->wiphy_registered" before processing the regulatory event.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue related to regulatory events being processed before the wiphy is registered. It introduces a new variable to track the registration status and adds a check to ensure that the regulatory event is only processed if the wiphy is registered.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to incorrect regulatory processing, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch adds support for the `vidioc_create_bufs` operation in the `bfin_capture` driver in the `media` subsystem. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch does not mention any bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding a new feature or functionality rather than fixing a bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - There is no indication that this patch addresses any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to make the saa7134 driver more V4L2 compliant by filtering audio modes that came from the tuner. It keeps only MONO/STEREO audio modes in radio mode.

2. Code Changes:
   The code change is made in the `radio_g_tuner` function in the `saa7134-video.c` file. The line `t->audmode &= V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO | V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO;` filters the audio modes by performing a bitwise AND operation with `V4L2_TUNER_MODE_MONO` and `V4L2_TUNER_MODE_STEREO`.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the code change, it appears that the patch filters the audio modes in radio mode, keeping only MONO and STEREO modes. This change ensures V4L2 compliance for the saa7134 driver.

4. Impact:
   The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a compliance issue related to audio modes in radio mode.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address a real and critical issue. Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the initialization order of the hardware (HW) so that the interrupt is only requested after the HW is initialized. This can help avoid potential issues that may arise from requesting the interrupt before the HW is fully initialized.

2. The patch replaces the use of `irq_of_parse_and_map` with `platform_get_irq`. This change is likely made to improve code consistency and maintainability.

3. The patch also includes a reset of the SPI-HW block before requesting the interrupt. This ensures that the HW is in a known state before enabling the interrupt.

4. Finally, the patch registers the SPI master and handles any potential errors during the registration process.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses the initialization order of the HW and improves the handling of interrupts in the bcm2835aux SPI driver. However, it does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to convert the usage of `wait_for(I915_READ(reg))` to `intel_wait_for_register()` in the `assert_chv_phy_status()` function of the `i915` driver. It mentions that using `intel_wait_for_register()` improves efficiency and avoids code bloat.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch replaces the following code:
   ```c
   if (wait_for((tmp = I915_READ(DISPLAY_PHY_STATUS) & phy_status_mask) == phy_status, 10))
       WARN(phy_status != tmp,
            "Unexpected PHY_STATUS 0x%08x, expected 0x%08x (PHY_CONTROL=0x%08x)\n",
            tmp, phy_status, dev_priv->chv_phy_control);
   ```
   with:
   ```c
   if (intel_wait_for_register(dev_priv,
                               DISPLAY_PHY_STATUS,
                               phy_status_mask,
                               phy_status,
                               10))
       DRM_ERROR("Unexpected PHY_STATUS 0x%08x, expected 0x%08x (PHY_CONTROL=0x%08x)\n",
                 I915_READ(DISPLAY_PHY_STATUS) & phy_status_mask,
                 phy_status, dev_priv->chv_phy_control);
   ```

3. Analysis:
   The patch replaces the usage of `wait_for()` with `intel_wait_for_register()`. This change is aimed at improving efficiency and reducing code size. The new code uses `DRM_ERROR` instead of `WARN` to report the unexpected PHY_STATUS value.

4. Impact:
   The patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be an optimization and code cleanup change rather than addressing a critical issue.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix that does not address a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be exporting the `tegra_chip_id` variable in the ARM Tegra platform code. This change allows the powergating and reset handling code to differentiate between different Tegra variants.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a trivial change that exports a variable.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that the clock rates were set after the initialization of the timer, causing the timer to use the incorrect clock rate for the board.
2. The patch fixes this issue by moving the clock rate setting before the timer initialization.
3. The patch is signed-off by Hideki EIRAKU and Acked-by Kuninori Morimoto.
4. The patch is also signed-off by Simon Horman, who is the maintainer of the file being modified.
5. In the code changes, the `eva_clock_init()` function is moved from its original position to after the `shmobile_earlytimer_init()` function call in the `eva_earlytimer_init()` function.
6. The `eva_clock_init()` function is also removed from the `eva_init()` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to incorrect clock rates being used by the timer. The patch is also signed-off by relevant individuals and the maintainer. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a recommended alternative. The change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a typo and renames a function. The changes do not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function and resolves a sparse warning. It does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves moving a structure definition from one header file to another. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend that it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that encapsulates the boot vector code into a function for cpuidle. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial changes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the `dev_priv` field to the `struct intel_gmbus` in the `i915_drv.h` header file. This change allows the `dev_priv` pointer to be used in the `gmbus_xfer` and `intel_gmbus_force_bit` functions in the `intel_i2c.c` file.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `cx24123_pll_writereg()`. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing an unused argument), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a timeout for ramrod replies in the cnic driver for the bnx2x device.

2. The purpose of the timeout is to make forward progress and allow the bnx2x device to be reset if it encounters parity errors.

3. The patch modifies the function `cnic_bnx2x_destroy_ramrod` to use `wait_event_timeout` instead of `wait_event` to wait for the completion of the ramrod operation.

4. The patch also sets the timeout value to `CNIC_RAMROD_TMO`, which is defined as `(HZ / 4)` in `cnic.h`.

5. In the function `cnic_bnx2x_fcoe_destroy`, the patch adds a timeout for the completion of the FCoE connection termination.

6. The patch modifies the `wait_event` call to use `wait_event_timeout` and sets the timeout value to `CNIC_RAMROD_TMO`.

7. If the timeout occurs, the patch sets the `completion_status` of the `kcqe` structure to `FCOE_KCQE_COMPLETION_STATUS_ERROR`.

8. The patch also sets the `CTX_FL_DELETE_WAIT` flag and queues a delayed work task for connection deletion.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds a timeout mechanism to handle situations where the bnx2x device encounters errors during ramrod operations and FCoE connection termination. The timeout allows for forward progress and device reset if necessary.

Considering that this patch addresses potential issues related to device errors and provides a timeout mechanism, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current code ignores the failure of devm_clk_get for the core clock and explicitly sets it to NULL. This can lead to issues when querying other remaining clocks.

2. The patch proposes a cleaner approach: Instead of setting the core_clk to NULL, the patch suggests returning the failure when devm_clk_get fails for the core clock. This aligns with the cleaner way of expressing clock dependencies.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs and acknowledgments: It has been signed-off by Sarangdhar Joshi and reviewed by Stephen Boyd. It also has an acknowledgment from Bjorn Andersson.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a specific issue related to clock handling and does not include trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The change made in the patch modifies the value of `reply.reply_type` from 1 to 0. This change does not seem to fix any real or critical bug, but rather adjusts the response type for UP requests in the DRM DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (DP MST) code.

Since the patch does not address a critical issue and is a trivial fix, I would recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to memory allocation failure in the hpsa_get_device_id function in the hpsa.c file. The patch changes the return value from -1 to -ENOMEM when kzalloc fails to allocate memory.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a bug related to memory allocation failure, which can lead to potential issues such as crashes or data corruption.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Yes, the bug can potentially cause data corruption or other issues if memory allocation fails.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding hardware capability bits and feature tags to /proc/cpuinfo for the "Vector Packed Decimal Facility" and the "Vector Enhancements Facility 1" on the s390 architecture.

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds additional information to the /proc/cpuinfo file.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of adding new features or enhancements rather than addressing critical issues. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a clock for the FSI (Full Serial Interface) to the sh73a0 ARM-based platform. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch description does not provide any information about a bug or issue that it resolves. 

Since the patch does not seem to fix a critical bug, address a security issue, or resolve any significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "lpfc: Fix setting of EQ (interrupt) delay Multiplier". It suggests a fix for an issue related to setting the EQ (interrupt) delay multiplier in the lpfc driver.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the lpfc_sli4_queue_setup() function in the lpfc_init.c file. It adds a loop to configure the EQ delay multiplier for interrupt coalescing using the lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function. The lpfc_modify_fcp_eq_delay() function is also modified to accept a uint32_t parameter instead of a uint16_t parameter.

3. Impact:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the EQ delay multiplier, which can affect interrupt coalescing in the lpfc driver. However, the patch does not provide any information about the severity or impact of the issue it fixes.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether the issue fixed by this patch qualifies as a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers to determine the severity and impact of the issue and whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. As it stands, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) until more information is available.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a helper function addition in the tcp_input.c file. The purpose of this helper function is to prepare for the main RACK patch. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems to be adding hardware capabilities and structures for SR-IOV E-Switch in the mlx5 driver. However, without further information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix. Could you please provide additional information or a description of the problem that this patch aims to solve?
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix timeout issues in the QAT (QuickAssist Technology) driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch changes the data type of the variable "times" from "unsigned int" to "int" in three places: lines 389, 453, and 658. This change is necessary because the value of "times" should be -1 after the loop. This change seems reasonable and does not appear to be a trivial fix.

2. On line 402, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change ensures that the loop exits when "times" becomes negative. This change also seems appropriate and does not appear to be a trivial fix.

3. On line 467, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change ensures that the loop exits when "times" becomes negative. This change also seems reasonable and does not appear to be a trivial fix.

4. On line 658, the condition for the loop is changed from "!times" to "times < 0". This change ensures that the loop exits when "times" becomes negative. This change seems appropriate and does not appear to be a trivial fix.

Overall, the patch seems to address timeout issues in the QAT driver by correctly handling the "times" variable and loop conditions. It does not contain any trivial fixes and appears to fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a spelling mistake in the "greth.c" file. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches containing trivial fixes such as spelling changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that added a "drv_priv" pointer for driver use in the mac80211 subsystem. The reason for the revert is that no driver has been found to need this functionality, and the desired functionality has been implemented in a different way.

Since this patch is a revert and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bug, it can be considered a "trivial" change. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the "const" keyword from two SOC_ENUM_SINGLE_DECL declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

   - The dma_cap_set and od->ddev.device_prep_dma_memcpy updates ensure that the driver supports DMA_MEMCPY capability.
   - The od->ddev.directions update includes BIT(DMA_MEM_TO_MEM), indicating support for DMA memcpy operations.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch appears to add a new feature and improve the functionality of the bcm2835-dma driver. It also includes proper error handling and has been tested. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a warning related to a potentially uninitialized variable in the bcm2835_clock_choose_div_and_prate() function of the bcm2835 clock driver. 

Since this patch addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new event buffer cache in the DWC3 USB driver. The purpose of this cache is to copy triggered events from the event buffer and process them later in the bottom half handler. The patch also includes memory allocation for the cache.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   It is mentioned that the patch is needed to implement a workaround for a known erratum in recent DWC3 release. If this erratum causes a critical issue like a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, then the patch can be considered to fix a real and critical bug.

2. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a new functionality to address a specific issue.

Based on the provided information, it is not clear whether the erratum in the recent DWC3 release meets the criteria of a real and critical bug. Without further details about the nature and impact of the erratum, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch in Linux -stable releases until more information is available about the erratum and its impact.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for allocating multiple MSIs at the same time. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or feature addition rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch adds AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC, which brings reduced energy consumption and is a prerequisite for more advanced power-saving modes. This indicates that the patch addresses a power-saving issue, which can be considered important.

2. The patch mentions that AFTR mode support has already been implemented for other Exynos SoCs for a few years, and this patch adds support specifically for the Exynos3250 SoC. This suggests that the patch is adding functionality that has already been proven and tested on other SoCs.

3. The patch includes changes in the firmware.c file, specifically in the exynos_do_idle function. It adds conditional statements to handle the AFTR mode differently for the Exynos3250 SoC. This indicates that the patch is addressing specific differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC.

4. The patch also modifies the pm.c file, adding a conditional statement to set the wakeup mask differently for the Exynos3250 SoC. This suggests that the patch is addressing specific hardware differences in the Exynos3250 SoC.

5. The patch includes changes in the regs-pmu.h file, adding a new wakeup mask register (S5P_WAKEUP_MASK2) for the Exynos3250 SoC. This indicates that the patch is addressing specific hardware differences in the Exynos3250 SoC.

6. The patch includes changes in the smc.h file, adding two new secure firmware calls (SMC_CMD_SAVE and SMC_CMD_SHUTDOWN) for the Exynos3250 SoC. These calls are used to set the power state to idle before entering AFTR mode. This suggests that the patch is addressing specific firmware differences in the Exynos3250 SoC.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is addressing specific hardware and firmware differences in AFTR mode support for the Exynos3250 SoC. It introduces functionality that has already been proven on other SoCs and addresses power-saving concerns. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error in the `arch/mips/ath79/mach-ap136.c` file. The error is caused by passing too many arguments to the `ap136_pci_init` function. The patch modifies the function declaration to expect a `u8 *eeprom` argument.

Since this patch fixes a build error, it does not address a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant problem. Additionally, the change is a trivial fix as it only corrects the function declaration.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a call to `pwm_apply_args()` after requesting the PWM device. The comment in the code suggests that this is an intermediate state and that `pwm_apply_args()` should be removed once the atomic PWM infrastructure is in place and the driver makes use of it.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a trivial fix that can be considered a "spelling change" or "whitespace cleanup," it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the FSI DMAEngine in the ASoC subsystem. The patch ensures that the DMA is properly terminated at the start/stop time, which prevents noise on playback.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause audio playback issues. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to reclaim reboot state when the clientid is stale in NFSv4.0.
2. It adds the functionality to set NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED and reclaim reboot state for all v4.0 errors and recoverable errors on EXCHANGE_ID for v4.1.
3. It clears the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM bit and breaks the switch case for lease confirmation errors.
4. It clears the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_CONFIRM bit and calls the functions nfs4_state_clear_reclaim_reboot() and nfs4_state_start_reclaim_reboot() for stale clientid errors.
5. It handles the NFS4ERR_CLID_INUSE error by printing an error message.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to stale clientid in NFSv4.0. It introduces necessary changes to reclaim reboot state and handle errors appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function in the `ie6xx_wdt.c` file. The `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is currently annotated as `__devexit`, but it is called from `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` as part of its error cleanup path.

Looking at the patch, it seems that the `__devexit` annotation has been removed from both the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` functions. This change suggests that the functions are no longer intended to be used exclusively during device removal.

However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug or issue being fixed and its impact on the system's stability, security, or functionality. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if there are any alternative solutions or patches available.

Please provide more information about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch, and any other relevant details, so that I can make a more accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing `of_node_put` function call to decrement the reference count. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that marks the `rapl_ids` array as `__initconst`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the "pending" flag in the command structure. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `set_page_private` and `page_private` with `set_freepage_migratetype` and `get_freepage_migratetype` respectively. This change aims to make the code clearer.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it is a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unused "debug" module parameter from the cypress_m8.c USB serial driver. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes a parameter that does not have any effect, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability by using defined macros instead of hard-coding values. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing "break" statements in the ath5k_hw_set_spur_mitigation_filter function. This fix does not address any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code style cleanup in the rt2800lib.c file of the rt2x00 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial fix related to code formatting and style.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a pointless copy operation in the nfsd4_exchange_id function in the nfs4state.c file. The copy_verf function is no longer being called, and the verf variable is not being used further in the code.

Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused variables and corresponding lines. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of "trivial" fixes (removing unused variables), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function and replaces per_cpu_ptr() with this_cpu_ptr(). This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `hw_dbg` with `dev_info` for logging link up/down messages. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the mx51_clocks_init() function to a device tree (DT) call. This change is specific to the i.MX51 platform, which is becoming a DT-only platform. The patch removes the mx51_clocks_init() function and replaces it with mx51_clocks_init() as a DT call.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the use of __devinitdata. This change is related to the removal of the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option, which is no longer needed. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the dw_dmac driver. The patch addresses the issue of calling platform_get_drvdata twice unnecessarily by using the already available dw variable. 

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue in the driver, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding clock definitions for the SYS-DMAC modules on the Renesas R8A7796 platform. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce two new functions: `vm_entry_controls_reset_shadow` and `vm_exit_controls_reset_shadow`. These functions reset the shadow values of the entry and exit control fields in the VMCS.

The patch also modifies the `nested_vmx_vmexit` function to call these new functions instead of directly initializing the entry and exit control fields.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch for the mac80211 module in the Linux kernel. The patch removes a duplicate declaration of the `ieee80211_tdls_peer_del_work` function from the `ieee80211_i.h` header file.

Since this patch is a cleanup and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a variable from "pvRecvBuffer" to "recv_buf" in the wilc_mq_recv function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is simply a cosmetic change to improve variable naming consistency.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "KVM: s390: vsie: support host-protection-interruption". It suggests adding support for host-protection-interruption in the s390 virtualization implementation.

2. Acked-by: The patch has been acknowledged by Christian Borntraeger, indicating that it has received approval from at least one reviewer.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by David Hildenbrand and Christian Borntraeger, indicating that they take responsibility for the changes made in the patch.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the "shadow_scb" function in the "vsie.c" file. It adds a check to enable host-protection-interruption if the guest is allowed to use ESOP (Extended Supervisor Call Facility).

5. Impact: The patch introduces support for host-protection-interruption, which is a feature introduced with ESOP. This feature is only enabled if the guest is allowed to use ESOP. It modifies the "ecb" field of the "scb_s" structure based on the value of the "ecb" field in the "scb_o" structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds a new feature to the s390 virtualization implementation. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the key initialization of tcp_fastopen cookies to use net_get_random_once instead of get_random_bytes. This change ensures that if the user sets a custom key, net_get_random_once is called at least once to avoid overwriting the user-provided key when the first cookie is generated later on.

2. The patch adds a new function tcp_fastopen_init_key_once, which generates a dummy secret key but does not publish it. This is done to prevent regenerating a new key on the first invocation of tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen.

3. In the proc_tcp_fastopen_key function, the patch calls tcp_fastopen_init_key_once with the argument "false" to generate a dummy secret key without publishing it.

4. In the tcp_fastopen_cookie_gen function, the patch calls tcp_fastopen_init_key_once with the argument "true" to generate the actual key and publish it.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a non-trivial fix that improves the key initialization process for tcp_fastopen cookies.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The changes made in the patch involve replacing the assignment of `serial->private` with a direct allocation of memory using `kzalloc` and setting the `data` variable. Additionally, the usage of `usb_get_serial_data` is introduced to retrieve the `usb_wwan_intf_private` structure.

Since the patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue, and it only contains trivial changes, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds support for pause/resume functionality in cyclic DMA mode for the OMAP platform. It mentions that the audio stack used omap_stop_dma/omap_start_dma for pause/resume, which has been used for years on OMAP-based products. The patch states that pause/resume is only allowed when the DMA has been configured in cyclic mode, which is used by the audio stack.

2. Code Changes:
   - The 'struct omap_chan' structure is modified to include a new boolean variable 'paused' to track the pause/resume state.
   - The 'omap_dma_terminate_all' function is modified to avoid stopping the DMA twice if it is already paused.
   - The 'omap_dma_pause' function is added to handle the pause functionality. It checks if the DMA is configured in cyclic mode and if it is not already paused. If conditions are met, it stops the DMA and sets the 'paused' flag.
   - The 'omap_dma_resume' function is added to handle the resume functionality. It checks if the DMA is configured in cyclic mode and if it is already paused. If conditions are met, it starts the DMA and clears the 'paused' flag.
   - The 'omap_dma_control' function is not modified.

3. Analysis:
   The patch adds necessary functionality to support pause/resume in cyclic DMA mode for the OMAP platform. It ensures that pause/resume is only allowed when the DMA is configured in cyclic mode, which is consistent with the usage in the audio stack. The patch also avoids stopping the DMA twice and adds appropriate checks in the pause/resume functions.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical issue by adding support for pause/resume in cyclic DMA mode. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information and does not consider any potential interactions or dependencies with other parts of the Linux kernel. A thorough review and testing by kernel maintainers is still necessary before accepting the patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with buffer overflow in the mei_cl_device_probe() function in the drivers/misc/mei/bus.c file. The patch suggests two changes:

1. Replacing the use of strncpy() with strncmp() for string comparison. This change ensures that the final null terminator is not omitted during the comparison.
2. Using sizeof(id->name) instead of a fixed size (MEI_CL_NAME_SIZE) when copying the device name to id.name. This change ensures that the buffer is not overflowed.

Considering these changes, it seems that the patch addresses a potential bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "iwlwifi: mvm: BT Coex - disable RRC by default." It suggests disabling the RRC (Radio Resource Control) feature by default in the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices.

2. The patch checks if the firmware advertises support for the BT Coex RRC feature. If the firmware supports it, the feature will be enabled.

3. The patch modifies the "enum iwl_ucode_tlv_capa" enumeration in the iwl-fw-file.h header file to include a new capability flag, "IWL_UCODE_TLV_CAPA_BT_COEX_RRC," indicating support for BT Coex RRC.

4. The patch updates the "iwl_send_bt_init_conf_old" function in the coex_legacy.c file to use the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function to check if BT Coex RRC is supported by the firmware. If supported, the BT_COEX_RRC flag will be set in the bt_cmd->flags.

5. The patch adds the "iwl_mvm_bt_is_rrc_supported" function in the mvm.h file to check if BT Coex RRC is supported based on the firmware capabilities.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a new feature related to BT Coex RRC in the iwlwifi driver. It enables the feature only if the firmware supports it. Since it does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the blk-mq subsystem of the Linux kernel. The patch correctly frees the hctx->ctx_map inside the blk_mq_free_queue() function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding JPEG register definitions for the CODA7541 media platform driver. 

Since the patch is adding necessary register definitions for a specific hardware platform, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch title: staging/lustre/lnet: Properly mark userspace pointer of lnet_ping()
   - The patch aims to fix an issue related to marking the userspace pointer of lnet_ping() in the staging/lustre/lnet module.

2. Patch description:
   - The patch also addresses sparse warnings about different address spaces.
   - It includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating the authors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code changes:
   - Line 62: The function lnet_ping() is modified to change the type of the "ids" parameter from "lnet_process_id_t *" to "lnet_process_id_t __user *". This change properly marks the userspace pointer.
   - Line 1376: The modified lnet_ping() function is called with the "ids" parameter casted as "(lnet_process_id_t *)data->ioc_pbuf1". This line should be updated to pass "data->ioc_pbuf1" directly.
   - Line 1646: The lnet_ping() function is modified to change the type of the "ids" parameter from "lnet_process_id_t *" to "lnet_process_id_t __user *".

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to marking the userspace pointer of lnet_ping(). It does not seem to address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made in lines 1376 and 1646 are trivial and can be considered as cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to handle linkup/linkdown WMI events in the wil6210 driver for Qualcomm Atheros wireless devices. The patch adds two new event handlers, `wmi_evt_linkup` and `wmi_evt_linkdown`, which are responsible for handling linkup and linkdown events respectively.

The `wmi_evt_linkup` function is called when a linkup event is received from the firmware. It turns on the carrier for the network device associated with the wil6210 driver, indicating that the data path is ready.

The `wmi_evt_linkdown` function is called when a linkdown event is received from the firmware. It turns off the carrier for the network device, indicating that the link is no longer active.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to handling linkup/linkdown events in the wil6210 driver. It ensures that the carrier state of the network device is correctly updated based on the firmware events.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to unlocking on an error path in the `ieee80211_ibss_join()` function in the `ibss.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch adds a missing `mutex_unlock()` call before returning `-EINVAL` in case of a failure.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or errors, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in a stable release. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to constify the `def_qos_parameters` structure in the `rtl8192u` driver's `r8192U_core.c` file.
2. The `def_qos_parameters` structure is only passed as the source parameter to the `memcpy` function and its fields are never modified.
3. The Coccinelle script identifies the usage of `def_qos_parameters` in the `memcpy` function and suggests making it const.
4. The patch adds the `const` qualifier to the declaration of `def_qos_parameters`.
5. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix, as it only constifies a structure and does not address any critical issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a local variable from "nr_irqs" to "nr_irq" in two different files. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing forward declarations of structures in cpuidle.h. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the mediatek pinctrl driver. The patch ensures that the "configs" variable is properly freed before returning from the function in case of an error. 

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the gpio-ml-ioh driver. The patch modifies the ioh_gpio_get() function to ensure that the return value is clamped to [0,1] by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding entries in the HID table and referencing the "bytcht_da7213" driver. This patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the socket argument in the function `tcp_create_openreq_child()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the code in drivers/acpi/osl.c.
2. It changes the allocation function from kmalloc to kzalloc, which allocates and initializes memory to zero.
3. The patch adds comments to explain the purpose of the code and its relation to lockdep complaints.
4. It rearranges the code related to workqueues and initializes the work struct using INIT_WORK().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to improve code readability and prevent false positive lockdep complaints.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only moves the initialization of the 'status' variable within the function. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch adds platform device registration for the HDMI audio codec on OMAP4-based Pandaboard and PandaboardES boards. This registration allows for audio transmission through the HDMI output.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Instead, it adds functionality for audio transmission, which does not fall under the mentioned criteria.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ath6kl: configure SDIO when power is reapplied" and aims to fix an issue where all SDIO settings return to default when power is removed from the device. This suggests that the patch addresses a real and critical bug.

2. The patch is signed-off by James Minor and reviewed by Steve deRosier, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

3. The patch adds a new function called `ath6kl_sdio_config` at line 75, which is declared as static. This function is responsible for configuring the SDIO after power is reapplied.

4. At line 526, the `ath6kl_sdio_power_on` function is modified to call `ath6kl_sdio_config` after a delay of 10 milliseconds. If the configuration fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns the error code.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by reconfiguring the SDIO after power is reapplied. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a test for an impossible condition. The condition being removed is "tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID". Since this condition is impossible to satisfy, removing it does not fix a real and critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and purpose.

The patch is titled "drivers: sh: Enable PM runtime for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs" and it aims to enable PM (Power Management) runtime code for specific R-Car Gen2 SoCs. The PM runtime code is currently enabled for several R-Car Gen2 SoCs, but this patch adds support for three additional SoCs: r8a7792 (R-Car V2H), r8a7793 (R-Car M2-N), and r8a7794 (R-Car E2).

The patch modifies the `sh_pm_runtime_init()` function by adding checks for the compatibility of the machine with the three new SoCs. If the machine is compatible with any of these SoCs, the function will return 0, indicating successful initialization.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it adds support for new R-Car Gen2 SoCs, which can be considered an enhancement or a feature addition.

Since the patch does not address a critical issue and contains a non-trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, it may be suitable for inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel or other development branches.

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug in the code. The change replaces the return value of 0 with NULL in the host1x_bo_lookup() function. This change ensures that when the drm_gem_object_lookup() function returns NULL, the host1x_bo_lookup() function also returns NULL instead of 0.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or crashes, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to replace the usage of `hid_output_raw_report` with `hid_hw_output_report` in the `wiimote_hid_send` function in the `hid-wiimote-core.c` file.

2. The rationale behind this change is that the new API, `hid_hw_output_report`, is equivalent to the old API, `hid_output_raw_report`, for the Bluetooth (BT) transport layer.

3. The patch is signed-off by Benjamin Tissoires and reviewed by David Herrmann, indicating that it has undergone some level of review.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is not fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a change aimed at improving code readability or maintainability.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as containing a "trivial" fix, specifically a code cleanup or improvement. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with such changes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) This patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and modifies the functions "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" and "meson_i2c_probe" to accept the frequency as a parameter.

The rationale behind this patch is to set the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer. The bus frequency is fixed to what is set in the device tree (DT), so there is no need to set the clock divider for each transfer.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or code cleanup change.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the log level of error messages to debug messages. This change is aimed at preventing userspace from flooding the kernel log with error messages.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix. It only makes the variable "pseudo_primary" static in the scsi_debug.c file. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (changing variable scope), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing an unnecessary check before calling the `vfree()` function in the `asihpi_adapter_remove()` function of the `hpioctl.c` file in the ALSA asihpi driver. The patch claims that the `vfree()` function already performs input parameter validation, making the check redundant.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   It is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description whether this change fixes a bug. We need more information to determine if there is a bug related to the unnecessary check.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   Without more information, it is difficult to determine if the unnecessary check causes any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the available information, it is not clear whether this patch addresses a critical bug or fixes any significant issues. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further information is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only moves the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` to the file `smilsub.c` and removes the unnecessary declaration in `smilmain.c`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a trivial code reorganization, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. The patch sets the appropriate exit reason and suberror codes when instruction emulation fails, allowing for better error reporting to userspace.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical issue related to error reporting, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc` to accept a `struct msghdr *msg` parameter instead of `void *from`. This change allows the function to directly access the `msg` structure instead of relying on the `iov_iter.iov` field.

2. The patch replaces the call to `memcpy_fromiovecend` with `memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, msg->msg_iter.iov, 0, length)`. This change copies data from the `msg` structure's `msg_iter.iov` field to the `iph` buffer.

3. The patch also modifies the `rawv6_sendmsg` function to pass the `msg` structure directly to `rawv6_send_hdrinc` instead of casting it to `(struct iovec *)msg->msg_iter.iov`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making necessary changes to improve the handling of the `msg` structure in the `rawv6_send_hdrinc` function. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if the patch addresses a real and critical issue.

Therefore, based solely on the provided information, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the failure logging into the `isl29028_set_als_scale()` function to reduce code duplication in the driver.

2. It adds a `dev` variable to get the device associated with the `regmap` in `isl29028_set_als_scale()`.

3. It sets the `val` variable based on the `lux_scale` parameter.

4. It calls `regmap_update_bits()` to update the `ISL29028_REG_CONFIGURE` register with the `val` value.

5. If `regmap_update_bits()` returns an error, it logs the failure message using `dev_err()` and returns the error.

6. It updates the `chip->lux_scale` with the `lux_scale` parameter.

7. It returns the error code from `regmap_update_bits()` or success.

8. In the `isl29028_write_raw()` function, it calls `isl29028_set_als_scale()` with the `val` value obtained from the `val` parameter.

9. If `isl29028_set_als_scale()` returns an error, it logs the failure message using `dev_err()`.

10. In the `isl29028_chip_init_and_power_on()` function, it calls `isl29028_set_als_scale()` with the `chip->lux_scale` value.

11. If `isl29028_set_als_scale()` returns an error, it logs the failure message using `dev_err()`.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It only moves the failure logging and reduces code duplication. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a spelling mistake in two files: zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c. The change replaces "reseting" with "resetting" in two warning messages.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a function in the rtl8192e staging driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new function called "reset_shadow_stats" and moves some code into it. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only updates the initialization of the ".n_bitrates" field in the "mwifiex_band_2ghz" structure to use the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead of hardcoding the value.

Since this change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (a spelling change or whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" facility on the s390 architecture. This facility is being detected by setting the `has_ibs` flag in the `sclp_info` structure.

Since this patch is adding support for a new hardware facility, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` to check the device readiness. This function returns true if the device is ready and false otherwise. This seems to be a valid addition to handle device readiness.

2. The patch also sets the `dev_ready` function pointer of the `nand_chip` structure to `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready`. This ensures that the `dev_ready` function will be called when needed. This is a necessary change to properly handle device readiness.

3. Additionally, the patch sets the `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure to 50. This specifies the delay in microseconds between chip select and command execution. This value seems reasonable and can help ensure proper timing.

4. The patch also sets the `bbt_options` field of the `nand_chip` structure to `NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH`. This indicates that the bad block table should be stored in the flash memory. This is a valid configuration option.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces necessary changes to handle device readiness, timing, and configuration options. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure. This change is not critical and does not fix any real bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a cleanup or simplification of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change made in the patch is to set the `scanmask` value to `0xffff` in order to support NEC remotes with 24 or 32 bits. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the firmware image filename for the xc4000 tuner. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: tty: serial: Fix termios/port flags mismatch
   - The patch title suggests that it fixes a mismatch between termios and port flags in the serial driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - Uart port drivers may reconfigure termios settings based on available hardware support.
   - The patch ensures that the ASYNC_CTS_FLOW and ASYNC_CHECK_CD flags are set/cleared after calling the port driver's .set_termios method.
   - The patch reloads the cflag from termios as the port driver may have overridden the flags.
   - The patch aims to fix the mismatch between termios and port flags.

3. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a call to uport->ops->set_termios(uport, termios, old_termios) before setting the flags based on termios cflag.
   - The patch removes the previous call to uport->ops->set_termios(uport, termios, old_termios) that was placed after setting the flags.
   - The patch adds a line to reload the cflag from termios after calling uart_change_speed().

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real issue related to the mismatch between termios and port flags in the serial driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch moves the `qos_request` field from `saa7134_fh` structure to `saa7134_dev` structure.
   - The `qos_request` field is a global field, not a per-filehandle field.

2. Changes in saa7134-video.c:
   - Line 2205: The `pm_qos_add_request` function is modified to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.
   - Line 2220: The `pm_qos_remove_request` function is modified to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.

3. Changes in saa7134.h:
   - Line 472: The `qos_request` field is removed from the `saa7134_fh` structure.
   - Line 595: The `qos_request` field is added to the `saa7134_dev` structure.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is moving the `qos_request` field from a per-filehandle field to a global field. This change does not appear to fix a real and critical bug or address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the changes seem to be more of a code refactoring rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `scan_read_raw_oob` function in the `nand_bbt.c` file.

2. The patch adds code to handle the return value of `mtd->read_oob` function.

3. The added code checks if the return value is `-EUCLEAN` or `-EBADMSG`, which indicates ECC errors.

4. If the return value is not an ECC error, the patch returns the original return value.

5. If the return value is an ECC error, the patch returns 0, effectively ignoring the ECC errors.

6. The patch also modifies the `scan_block_fast` function in the same file.

7. Similar to the previous modification, the patch adds code to handle the return value of `mtd->read_oob` function.

8. The added code checks if the return value is an ECC error and returns the original return value if it is not.

9. If the return value is an ECC error, the patch returns 0, ignoring the ECC errors.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a change to ignore ECC errors when scanning for simple bad block markers. While ignoring ECC errors may be acceptable in this specific context, it is important to consider the potential impact on data integrity and system stability.

Given that the patch does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a real security issue, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would classify this patch as a non-critical improvement. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the initialization call for the "sibyte_bus_watcher" function from "__initcall" to "device_initcall". 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content.

The patch appears to be related to the mlx5 driver for Mellanox network adapters. It introduces a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` that allows setting the minimum inline header mode for virtual functions (VFs) on the physical function (PF) side.

The function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` takes the Mellanox device (`mdev`), the virtual port number (`vport`), and the minimum inline value (`min_inline`) as parameters. It initializes an input buffer `in` with the necessary fields and values to modify the NIC vport context. The `min_wqe_inline_mode` field in the `nic_vport_context` structure is set to the provided `min_inline` value. Finally, the function calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` with the input buffer to perform the modification.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or a security issue. The patch seems to introduce a new feature or functionality related to setting the minimum inline header mode for VFs. Without further context or information about the bug or issue it aims to fix, it is not possible to make a definitive decision.

Therefore, I cannot provide a clear recommendation at this point. It would be helpful to have additional details about the bug or issue this patch addresses to make an informed decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix the issue where the auto defragmentation process continues to run even when the file system is frozen. 

2. Impact: This issue can potentially lead to data corruption or other undesirable consequences if the auto defragmentation process modifies data while the file system is frozen.

3. Patch Analysis:
   - The patch adds two lines of code to the existing code in the `__btrfs_run_defrag_inode` function in `fs/btrfs/file.c`.
   - The `sb_start_write` function is called before the `btrfs_defrag_file` function, which indicates that the file system is being frozen.
   - The `sb_end_write` function is called after the `btrfs_defrag_file` function, which indicates that the file system is being unfrozen.

4. Patch Effectiveness: The added code ensures that the auto defragmentation process is not executed when the file system is frozen.

Based on the analysis, this patch addresses a real issue that can potentially lead to data corruption. It fixes the problem by preventing the auto defragmentation process from running when the file system is frozen. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the ternary operators using a GNU extension. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup and optimization of the ASoC adau17x1 CODEC driver. The patch removes the manual bias level transitions in the suspend and resume functions and instead sets the suspend_bias_off flag to true in the codec driver structure. This change makes the code shorter and cleaner.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adjusts the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. The changes do not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" and ".bus" fields from the b53_spi_driver structure. These fields are set automatically by the module_spi_driver() function. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the format string specifier for size_t variables in the HID cp2112 driver. The change replaces the use of "%d" with "%zd" in two debug print statements.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the "drm/nva3/fb/ram" file of the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the "nva3_ram_ctor" function in the "ramnva3.c" file.
2. It updates the initialization of several registers in the "ram" structure.
3. Three registers, namely "r_0x100760," "r_0x1007a0," and "r_0x1007e0," are changed from using the "ramfuc_reg" function to the "ramfuc_stride" function.
4. The "ramfuc_stride" function takes an additional argument, "ram->base.part_mask," which is a partition mask.
5. One more register, "r_0x1110e0," is also changed from using "ramfuc_reg" to "ramfuc_stride" with the partition mask.
6. The remaining register initializations are unchanged.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a change in how certain registers are initialized in the "nva3_ram_ctor" function. However, without further context or information about the purpose and impact of these changes, it is difficult to determine if they fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues.

Therefore, I would lean towards classifying this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) for now. Further investigation and clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers would be necessary to make a more informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event` in the ASoC twl6040 driver. This change is not related to fixing a real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue. It seems to be a cosmetic change to improve code clarity.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: ASoC: max98090: read micbias from device property
   - The patch aims to read the max98090 micbias from ACPI or device tree (DT).

2. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Fang, Yang A <yang.a.fang@intel.com> and Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>.

3. Changes in Documentation:
   - The patch adds a new property "maxim,micbias" to the sound/max98090.txt documentation file.
   - The property defines valid voltage values for the analog mic.

4. Code Changes:
   - In max98090_probe() function in max98090.c, the patch adds code to read the "maxim,micbias" property from the device.
   - If the property is not found, it sets the micbias to the default value of 2.8v and prints a dev_info message.
   - If the property is found but the value is out of the valid range, it sets the micbias to the default value of 2.8v and prints a dev_err message.
   - Finally, it updates the micbias value in the codec using snd_soc_update_bits().

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a real issue by adding support for reading the micbias from the device property. It also handles cases where the property is not found or has an invalid value. This patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue related to the micbias voltage, which can impact audio quality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit in the patch_hdmi.c file of the sound/pci/hda directory. The regression caused incorrect assignment of the pin NID.

The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Annie Liu from viatech.com.cn. It also includes a signed-off-by tag from Takashi Iwai, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by him.

The patch modifies the assignment of the pin NID in the patch_simple_hdmi() function. It replaces the incorrect assignment of spec->cvts[0].cvt_nid with the correct assignment of spec->pins[0].pin_nid.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause issues with HDMI audio playback. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it addresses a regression and involves modifying the code logic.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers: "dcssblk" and "xpram". The "owner" field is not necessary for platform drivers as it is automatically populated by the driver core.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary code.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture for the leon_callin() function. The warning indicates a mismatch between the __cpuinit and __init annotations for the leon_configure_cache_smp() function.

Since this patch addresses a warning related to section mismatch, it does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix.

According to the criteria mentioned earlier, which excludes trivial fixes, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the log level from `pr_info` to `pr_debug` for a success message. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves a spelling change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to define the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds definitions for the contiguous bit.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the "resiliency_test" function to the "init.text" section and marks it as "__init". This change is aimed at freeing up memory after boot since the function is only called during the bootstrap process.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. This is a functional enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant NULL check and a check for DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value in the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: iwlwifi: nvm: init correct nvm channel list for 8000 devices
   - The patch title suggests that it fixes an issue related to initializing the correct nvm channel list for 8000 devices.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch fixes a problem where the regulatory data mistakenly contains only 7000 series channels.
   - It updates the function `iwl_parse_nvm_mcc_info` to initialize the correct nvm channel list for 8000 series devices.
   - The patch includes changes in `iwl-nvm-parse.c`, `iwl-nvm-parse.h`, and `mac80211.c` files.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific issue related to incorrect initialization of the nvm channel list for 8000 series devices.
   - It ensures that the regulatory data contains the correct channels for these devices.
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
   - It seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or regulatory compliance issues.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to initializing the correct nvm channel list for 8000 series devices.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to replace the homebrewed code for setting IRQ affinity with the core function `irq_set_affinity()` and switch to using `for_each_active_irq()` instead of iterating over all IRQ descriptors.

2. The patch is signed-off by Thomas Gleixner and James Hogan, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The patch removes the `route_irq()` function, which was used to set the IRQ affinity for a specific IRQ and CPU. Instead, it directly calls `irq_set_affinity()` with the IRQ number and the desired CPU affinity.

4. The `migrate_irqs()` function is modified to use `for_each_active_irq()` to iterate over all active IRQs and retrieve the corresponding `irq_data` structure. It then sets the IRQ affinity using `irq_set_affinity()`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a clean and straightforward improvement. It replaces custom code with the core function `irq_set_affinity()` and simplifies the IRQ migration logic. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of code cleanup and optimization rather than fixing a real and critical bug. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the `imp_known_replied_xid` when trying to resend an already replied replay request.
2. The reason for updating `imp_known_replied_xid` is that the xid of the replay request could be less than the current `imp_known_replied_xid`.
3. The patch is signed-off by Niu Yawei and Oleg Drokin, and reviewed by Alex Zhuravlev and Fan Yong.
4. The patch is associated with an Intel bug ID and has been reviewed on a code review platform.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to replaying requests in the Lustre staging driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves updating a critical variable (`imp_known_replied_xid`) based on the conditions mentioned.

However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the issue is critical enough to warrant inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, it is important to consider the impact and potential risks associated with the patch.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision without more information. If you can provide additional details about the bug being fixed and its impact, I can reassess and provide a more accurate recommendation.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds module alias autogeneration for AMBA drivers in the nomadik-rng.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which only fixes a trivial typo in a comment, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the fix does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary assignment to the variable "mq_rq" in the function "mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq". This assignment is not used after the jump, and it seems to be confusing and unnecessary.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code optimization for ARMv6 and later processors. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend giving it a (B) NAK.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds a missing `of_node_put` function call after calling `of_parse_phandle`. The purpose of `of_node_put` is to release the reference to the device node obtained from `of_parse_phandle` when it is no longer needed.

2. Patch Impact:
   This patch addresses a potential resource leak issue by properly releasing the device node reference. If the `of_node_put` function is not called, it could lead to a resource leak and potential memory issues.

3. Patch Sign-offs:
   The patch has been signed-off by Peter Chen and Daniel Vetter, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Patch Link:
   The patch link provided points to the patch on the patchwork website, which provides additional context and discussion around the patch.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential resource leak issue and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "__init" annotation from the "gpmc_hwecc_bch_capable" function. This annotation is dropped to prevent section mismatches when the "gpmc_nand_init" function is called from another driver's probe function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The changes in the patch mainly involve converting the set_frontend and get_frontend functions to use DVBv5 parameters instead of the dvb_frontend_parameters struct.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains only trivial changes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new mfd cell for the power button part of the axp288 PMICs. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

However, the provided patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses. It seems to be adding support for a new feature or device. 

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug or address a significant issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, which renames the type PVOID to "void *" in Misc.c, it appears to be a trivial fix involving a simple renaming of a type. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch is simply replacing the individual calls to `platform_driver_register` and `platform_driver_unregister` with the new helper functions `platform_register_drivers` and `platform_unregister_drivers`. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve moving the `err_request_irq` label up to reflect the order of operations.

Since this patch does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it is considered a trivial fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch introduces a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to indicate that a set contains expressions for evaluation. It also adds a check to reject sets that specify both mapping and evaluation operations.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific adaptation for the OMAP3-based igep0020 board to accommodate changes in the ehci-omap driver. 

The patch introduces changes to the initialization of USB PHY data and the USBHS platform data for the igep0020 board. It registers the PHY's RESET regulators and the NOP PHY devices using the `usbhs_init_phys()` function. Additionally, it modifies the `igep2_usbhs_bdata` and `igep3_usbhs_bdata` structures to set the appropriate port modes and reset GPIOs.

Since the patch does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Furthermore, the changes seem to be specific to the igep0020 board and may not have broader applicability.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for port mirroring in the bcm_sf2 driver for DSA switches. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

First, let's check if the patch fixes a real and critical bug. The patch description does not mention any specific bug being fixed, so it is unclear if it addresses a critical issue.

Next, we need to assess if the patch causes any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. The patch only adds support for port mirroring, which is not inherently a critical issue or a security vulnerability.

Lastly, we need to verify if the patch contains any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Since the patch only adds new functionality and does not mention any trivial fixes, we can assume it does not contain any.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the vmwgfx driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "vmwgfx: Unreference surface on cursor error path." This suggests that it addresses an error path related to the handling of surfaces in the vmwgfx driver.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line from the author, Jakob Bornecrantz, indicating that they take responsibility for the changes made in the patch.

3. The patch also includes a "Reviewed-by" line from Thomas Hellstrom, indicating that the changes have been reviewed by another developer.

4. The "Signed-off-by" line from Dave Airlie suggests that he has also reviewed and approved the changes.

5. Looking at the code changes, we see that on line 111, an error message is printed if a surface is not suitable for use as a cursor. The patch then adds a call to "vmw_surface_unreference" to unreference the surface before returning an error.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real issue related to the handling of surfaces in the vmwgfx driver. It adds necessary error handling and cleanup code to prevent potential issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a superfluous check and a stray newline. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue. The patch only modifies the declaration of a structure to make it const and moves some data to text. This change does not seem to fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional details such as the impact of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a security risk. Additionally, I would need to verify that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without this information, I cannot definitively say whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in a stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for improving the validation of sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance values. The patch ensures that negative values cannot be directly written by users.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of an improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a discrepancy between IPv4 and IPv6 behavior. In IPv4, when a machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

2. The patch modifies the UDP error handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. When the machine receives an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message, the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

3. The patch includes the necessary code changes in the `__udp6_lib_err` function in `net/ipv6/udp.c`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug in the IPv6 implementation. It ensures consistent behavior between IPv4 and IPv6 for UDP sockets when receiving ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG messages. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to error handling in the tty driver. The patch changes the return value from -ENOIOCTLCMD to -ENOTTY when the ioctl operation is not supported by the driver.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses an issue where the errno value returned to user mode is incorrect when an unsupported ioctl command is used. While this may not be a critical bug, it is a real issue that affects the correctness of error reporting.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   No, the bug does not cause any of the mentioned issues. It is more of an incorrect error reporting issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? 
   No, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to error handling.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. However, it is important to note that the final decision lies with the maintainers and reviewers of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of __devexit_p. This macro is no longer needed because CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing the "bright_max" variable and directly setting the maximum brightness value in the led_classdev structure. This change eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in the brightness_set() function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather improves the efficiency of the code by removing unnecessary calculations, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific performance bottleneck issue when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in qemu. The patch sets the CmdQue bit in the standard INQUIRY data to 1.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific performance optimization for a particular use case.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and renaming of the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()`. The patch also moves the reference acquisition into the `init_and_link_css()` function.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer function and renames it to __prandom_start_seed_timer. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the code to use devm_ functions. This type of change is typically considered a "trivial" fix and does not address any real or critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `regmap_init_i2c()` with `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. This change makes error handling and code cleanup simpler and also fixes a potential bug by adding an explicit `regmap_exit` call.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch adds the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Anton Blanchard and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.

3. Cc: The patch is also copied to several individuals, including Ingo Molnar, Jiri Olsa, Namhyung Kim, Paul Mackerras, and Peter Zijlstra.

4. Link: The patch includes links to the original message and the patch itself.

5. Code Changes: The patch modifies the vmlinux_path__init() function in the symbol.c file.

6. Line 1757: The patch increases the size of the vmlinux_path array from 5 to 6.

7. Line 1788: The patch adds a new entry to the vmlinux_path array, containing the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file.

8. Line 1793: The patch adds another entry to the vmlinux_path array, containing the path to the vmlinux file in the kernel build directory.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a valid fix for adding the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and addresses a real issue related to symbol resolution in perf. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the code. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the init() and exit() platform callbacks in the serial-imx driver.

2. It replaces the moboard_uart0_init() function with moboard_uart0_init(void) and removes the gpio_request() return value check.

3. The moboard_uart0_init() function now directly calls gpio_direction_output() without checking its return value.

4. The moboard_uart0_exit() function is removed, and the gpio_free() call is moved inside moboard_uart0_init().

5. The uart0_pdata.init and uart0_pdata.exit fields are removed from the imxuart_platform_data structure.

6. The moboard_uart0_init() function is called in mx31moboard_init().

7. The serial_imx_probe() function no longer checks for pdata->init() and directly calls uart_add_one_port().

8. The serial_imx_remove() function no longer checks for pdata->exit() and directly calls uart_remove_one_port().

Based on this analysis, it appears that this patch removes the init() and exit() platform callbacks and simplifies the initialization and removal process for the moboard_uart0 device. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs or address any "oh, that's not good" issues. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rt2800: initialize BBP_R103 on all subroutines (except 5592)". This suggests that it aims to initialize a specific register (BBP_R103) in the rt2800 driver.

2. The patch includes changes to the `rt2800_init_bbp_305x_soc`, `rt2800_init_bbp_28xx`, `rt2800_init_bbp_30xx`, `rt2800_init_bbp_3290`, `rt2800_init_bbp_3352`, `rt2800_init_bbp_3390`, `rt2800_init_bbp_3572`, `rt2800_init_bbp_53xx`, and `rt2800_init_bbp_5592` functions in the `rt2800lib.c` file.

3. In each of these functions, there are additional lines added to set the value of BBP_R103 to either 0x00 or 0xc0, depending on certain conditions.

4. The conditions for setting BBP_R103 to 0xc0 are based on the revision of the rt2x00 device being used. If the device is one of RT3070, RT3071, RT3090, or RT3390, or if it is RT3290, RT3352, RT3572, RT5390, RT5392, or RT305x SoC, then BBP_R103 is set to 0xc0. Otherwise, it is set to 0x00.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch aims to initialize the BBP_R103 register in the rt2800 driver based on the device being used. This initialization seems to be necessary for proper functioning of the driver.

Considering that the patch addresses a specific bug related to device initialization and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sizeimage setting in the coda driver for the media subsystem. The patch updates the calculation of sizeimage in the vidioc_try_fmt function and also simplifies the calculation in the vidioc_s_fmt function.

The original code incorrectly calculated sizeimage as the product of height and bytesperline, instead of width, height, and the factor 3/2 for YUV420 format. The patch corrects this by calculating sizeimage as width * height * 3 / 2.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to address a real issue that could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect image processing. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch appears to be related to the staging driver for the vt6656 wireless chipset.
2. The patch replaces the usage of the DEVICE_PARAM macro for setting the number of transmit USB descriptor buffers with the module_param_named macro.
3. It introduces a new module parameter named "tx_buffers" to set the number of receive USB transmit buffers.
4. The patch also adds a check to ensure that the user does not set the tx_buffers value beyond the defined limits of the driver.
5. In the device_set_options function, the patch updates the assignment of priv->cbTD (number of transmit buffers) based on the value of vnt_tx_buffers.
6. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by lines.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a change in the configuration options for the vt6656 driver.

Additionally, the patch contains a mistake where it uses "vnt_rx_buffers" instead of "vnt_tx_buffers" in the module_param_named macro, which suggests that it may not have been thoroughly reviewed.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of non-device managed APIs with their device managed counterparts. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring or cleanup rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the u3 MPIC MSI subsystem to use the `pci_controller_ops` structure instead of `ppc_md` for MSI-related PCI controller operations.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function call with a recommended one. The change does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or address a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to avoid an unnecessary register read in the i40e_virtchnl_pf.c file.

2. Change-Id: The Change-Id is provided for tracking purposes and does not provide any information about the patch's suitability for stable releases.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by multiple developers from Intel, indicating their agreement with the changes.

4. Tested-by: The patch has been tested by Sibai Li from Intel, indicating that it has undergone testing.

5. Code Changes: The code changes involve removing the unnecessary register read and using the vf_base_id from the hardware structure instead.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a performance optimization or a minor improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary.
2. The function scsi_run_queue is split into two parts: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue.
3. The scsi_starved_list_run function is responsible for selecting a proper request queue to serve next.
4. The scsi_run_queue function is responsible for starting a new command if possible.
5. The scsi_single_lun_run function is called if the scsi_target has a single LUN.
6. The scsi_starved_list_run function is called if the starved_list is not empty.
7. Finally, the blk_run_queue function is called to run the queue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the efficiency of scsi_run_queue by avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and splitting the function for better clarity. It also handles single LUN and starved_list cases appropriately.

Considering that the patch addresses a potential performance improvement and does not introduce any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that focuses on renaming a function and tidying up the code formatting. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, the patch should not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field from the "sl811h_driver" structure in the "sl811-hcd.c" file. The patch claims that there is no need to set the ".owner" field explicitly as the core will handle it automatically.

Since this patch only removes a single line of code and does not fix any real or critical bug, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the NO_IRQ initializer from the .irq field in the struct amba_device. This change removes the unnecessary NO_IRQ value from the .irq field, which suggests that it was not required or used.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the platform data for SPI bus clocks in the ARM Samsung architecture. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only removes some platform data, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a helper function `l3mdev_master_ifindex_by_index` to lookup the l3mdev master index given a device index.

2. The function first checks if the given `ifindex` is non-zero. If it is zero, it returns 0 immediately.

3. If the `ifindex` is non-zero, it acquires an RCU read lock and calls `dev_get_by_index_rcu` to get the network device corresponding to the given `ifindex`.

4. If the device is found, it calls `l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu` to get the master index of the device.

5. Finally, it releases the RCU read lock and returns the master index if the device was found, or 0 otherwise.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary helper function to perform a lookup of the l3mdev master index by device index. This functionality can be useful for various network-related operations.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real functionality improvement, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an uninitialized variable warning. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming variables and adjusting indentation. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix to silence an integer overflow warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) subsystem, specifically the Realtek audio driver (patch_realtek.c). It involves moving a quirk for the ALC255 audio codec on Dell systems.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it removes two SND_PCI_QUIRK entries for ALC255_FIXUP_DELL2_MIC_NO_PRESENCE and adds a new SND_HDA_PIN_QUIRK entry for the same fixup. The new entry includes specific pin configurations for the Dell ALC255 codec.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug being fixed. However, since the patch involves a quirk related to microphone presence on Dell systems, it suggests that it could potentially address an issue related to audio input.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in -stable releases, if this patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it could be considered for inclusion. However, if the fix is trivial, such as a spelling change or whitespace cleanup, it should not be accepted.

Without further information about the bug being fixed and its severity, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided patch content, it seems to address a specific issue related to microphone presence on Dell systems, which could potentially be critical for affected users. Therefore, I would lean towards accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the rt2x00pci driver in the Linux kernel. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

The patch primarily adds support for using PCI MSIs (Message Signaled Interrupts) whenever possible. While this can improve performance and efficiency, it does not fix any critical issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a fix for a critical issue. As a result, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
1. The patch fixes a type mismatch issue in the `capi20_manufacturer` function. The function is declared with an `unsigned int` argument, but it is called with an `unsigned long` argument. This type mismatch can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or bugs.
2. The patch corrects the function prototype to match the actual argument type used in the function call. This ensures that the function is correctly defined and used as part of the user-visible API.
3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating that it has undergone a review process.
4. The issue was spotted with Coverity, which suggests that it has been identified as a potential problem that needs fixing.
5. The change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, considering the nature of the fix and the provided information, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a duplicate error message. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused macro. The macro "IS_MAC_ADDRESS_BROADCAST" is no longer used in the code and is being removed. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch increases the required skbuff headroom for firmware signaling in preparation for a firmware signaling feature. This indicates that it is addressing a specific functionality or feature improvement.

2. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple individuals from Broadcom, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

3. The patch modifies the structure `struct brcmf_proto_bdc_header` to include additional fields related to firmware signaling.

4. It introduces a new macro `BRCMF_PROT_FW_SIGNAL_MAX_TXBYTES` to define the maximum length of firmware signal data in the transmit path.

5. The patch updates the `brcmf_proto_attach` function to increase the `drvr->hdrlen` value by the sum of `BDC_HEADER_LEN` and `BRCMF_PROT_FW_SIGNAL_MAX_TXBYTES`. This indicates that the patch is modifying the behavior of this function to accommodate the increased headroom required for firmware signaling.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing changes related to firmware signaling and increasing the required skbuff headroom. However, without further context or information about the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch qualifies as a real and critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would lean towards classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until more information is provided about the bug or issue it is intended to fix.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a "name" field to the omapdss's outputs in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial change that adds a name for debugging purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS flag in the samples/seccomp/dropper.c file. This flag is required to enable seccomp, and the patch allows the dropper program to be run without requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges.

However, it is important to note that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a critical fix.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. Patch description: "drm/exynos: fix buffer pitch calculation"
   This indicates that the patch aims to fix a bug related to buffer pitch calculation in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem for Exynos GPUs.

2. Signed-off-by lines:
   - Cooper Yuan <cooperyuan@gmail.com>
   - Inki Dae <inki.dae@samsung.com>
   - Kyungmin Park <kyungmin.park@samsung.com>

   These lines indicate the authors who have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the calculation of the buffer pitch in the exynos_drm_gem_dumb_create() function.

   Before the patch:
   ```
   args->pitch = args->width * args->bpp >> 3;
   ```

   After the patch:
   ```
   args->pitch = args->width * ((args->bpp + 7) / 8);
   ```

   The patch changes the calculation of the pitch by adding 7 to args->bpp before dividing it by 8. This change ensures that the pitch is correctly calculated when the bpp (bits per pixel) is not a multiple of 8.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific bug related to buffer pitch calculation in the Exynos DRM driver. It fixes a potential issue where the pitch calculation could be incorrect when the bpp is not a multiple of 8. This bug could lead to data corruption or display artifacts.

   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption or display artifacts. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial changes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "regulators" array in the lp3972.c file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple code cleanup by making the array read-only.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable atomic fb-helper support in the i915 driver. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue.

In this case, the patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue that it fixes. It seems to be enabling a feature (atomic fb-helper) in the i915 driver. Without further context or information, it is difficult to determine if this feature is critical or necessary for stable releases.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. However, it is worth noting that the patch does not address any specific bug or issue, which raises concerns about its significance.

Based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless there is additional context or information that demonstrates its criticality or necessity for stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for error handling in the hdmi_probe_pdata() function. The patch adds proper error handling and returns appropriate error codes instead of simply returning without any indication of failure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an issue related to resource availability during the probe process.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for spurious interrupts on SDIO controllers found on Marvell Kirkwood SoCs. The patch checks if any interrupts are expected and bails out early if not, to avoid a warning later.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to spurious interrupts, which may not fall under the mentioned categories.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the qla2xxx SCSI driver. The patch modifies the qla2x00_gpn_id, qla2x00_gnn_id, and qla2x00_gfpn_id functions to stop iteration after the first failure. This change is made by introducing a break statement after setting the rval variable to QLA_FUNCTION_FAILED.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine whether the bug is critical or meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. However, based solely on the patch itself, it does not seem to address a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless additional information is provided to demonstrate its criticality or significance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing inline wrappers for nla_get_le32 and nla_get_le64 functions in the netlink subsystem. These functions are required to provide fields for nl802154 userspace applications.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial fix that adds missing inline wrappers for specific data types.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated macro DEFINE_PCI_DEVICE_TABLE() with the recommended usage of 'struct pci_device_id'. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing a deprecated macro), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The patch adds a call to `phy_suspend` when the `phydev` enters the HALTED state. However, there is no indication that this change fixes any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some unused #defines from the wlan_bssdef.h file in the staging driver for the rtl8723au wireless chipset. The removed #defines are related to NDIS_802_11_STATUS_TYPE and NDIS_802_11_AUTH_REQUEST, which are not used anywhere else in the code.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only removes unused code, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to refactor the code of the `soft_offline_page()` function in the `mm/memory-failure.c` file. It addresses the issue of multiple return points randomly intermingled with some "goto done" return points, making the code structure less clear. The patch adjusts the function structure to have separate paths for success and failure, improving code readability.

Additionally, the patch replaces the usage of `atomic_long_add` with `atomic_long_inc` for incrementing the `mce_bad_pages` counter, which is a more appropriate function for incrementing a counter by 1.

The changes made in the patch do not fall under the category of "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Instead, they improve code structure and use a more appropriate function for incrementing a counter.

Therefore, considering that the patch addresses code clarity and correctness without introducing any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary out-of-memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for checking the return values of the nla_parse() function. The patch ensures that the policy is not useless and that the attributes are actually what is expected. It also handles potential errors by returning the appropriate error code.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `of_find_property` with `of_property_read_u32` for reading integer values. This change helps reduce the number of variables used.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a call to `seq_printf` with `seq_puts` for a specific string. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the i40e driver in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions in the i40e driver.

2. The change updates the functions to take a u16 (unsigned 16-bit integer) instead of an s16 (signed 16-bit integer) as an argument. This change is necessary because the functions no longer expect to be called with VID=I40E_VLAN_ANY.

3. Additionally, the patch adds a check in both functions to ensure that the VID is not zero and that the PVID (Port VLAN ID) is not set. If either condition is true, the functions return an error (-EINVAL).

4. The patch also updates the function documentation to reflect the changes made.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to VLAN handling in the i40e driver. It introduces necessary checks to prevent incorrect usage of the functions and potential issues with VLAN mode handling. The changes do not appear to be trivial, and they aim to fix a potential bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `cpia1.c` file of the `gspca` driver in the `drivers/media/usb` directory. The patch converts a nonnegative error return code to a negative one, which is consistent with the return values used elsewhere in the function.

Since this patch addresses an error return code, it can potentially fix a bug that may cause issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption. However, without further context or information about the specific bug being addressed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the bug.

Considering the patch itself, it does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on modifying the return value of the `do_command` function call.

Based on the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it seems to fix a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug being addressed would be necessary for a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the NVRAM location from 14 to 16 for reading the SCSI host ID. This change is based on documentation and confirmed by testing.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific hardware issue related to the RT5645 codec. The patch adds support for the ACPI ID "10EC5640" and includes a DMI quirk for jack detection.

   Yes, the patch addresses a specific hardware issue related to the RT5645 codec on certain CHT platforms. This can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   The patch does not introduce any of the mentioned issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.)? 
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where a null pointer is dereferenced in the original code. The patch introduces a new label "no_endpoints" and changes the "goto error" statement to "goto no_endpoints" when the memory allocation fails.

Since the patch addresses a potential null pointer dereference, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused code and removes setting the gadget name in the driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code and making a minor change, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to change the discharge state from RECOVERY to INIT_RECOVERY when the charger is removed.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Martin Bergstrom and Lee Jones, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. Reviewed-by: The patch has also been reviewed by Marcus COOPER and Jonas ABERG, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. Tested-by: The patch has been tested by Jonas ABERG in the drivers/power/ab8500_fg.c file.

5. Code Changes: The code changes involve modifying the discharge state from AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_RECOVERY to AB8500_FG_DISCHARGE_INIT_RECOVERY.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a specific behavior related to the charger removal and the discharge state. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant stakeholders to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to "unclaimed register" messages on Haswell after suspend/resume. The patch checks the generation of the Intel GPU and only saves/restores the DSPARB register if the generation is less than or equal to 4.

Since the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary Out-of-Memory (OOM) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue), and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the cs53l30 codec driver in the ASoC subsystem. The patch sets the `idle_bias_off` option to true, which ensures that the DAPM core sets the bias level to `SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF` instead of stopping at `SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY`. This change is intended to control the power on and off sequences correctly.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to power management in the codec driver, it does not seem to be a trivial fix. It does not involve spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other minor modifications. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the route names in the nau88l25_max98357a machine for Skylake. This patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a simple renaming of the routes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a direct comparison with a macro. The change itself does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to power management for the RX-51 board. It does not address any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the TX wakeup bit for the wer register in OMAP2+ UART.

2. It populates the necessary TX wakeup flag for the applicable module IP blocks and uses it while configuring the wer register.

3. It restores the wer register when context is lost.

4. It adds a new feature flag OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP.

5. It modifies the struct uart_omap_port to include a new member 'wer' and 'features'.

6. In the serial_omap_startup function, it sets the wer register with OMAP_UART_WER_MOD_WKUP and enables the TX wakeup bit if the OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP feature flag is set.

7. In the omap_serial_fill_features_erratas function, it sets the OMAP_UART_WER_HAS_TX_WAKEUP feature flag based on the UART revision.

8. In the serial_omap_restore_context function, it restores the wer register.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding a new feature and making some enhancements to the OMAP2+ UART driver. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds a new netdev operation to allow or prevent a Virtual Function (VF) from querying its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It is limited to 82599 and x540 devices for now, with support for other devices to be added later.

2. Code Changes:
   - In ixgbe.h, a new boolean variable `rss_query_enabled` is added to the `vf_data_storage` structure.
   - In ixgbe_main.c, the `ixgbe_configure_virtualization` function enables or disables the RSS query feature for each VF based on the `rss_query_enabled` value.
   - In ixgbe_netdev_ops, the `ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en` function is added to handle enabling or disabling the RSS query feature for a VF.
   - In ixgbe_sriov.c, the `__ixgbe_enable_sriov` function sets the `rss_query_enabled` value to 0 for all VFs, limiting the querying to 82599 and x540 devices.
   - In ixgbe_sriov.h, the `ixgbe_ndo_set_vf_rss_query_en` function is declared.

3. Analysis:
   This patch introduces a new feature to control the ability of a VF to query its RSS Indirection Table and RSS Hash Key. It limits the support to specific devices and provides a netdev operation to enable or disable the feature for each VF.

   Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific functionality related to RSS querying for VFs on certain devices. However, it does not mention any critical bug fixes, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes appear to be adding a new feature rather than fixing an existing issue.

   Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or analysis.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "mmc: sunxi: Gate the clock when rate is 0". It suggests that the MMC core assumes the clock should be gated when the bus frequency is set to 0, and this behavior has been ignored so far. The patch aims to handle this situation.

2. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the `sunxi_mmc_clk_set_rate` function and the `sunxi_mmc_set_ios` function in the `sunxi-mmc.c` file.

3. Analysis:
   - In the `sunxi_mmc_clk_set_rate` function, the patch adds a check to return early if the `ios->clock` value is 0 (indicating a 0 bus frequency).
   - In the `sunxi_mmc_set_ios` function, the patch removes the check for `ios->clock` before setting up the clock. Now, the clock setup is performed regardless of the `ios->clock` value.

4. Evaluation:
   - The patch addresses a specific behavior related to clock gating when the bus frequency is set to 0.
   - It does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.
   - The changes made by the patch do not seem to introduce any trivial fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.).

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or a significant issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the number of interrupts managed by the TWL4030 from 8 to 34. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward frequency range extension for the Max2165 tuner driver in the Linux kernel. This patch does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a trivial fix that extends the frequency range to cover Hong Kong's digital TV broadcasting.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a configuration issue related to antenna diversity for non-AR9485 chips in the ath9k driver. The patch modifies the values used for antenna diversity configuration based on the chip type.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific configuration issue for non-AR9485 chips, which may fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, since the patch does not fix a critical bug and does not introduce any significant changes, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix related to parenthesis alignment in the ppdev.c file. The patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix for enabling the Kirkwood audio driver on mvebu platforms, specifically the Armada 370 variant. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a real issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if this patch has been tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers and if it has been successfully applied and tested on the affected platforms.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the 'thisboard' macro, which relies on a local variable with a specific name and yields a pointer derived from that local variable.
2. The macro is replaced with local variables and the use of the comedi_board() helper function to obtain the pointer.
3. The patch also includes some cleanup and attachment code changes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is addressing a code improvement rather than fixing a real and critical bug. It does not appear to fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the fec driver in the Linux kernel. It introduces a new property "phy-reset-duration" in the device tree to allow boards to specify the duration of the phy reset. This is important because different boards may require different reset durations.

The patch also includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not longer than 1 second, which is a reasonable limit. If the duration is not specified in the device tree, it defaults to 1 millisecond.

Since this patch addresses a real issue and provides a necessary enhancement, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting pointer math to array access. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that constifies the "nct7802_regmap_config" structure in the "hwmon/nct7802.c" file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves enabling and disabling interrupts in the meson-gx-mmc driver. The patch removes the interrupt handling code from the meson_mmc_request function and moves it to the probe and remove functions.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb_probe() function in the staging driver for XGI graphics. The "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed due to the removal of the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a compile warning in the ARM architecture's PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface) implementation. The patch simply adds a return statement with a value of 0 to the `psci_init` function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some unnecessary checks. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch is simply optimizing the code by avoiding redundant function calls. Since it does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a redundant type casting. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a minor code cleanup, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to endianness in the powerpc architecture. The patch modifies the code to use the `of_read_number` function instead of directly accessing the device tree properties as `u32` pointers.

Since this patch addresses a potential bug related to endianness and ensures proper handling of device tree properties, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a pointer to `musb` from the `tusb_omap_dma` structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that makes the functions `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only modifies the function visibility, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a line length issue in the serqt_usb2.c file. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding missing clocks for various MIPS platforms. However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial fix that adds missing clocks.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a potential informational message issue. The patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch replaces the direct comparison of jiffies with a more robust time_before function, which improves the reliability of comparing jiffies against other values.

Since this change enhances the code's robustness and does not involve any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only modifies the struct device pointer to point to the USB device instead of the input device.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the mmc_ext_csd_open function in the debugfs code of the MMC driver. The patch removes the BUG_ON statement and replaces it with proper error handling.

The original BUG_ON statement checks if the value of 'n' is equal to EXT_CSD_STR_LEN, which is likely a predefined constant representing the expected length of the string. If the condition is not met, the BUG_ON statement triggers a kernel panic, which is not an appropriate way to handle this situation.

The patch replaces the BUG_ON statement with an error handling code block. If the condition is not met, it sets the 'err' variable to -EINVAL (invalid argument) and jumps to the 'out_free' label to free resources before returning the error value to the caller.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue with improper error handling and replaces it with a more appropriate error return mechanism.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch only modifies the attribute index for temperature sensors in the ixgbe driver. While it aligns with the hwmon ABI specification, it does not fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "[media] v4l: Casting (void *) value returned by kmalloc is useless". This suggests that the patch is addressing a casting issue related to the kmalloc function in the Video4Linux (V4L) subsystem.

2. Patch Changes: The patch modifies the code in the vino_allocate_buffer function in the vino.c file. Specifically, it removes the unnecessary casting of the return value of kmalloc.

3. Analysis: The patch addresses a casting issue that does not have any functional impact on the code. Casting the return value of kmalloc to (unsigned long *) is unnecessary because kmalloc already returns a void pointer, which can be assigned directly to the fb->desc_table.virtual pointer.

4. Criteria for Acceptance: According to the criteria mentioned earlier, the patch should fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It should not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch does not fix a critical bug or address any of the mentioned issues. It only removes an unnecessary casting, which can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a single line of code. The change removes the "filter_relative" option from the "symbol_conf" structure in the "symbol.c" file.

Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the mos7720.c driver to use the module_usb_serial_driver() call instead of having a module_init/module_exit function. This change eliminates duplicated code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary braces in the code. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves an assignment statement out of an if () block. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the change does not introduce any new functionality or improve the performance of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: hyperv: Add processing of MTU reduced by the host
   - The patch aims to handle the case where the host reduces the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) due to headroom reservation for packet encapsulation.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch modifies the `nvsp_message` structure in `netvsc.c` to include the new MTU value.
   - It updates the `netvsc_change_mtu` function in `netvsc_drv.c` to set the limit for MTU based on the `NETVSC_MTU` value minus `ETH_HLEN`.
   - It adds code in `rndis_filter_device_add` function in `rndis_filter.c` to retrieve the MTU value from the host and assign it to `net_device->ndev->mtu`.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses the scenario where the host reduces the MTU due to encapsulation headroom reservation.
   - It ensures that the correct MTU value is used in the communication between the guest and the host.
   - The changes are specific to the Hyper-V network driver (`netvsc`) and the RNDIS filter driver (`rndis_filter`).

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real and critical issue related to MTU handling in the Hyper-V network driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of using the lookup table to set the baud rate only when the ioclk is 150MHz. It mentions that some boards might set ioclk to a different frequency.

2. The patch recalculates the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz.

3. The patch also includes changes to get the clk in the probe function and put it in remove.

4. The patch modifies the sirfsoc_uart_set_termios function by removing the assignment of ioclk_rate to 150000000.

5. The patch adds a condition to the fast calculation of the clk_div_reg based on the uartclk value being 150000000.

6. The patch sets the port's uartclk value to the rate obtained from the clk in the probe function.

7. The patch adds the clk variable to the sirfsoc_uart_port structure.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the baud rate calculation when the ioclk is not 150MHz. It introduces changes to handle different ioclk frequencies and ensures the correct calculation of clk_div_reg. The patch also includes necessary modifications to get and handle the clk in the probe and remove functions.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to the baud rate calculation and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `regulator_register` function in `drivers/regulator/core.c` and replaces the open-coded `_regulator_is_enabled` function call with the actual function call `_regulator_is_enabled(rdev)`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch also modifies the `regulator_suspend_finish` function in `drivers/regulator/core.c`. It replaces the condition `if (ops->is_enabled && !ops->is_enabled(rdev))` with `if (!_regulator_is_enabled(rdev))`. This change simplifies the code and makes it more concise.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code improvement patch that enhances readability and maintainability.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be converting the variable `num_drc_entries` from an unsigned int to an atomic_t type. This change allows for removing the spinlocking around the variable.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or code improvement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it exports the `confirm_error_lock` symbol so that it can be used in the PCI surprise hot remove path to freeze the affected PE. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. 

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a formatting issue in the perf trace code. The patch adds a closing parenthesis to the fprintf statement for exit_group() in the trace__sys_enter function.

Since this patch only addresses a formatting issue and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment in the cxgb4vf driver. Let's analyze it further to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the "do_gro" function in the "sge.c" file of the cxgb4vf driver. It adds an increment to the "vlan_ex" counter in the "rxq->stats" structure when "pkt->vlan_ex" is true. This counter keeps track of the number of VLAN packets processed.

Considering the criteria for acceptance, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue explicitly mentioned. However, it does fix a bug related to VLAN extraction counter increment, which could be considered a functional issue.

Since the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real bug, it could be considered for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the severity and impact of the bug should be evaluated further to make a final decision.

Therefore, my recommendation is to (A) accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), but further evaluation is needed to determine the severity and impact of the bug it fixes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: fix amdgpu_bo_unreserve order in GEM_OP IOCTL v2". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch adds amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in three different cases: when copying info to user space, when setting placement, and in the default case.

3. The patch also includes a fix for the default path, which was missing in the previous version of the patch.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the order of amdgpu_bo_unreserve calls in the GEM_OP IOCTL. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the changes made in the patch do not appear to be trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "NAK" (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) as it does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch splits the function `media_graph_walk_next()` into two functions: `media_graph_walk_next()` and `media_graph_walk_iter()`. This is done because `media_graph_walk_next()` is becoming more complicated, especially with the addition of `has_routing()` support.

2. The `media_graph_walk_iter()` function is introduced to handle the iteration logic within `media_graph_walk_next()`. It retrieves the current entity and link, checks if the link is enabled, checks if the entity has already been visited, and pushes the new entity to the stack.

3. The `media_graph_walk_next()` function now uses a while loop to iterate through the links until no more entities on the level can be found. Instead of containing the iteration logic, it calls the `media_graph_walk_iter()` function to perform the iteration.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a refactoring change that splits a complex function into two simpler functions. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable oprofile support on Lantiq targets for MIPS architecture. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue.

To make an informed decision, I would need more context about the bug or issue that this patch aims to resolve. Additionally, it would be helpful to review any discussions or feedback on the patch from the Linux kernel community.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an AUXDATA entry for the "nvidia,tegra30-ahub" device in the tegra30_auxdata_lookup array. This is necessary for clock lookups to work correctly for the Tegra30 I2S and AHUB modules.

Since this patch is adding necessary information for proper device identification and clock handling, it does not seem to be a trivial fix. However, without further context or information about the bug it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it fixes a real and critical issue.

Therefore, I would need more information to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the `finit_module` syscall in the SH architecture. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about the bug or issue it is intended to fix. 

Without additional context or details, it is difficult to determine the significance of this patch. Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. More information is needed to assess its impact and relevance.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves changing the return statement in the `rb532_gpio_get` function. The patch simply adds the `!!` operator to the existing return statement.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is a trivial fix that does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, I would classify it as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the twl6040 driver in the mfd subsystem. The patch checks the return value of the clk_prepare_enable() function and propagates the error in case of failure. This is important because clk_prepare_enable() can fail, and it is necessary to handle such failures properly.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues like build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring change rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch aims to remove duplicate code by having the ftrace arch_ftrace_update_code() use the generic ftrace_modify_all_code() function. Additionally, the default ftrace_replace_code() function is made weak so that an architecture can override it.

Since this patch does not address any real and critical bug, and it is not fixing any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the file `arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c` in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch adds a check for `sp->role.invalid` and `is_obsolete_sp()` in the `kvm_mmu_prepare_zap_page()` function before calling `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`.

3. The added check ensures that `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()` is only called if the page is not marked as invalid and is not obsolete.

4. The comment in the patch explains that obsolete pages cannot be used on any vCPUs.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of invalid and obsolete pages in the KVM MMU. While the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, it seems to be a targeted improvement to prevent unnecessary calls to `kvm_reload_remote_mmus()`.

However, without further information about the specific bug or issue this patch aims to fix, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. As an AI, I cannot make a definitive decision without more context.

To make an informed decision, it would be best to consult with the Linux kernel maintainers or the relevant community to understand the impact and significance of the bug being addressed by this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new helper function called `das16_isadma_disable()`. This function disables the ISA DMA controller and returns the residue as described in `Documentation/DMA-ISA-LPC.txt`. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to ISA DMA controller handling.

2. The patch modifies the `disable_dma_on_even()` function to use the new `das16_isadma_disable()` function instead of directly calling `disable_dma()` and `get_dma_residue()`. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch also removes the unnecessary `claim_dma_lock()`, `clear_dma_ff()`, and `release_dma_lock()` calls in the `das16_interrupt()` function. This simplifies the code and removes unnecessary operations.

4. The `das16_alloc_dma()` function now uses `das16_isadma_disable()` instead of `disable_dma()` and `release_dma_lock()`. This change improves consistency and readability.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to ISA DMA controller handling and improves code readability and maintainability. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a function called `add_temp_sensors` which is used to detect and report additional temperature sources for fan control.

2. The `add_temp_sensors` function iterates over the temperature sources and checks if there are additional monitoring registers available.

3. If additional monitoring registers are available and not already being used, the function enables monitoring for the temperature source and updates the available and mask variables accordingly.

4. In the `nct6775_probe` function, after initializing the mask variable, the patch calls `add_temp_sensors` twice, once for `data->REG_TEMP_SEL` and once for `data->REG_WEIGHT_TEMP_SEL`, to enable monitoring for any unmonitored temperature registers.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds functionality to detect and enable monitoring for additional temperature sources. This can be considered as an enhancement rather than a fix for a critical bug or issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential issue related to USB endpoint types in the dwc3 gadget driver. The patch replaces a BUG() statement with a dev_WARN() statement, which warns about an unknown endpoint type instead of causing a system crash.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue but does not fall into the category of a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on replacing the BUG() statement with a dev_WARN() statement.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch description states that it fixes a vendor command interface issue. This suggests that it addresses a specific problem rather than a trivial fix.

2. The patch includes reviewed-by and signed-off-by tags from multiple individuals, including developers from Broadcom. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and testing by experts in the field.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the brcmf_cfg80211_vndr_cmds_dcmd_handler function. It introduces changes to use the caller-supplied interface instead of the main interface. This change is intended to improve the handling of vendor-specific commands.

4. The code changes appear to be focused on addressing a specific issue related to the handling of vendor commands. It does not involve trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses a real and specific issue related to the brcmfmac driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid improvement to the serial-uartlite driver. The patch modifies the `ulite_isr` function by moving the spinlock acquisition and release inside the loop, reducing the time the spinlock is held.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be an optimization to reduce the time the spinlock is held, which can improve performance but does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: mxs: correct 'direction' of device_prep_dma_cyclic". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to the 'direction' parameter in the device_prep_dma_cyclic function in the ASoC mxs driver.

2. The commit message mentions that commit 49920bc changed the type of the 'direction' parameter from dma_data_direction to dma_transfer_direction.

3. Looking at the code changes, we see that the patch modifies the 'direction' parameter in the snd_mxs_pcm_hw_params function. It changes the value passed to the function from DMA_TO_DEVICE to DMA_MEM_TO_DEV for the SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK stream, and from DMA_FROM_DEVICE to DMA_DEV_TO_MEM for other streams.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is correcting the 'direction' parameter in the device_prep_dma_cyclic function to use the appropriate values based on the stream type. This fix does not seem to address a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, the change does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it suggests printing a message to let the user know they could try using "pci=realloc" if some PCI device resources are unassigned. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a suggestion for the user to try a boot option.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds missing static storage class specifiers in the udl_connector.c file. The patch addresses sparse warnings related to undeclared symbols and suggests making them static.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, and only addresses sparse warnings, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that replaces the usage of 0 and 1 with the true and false defines for boolean variables. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves spelling changes and whitespace cleanups. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with the alternatives patching on secondary CPUs in the arm64 architecture. The patch adds an "isb" instruction after the secondary polling loop to ensure that the patched instruction stream is visible to the CPU.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

From the patch description, it seems that the issue addressed is related to ensuring the visibility of the patched instruction stream, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior if not handled correctly. While it may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption, it can be considered a critical bug as it affects the correctness of the code execution.

Regarding the trivial fixes, the patch does not appear to contain any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications. It specifically adds the necessary "isb" instruction to address the issue.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial modifications.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the QM (Queue Manager) initialization logic in the qed driver for QLogic Ethernet devices. The bug is related to not passing the number of tasks to the QM init logic, which can cause back-pressure and reduced performance in scenarios requiring many tasks.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can impact performance. It is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue described in the patch causes a failure in adding a route when a nonsensical route is added and the destination address is still undergoing Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

2. The bug can lead to unexpected behavior: The route lookup may select the wrong outgoing interface due to the prefix route that is added before DAD work is completed. This can result in incorrect routing and potential network connectivity issues.

3. The patch introduces a test to check if the nexthop gateway is a local address: By explicitly checking if the gateway address is a local address, the patch ensures that the route lookup correctly handles the scenario where the address is still undergoing DAD.

4. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by other developers: The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Hannes Frederic Sowa, indicating that it has undergone peer review and is considered appropriate.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a critical bug and introduces a necessary check to prevent incorrect routing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a copy/paste error in the code. The change only modifies a single line by correcting the link activation from "B" to "A". Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error on the arm64 architecture. Build errors can prevent the kernel from being compiled correctly, so fixing them is important for maintaining a stable release.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a build error, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that initializes the boolean variable 'found' to false. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (initializing a variable), I would classify this patch as a NAK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a compiler warning related to a debug print statement in the iommu_map() function of the iommu.c file. The change modifies the format specifier for the "pgsize" variable to cast it as an unsigned long.

Since this patch only addresses a compiler warning and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug introduced by commit c5b367835cfc, which changed the build_pte_present() and build_pte_writable() functions to assume a constant offset of _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE relative to _PAGE_PRESENT. However, this assumption is no longer true for some MIPS32R2 builds due to commit be0c37c985ed, which rearranged the PTE bits.

2. The patch makes use of the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask to apply instead of hard coding the values 3 and 5.

3. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the bug, providing a clear indication of the problem being addressed.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause build errors or other issues on certain MIPS32R2 builds. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `gb_tty_probe` function by changing the line `greybus_set_drvdata(gdev, gb_tty);` to `gdev->gb_tty = gb_tty;`. This change ties the `gb_tty` structure into the `gb_core` properly.

2. The patch also modifies the `gb_tty_disconnect` function by changing the line `struct gb_tty *gb_tty = greybus_get_drvdata(gdev);` to `struct gb_tty *gb_tty = gdev->gb_tty;`. This change retrieves the `gb_tty` structure from `gdev` properly.

Based on the provided patch, it seems to fix a bug related to tying the `gb_tty` structure into the `gb_core` properly and retrieving it correctly during disconnection. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, its impact, and whether it falls under the categories of critical bugs causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, real security issues, or other significant issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the LRW cipher implementation in the Linux kernel. The patch defines a constant `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` with a value of 16, which represents the fixed block size of the LRW cipher. This constant is then used in place of the `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` function calls throughout the code.

Since this patch does not involve any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue related to the LRW cipher, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming an argument from "virq" to "irq" in the function `mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map()`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or naming convention change.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the Wacom HID driver. The patch aims to extend the recognition of certain fields by the WACOM_PEN_FIELD and WACOM_FINGER_FIELD macros. It introduces new usages (WACOM_G9_PEN, WACOM_G9_TOUCHSCREEN, WACOM_HID_G11_PEN, and WACOM_HID_G11_TOUCHSCREEN) that should be checked by the macros.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an enhancement or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `clone_mnt` function in the `fs/namespace.c` file.

2. The patch introduces a condition to set the `MNT_LOCKED` flag on the new mount (`mnt`) if the `CL_UNPRIVILEGED` flag is set and either the `CL_EXPIRE` flag is not set or the `old` mount's `mnt_expire` list is empty.

3. The `MNT_LOCKED` flag is used to prevent unprivileged users from revealing what is under a mount.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a security issue by ensuring that unprivileged users cannot reveal information under a mount. It also takes into account the `CL_EXPIRE` flag and the `mnt_expire` list.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a quirk for the ASUS X75VD laptop to fix Wi-Fi functionality. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a Wi-Fi issue on the ASUS X75VD laptop, which can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? 
   No, the patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? 
   No, the patch does not include any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a prefix to the print format in the asymmetric key signature handling. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that addresses warnings reported by the compiler. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that marks a function as static to address a warning during the build process. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (whitespace cleanup), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce two new knobs, `idgen_retries` and `idgen_delay`, to the IPv6 subsystem. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. 

The patch modifies the `struct netns_sysctl_ipv6` in `include/net/netns/ipv6.h` to include the new knobs `idgen_retries` and `idgen_delay`. It also modifies the `struct netns_ipv6` in the same file to include the corresponding fields.

In `net/ipv6/addrconf.c`, the patch modifies the `addrconf_dad_failure` function to use the `idgen_retries` and `idgen_delay` values from the `net` structure instead of using hardcoded values. Similarly, in `ipv6_generate_stable_address` function in `net/ipv6/addrconf.c`, the patch replaces the hardcoded `idgen_retries` value with the one from the `net` structure.

In `net/ipv6/af_inet6.c`, the patch initializes the `idgen_retries` and `idgen_delay` fields in the `net` structure to their default values.

In `net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c`, the patch adds the `idgen_retries` and `idgen_delay` knobs to the `ipv6_table_template` and initializes them with the values from the `net` structure.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It introduces new knobs specified by RFC 7217, which can be considered as an enhancement rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h`. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to auto-mute or auto-mic functionality for retasked jacks in the ALSA HDA driver. 

The patch checks if a jack has been retasked as a different direction (e.g., a mic jack used as a CLFE output) and ensures that the automatic jack switching does not occur for such retasked jacks. It achieves this by skipping the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl direction is different from what is expected.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a specific behavior related to retasked jacks, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue but not critical.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its impact and relevance.

The patch addresses a build error caused by an implicit declaration of the `cmpxchg64` function in the `bcon_advance_console_bytes` function of `drivers/block/blockconsole.c`. The error occurs when the `CONFIG_RMW_INSNS` configuration option is enabled.

The patch proposes to map `cmpxchg64` to `cmpxchg64_local`, which is already mapped to `__cmpxchg64_local_generic`, similar to the case when `CONFIG_RMW_INSNS` is disabled.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a build error, which is a real and critical bug. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering this analysis, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to calculating the location of query 8 in the HID RMI driver. The patch addresses the issue of the touchpad not reporting relative data, which causes the absence of query 6 and requires the calculation of the location of query 8 instead of hardcoding the offset.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific functionality issue related to touchpad reporting. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch moves the "apply_feature_fixups()" function call from the "setup_system()" function to the "early_setup()" function in the "setup_64.c" file.

Since this patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the way the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is reported in the zl10353 driver for DVB frontends. The patch changes the calculation of the SNR value from a raw hardware register value to a 0.1 dB scale.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Renesas IRQC interrupt controller driver. The changes include adding more register documentation and defining register addresses.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds documentation and register definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a "line over 80" issue, which is related to code formatting and does not fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. The error is caused by the 'rspi_of_match' variable being undeclared in the 'rspi_probe' function of the spi-rspi.c file.

Since this patch addresses a build error, it does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. Additionally, it seems to be a trivial fix that does not introduce any new functionality or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi driver. The patch modifies the if condition that checks the value of the "mode" variable.

The original if condition checks if the sscanf function successfully reads an integer from the "buf" string and if the "mode" variable is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the modified if condition uses logical OR (||) instead of logical AND (&&) between the two sub-conditions. This change could potentially introduce a bug.

The modified if condition checks if the sscanf function fails to read an integer from the "buf" string or if the "mode" variable is not equal to 2 or 1. This means that if the sscanf function fails, the condition will always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of "mode". This could lead to incorrect behavior and potentially allow invalid values for "mode" to be accepted.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it introduces a potential bug. The original if condition seems to be correct, and modifying it in this way could have unintended consequences.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a hardcoded value with a macro. The change is not related to fixing a real and critical bug, causing a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for the wil6210 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds debug prints for vring deallocation in the `wil_vring_free` function.

Since this patch is only adding debug prints and does not fix any real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that moves some variables from one file to another. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains some trivial changes such as spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch replaces `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to avoid common clk framework warnings. This change seems to be a non-trivial fix.

2. In the `atmel_usba_start` function, the patch modifies the code to use `clk_prepare_enable` instead of `clk_enable` for `udc->pclk` and `udc->hclk`. It also adds error handling in case `clk_prepare_enable` fails. This change ensures that the clock is properly prepared before enabling it.

3. In the `atmel_usba_stop` function, the patch replaces `clk_disable` with `clk_disable_unprepare` for `udc->hclk` and `udc->pclk`. This change ensures that the clock is properly disabled and unprepared.

4. In the `usba_udc_probe` function, the patch modifies the code to use `clk_prepare_enable` instead of `clk_enable` for `pclk`. It also adds error handling in case `clk_prepare_enable` fails. This change ensures that the clock is properly prepared before enabling it.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a potential issue with clock handling in the `atmel_usba` gadget driver. It replaces the usage of `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` to ensure proper clock preparation and handling. This change seems to address a potential bug and is not a trivial fix.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the __func__ argument from the dev_err function calls in the gdm_sdio.c file. This change removes the specific instance of the device from the log printout.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for setting correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions in the x86/PCI code. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases:

1. The patch moves the final fixups from __init to __devinit. This change suggests that the final fixups should not be executed during the initialization phase but rather during device enumeration.

2. The comment in the code mentions that if hotplug is supported, the final fixups may occur after boot. This implies that the fixups cannot be marked as __init, which is only executed during the initialization phase.

3. The function `quirk_amd_nb_node` is modified to use the `__devinit` attribute instead of `__init`. This attribute indicates that the function is only used during device initialization and will not be used after that.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to setting correct numa_node information for AMD NB functions. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, and it is related to device enumeration and initialization. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the Acer Aspire 5741 model. The patch adds the model to the quirk table in the acer-wmi driver to address the broken ACPI video backlight control.

Since this patch addresses a specific hardware issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that allows the inclusion of ".GCC.command.line" sections in modules to prevent modpost warnings. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error checking for DMA mapping in the advansys driver, specifically in the function `advansys_get_sense_buffer_dma()`. This is important because DMA mapping can fail, and it's necessary to handle such errors.

2. The patch checks for a DMA mapping error using the `dma_mapping_error()` function. If an error occurs, it logs a debug message and returns 0, indicating a failure to map the sense buffer.

3. In the `asc_build_req()` function, the patch checks if the sense buffer mapping failed and returns `ASC_BUSY` if it did. This ensures that the request is not built if the sense buffer mapping failed.

4. Similarly, in the same function, the patch checks for a failure to map the scatter-gather list (`use_sg < 0`) and returns `ASC_BUSY` if it failed. This prevents building the request if the scatter-gather list mapping failed.

5. In the `adv_build_req()` function, the patch adds the same error checking for the sense buffer mapping and the scatter-gather list mapping.

6. In the `asc_execute_scsi_cmnd()` function, the patch handles the return value of `asc_build_req()` correctly. If it returns an error other than `ASC_NOERROR`, it logs a build error and returns the error code.

Overall, the patch addresses potential DMA mapping errors and handles them appropriately. It ensures that the sense buffer and scatter-gather list mappings are successful before proceeding with request building. Therefore, it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to object size calculation in the i915 graphics driver. The patch adds a warning and checks for potential overflows when creating an object with a size larger than a certain limit.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue that may not have immediate consequences.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a debug level for channel context in the ath9k driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any significant functionality or improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a deprecated function with a recommended alternative. The deprecated function `create_singlethread_workqueue()` is replaced with `alloc_ordered_workqueue()`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for setting the `all_device_types` field when restoring the persistent state in the `pulse8-cec` driver. 

This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be addressing a missing initialization issue, which can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for proper error handling in the `init_dma_pools()` function in the `amd5536udc` driver. The patch addresses the issue of not properly handling the failure to allocate memory for the `data_requests` and `stp_requests` pools.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be more of a code improvement rather than fixing a significant issue.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. However, it is important to note that the patch does not meet the criteria for a critical bug fix.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return values of tiocmget and tiocmset functions in the ftdi_sio driver. The patch includes changes to handle USB-internal error codes and translate them to appropriate return values for userspace.

Since this patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves performance by using the `ipv6_addr_any()` helper function instead of `ipv6_addr_type()` to determine if an address is an IPv6 any address. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix related to code formatting. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary NULL checks before calling the release_firmware() function. Since the release_firmware() function can handle NULL pointers gracefully, the explicit tests before the call are deemed pointless.

Considering that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, it can be categorized as a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes an unnecessary line break in the show_scaling_cur_freq() function in the cpufreq.c file. Since this change does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing whitespace), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "static" keyword to the "DEFINE_STATIC_KEY_FALSE" macro. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The changes involve converting the wm8776 codec driver to use table-based control and DAPM initialization.

Since the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it does not contain any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the GPIO controller in the Nomadik platform. It introduces two new registers, `rimsc` and `fimsc`, and caches them in the `struct nmk_gpio_chip`. The patch also modifies the `__nmk_gpio_set_mode_safe` and `__nmk_gpio_irq_modify` functions to use the cached values instead of reading them from the hardware.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Instead, it appears to be a performance optimization by caching the register values.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and contains a "trivial" fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem in the Linux kernel. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. 

Instead, this patch seems to be adding functionality to parse out the ECC (Error Correction Code) information for full-id NAND chips. While this may be a useful enhancement, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address any critical issues.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes some local functions and replaces them with existing helper functions. The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unused parameter `*pPacket` from the function `s_cbFillTxBufHead()`. The patch replaces the usage of `pPacket` with `skb->data` directly. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a trivial change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only adds the "const" qualifier to the "ab8500_cell" structure in the "db8500_prcmu_register_ab8500" function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple code cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch implements the start_streaming and stop_streaming operations for the vb2 queue in the uvcvideo driver. While this change may improve the functionality of the driver, it does not address any real and critical bugs or issues.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves readability and does not introduce any functional changes. It changes the return type of the function `is_file_hugepages()` from `int` to `bool` and simplifies the implementation by removing an unnecessary if condition.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (changing return type and removing an if condition), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the "frontend" extra MSR on Skylake in the JSON conversion. 

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a POSTING_READ macro call to keep the cached values in sync with the hardware. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding an interface to get the DMA frame and instruction buffer (IB) size for the amdgpu ring. This can be useful for properly calculating space on the ring for IB submissions.

However, without further context or information about any real and critical bug that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, I cannot make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "__always_unused" attribute to the "filter_mask" parameter in the "i40e_ndo_bridge_getlink" function. This attribute is used to indicate that the parameter is intentionally unused and should not trigger any warnings or errors during compilation.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (adding an attribute), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an acknowledgment of the TX control register in the nps_enet_tx_handler function. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an endian bug in the cpufreq_get_max_state() function in the drivers/thermal/cpu_cooling.c file. The bug causes incorrect storage of low values in the high bits of an unsigned long variable, resulting in a very high value instead.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption. It is not a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup patch that removes a global variable and moves it into a function. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not. The patch appears to add soft reset controller support for STiH415 and includes new softreset lines required for other device tree nodes. However, without further information about the specific bug or issue that this patch addresses, it is not possible to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, additional details about the bug or issue being fixed by this patch would be necessary.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of the hash function in the sch_fq.c file.
2. The patch replaces the existing hash_32() function with hash_ptr() for 64-bit architectures.
3. The reason for this change is that the author, Eric Dumazet, initially chose hash_32() due to performance issues with hash_ptr() on 64-bit architectures.
4. However, Linus Torvalds and George Spelvin have fixed the performance issues with hash_ptr(), making it a better choice for 64-bit architectures with large amounts of memory.
5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and also includes Cc to Hugh Dickins.
6. The patch modifies the fq_classify() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the fq_root array.
7. The patch also modifies the fq_rehash() function by replacing the hash_32() call with hash_ptr() when accessing the new_array.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is addressing a performance issue and improving the hash function usage on 64-bit architectures with large memory sizes. It does not fix a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a performance improvement rather than a critical bug fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: arche-apb: Don't use gpio after failing to request it" and is signed-off by Viresh Kumar and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

2. The patch modifies the function `apb_ctrl_init_seq` in the file `arche-apb-ctrl.c` under the `drivers/staging/greybus` directory.

3. In the `apb_ctrl_init_seq` function, there is a check for the validity of the `apb->clk_en_gpio` GPIO.

4. If the GPIO is valid, the patch attempts to request the GPIO using `devm_gpio_request`. If the request fails (returns an error), a warning message is printed.

5. Prior to the patch, regardless of the request result, the code proceeds to set the direction of the GPIO using `gpio_direction_output`.

6. With the patch applied, if the GPIO request fails, the code skips setting the direction of the GPIO.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch fixes a potential issue where the direction of a GPIO is set even after a failed request, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. This fix addresses a potential bug that could cause issues and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `fuse_file_fallocate()` function in the `fs/fuse/file.c` file.

2. The change replaces the line `struct inode *inode = file->f_inode;` with `struct inode *inode = file_inode(file);`.

3. The `file_inode()` function is used to obtain the `inode` pointer from the `file` structure. This function is a helper function defined in the kernel and is used to improve code readability.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is a trivial fix that replaces a direct access to `file->f_inode` with the `file_inode()` helper function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it is a whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves constifying the struct regmap_config and regulator_ops in the tps65023-regulator.c driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix involving spelling changes and whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ath9k: Check beaconing mode properly"
   - The patch aims to address an issue related to beaconing mode in the ath9k wireless driver.

2. Patch Description:
   - In MCC (Multiple Concurrent Channels) mode, the Time Synchronization Function (TSF) of a context needs to be adjusted only if it is a Group Owner/Access Point (GO/AP).
   - The patch adds a check to verify if the previous channel switch was scheduled after a beacon transmission. If not, it returns without adjusting the TSF.

3. Signed-off-by:
   - The patch is signed-off by Sujith Manoharan <c_manoha@qca.qualcomm.com> and John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>.
   - The patch is related to the file "drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/channel.c".

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to beaconing mode in the ath9k driver. It introduces a check to ensure that the TSF adjustment is only performed when necessary. 

Since this patch fixes a specific issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid bug fix related to the ARM OMAP platform. The patch switches from using the deprecated `setup_sched_clock` function to the newer `sched_clock_register` function. This change allows for the use of the 64-bit `omap_32k_read_sched_clock` function instead of the previous 32-bit version.

Since this patch fixes a potential issue with the sched_clock interface and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed functions that automatically handle resource cleanup. This helps reduce code size and simplifies the code.

The changes made in the patch are not trivial, as they involve replacing the kzalloc() function with devm_kzalloc() and handling the error conditions appropriately.

The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical bugs. However, it improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of resource leaks.

Therefore, considering that the patch meets the criteria of not containing trivial fixes and improving code quality, it can be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary function call. The patch removes the second call to the function `i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div()` in the `do_cmd` function of the `adl_pci9111` driver. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant code. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a lockdep_assert_held() call in the fence_signal_locked() function of the dma-buf/fence.c file. This lockdep_assert_held() call is used to verify that the lock associated with the fence object is held when the function is called.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming the camellia module to camellia_generic. This change allows optimized assembler implementations to autoload with module-alias.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch modifies the default RSS (Receive Side Scaling) behavior in the mlx5e driver to distribute the default RSS table uniformly over the rings of the close NUMA node, instead of all available channels.

While this change may improve performance or optimize resource allocation, it does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves converting the use of typedef ctl_table to struct ctl_table. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it seems to fall under the category of a "trivial" fix as it involves removing an unnecessary typedef.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding new definitions for ATPX in the AMDGPU driver. These definitions include ATPX_DGPU_CAN_DRIVE_DISPLAYS and ATPX_MS_HYBRID_GFX_SUPPORTED.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it only adds new definitions, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `check_flush_dependency` which checks for flush dependency sanity.
2. The `check_flush_dependency` function is called in two places: in the `flush_workqueue` function and in the `start_flush_work` function.
3. The purpose of the `check_flush_dependency` function is to verify that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items.
4. If the target workqueue does not have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set, the function triggers a warning using `WARN_ONCE`.
5. The warning message includes information about the current task or work item, the target workqueue name, and the target function.
6. The patch also adds a call to `check_flush_dependency` in the `flush_workqueue` function before unlocking the workqueue mutex.
7. Additionally, the patch adds a call to `check_flush_dependency` in the `start_flush_work` function before inserting the work item into the workqueue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue where memory reclaim tries to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or its work items, which can lead to a deadlock. The patch adds a warning to detect such conditions and prevent the deadlock.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential deadlock issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that sets the FPU type for ColdFire MMU platforms. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the incorrect use of `sizeof` in the `rtsx_probe()` function in the `rts5208` staging driver. The patch changes the allocation size of `dev->chip` from `sizeof(dev->chip)` to `sizeof(*dev->chip)`, which correctly allocates memory for the pointed data rather than the size of the pointer itself.

Since this patch fixes a potential bug that could lead to incorrect memory allocation, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `handle_IRQ` with `handle_domain_irq` in the `sa1100_handle_irq` function. This change is aimed at automatically mapping the hardware IRQ number to a virtual IRQ.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific bug related to the Intel D525MW mainboard. The bug is reported to cause a phantom LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) header to be detected on the mainboard, even though it only has a VGA-out.

The patch adds a new entry to the `intel_no_lvds` array in the `intel_lvds.c` file. This entry specifies a DMI (Desktop Management Interface) system ID callback function and identifies the Intel D525MW mainboard. The purpose of this entry is to quirk away the phantom LVDS header on this specific mainboard.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a specific bug, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. It fixes an issue that could potentially cause confusion or misconfiguration due to the incorrect detection of a non-existent LVDS header.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that makes the debugging output of the turbostat tool less verbose. The patch modifies the `dump_cnt` function to only print the counters that are active, rather than printing all counters regardless of their value.

While this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, it does improve the usability and readability of the tool by reducing unnecessary output. However, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only affects the verbosity of the debugging output.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to firmware UCODE_ID_STORAGE in the virtualization environment for Tonga. The patch allocates a BO (buffer object) and provides the BO's mc address to the hardware to prevent a hang on VFs (virtual functions).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug related to firmware UCODE_ID_STORAGE, which can cause a hang in the virtualization environment. This qualifies as a real and critical bug.

2. The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the ftgmac100 hardware revision in the Aspeed AST2500. The patch separates the rx page storage from rxdesc by introducing a new member `rx_pages` in the `struct ftgmac100` and modifies the functions `ftgmac100_rxdes_set_page`, `ftgmac100_rxdes_get_page`, `ftgmac100_rx_packet`, `ftgmac100_alloc_rx_page`, and `ftgmac100_free_buffers` to use this new member.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue, but it appears to address a potential corruption issue caused by the ftgmac100 hardware revision. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug. However, assuming the bug is real and critical, we can proceed with the analysis.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch aims to prevent corruption by separating the rx page storage from rxdesc. It does not introduce any obvious build errors, oops, hangs, or security issues. It addresses a potential data corruption issue, which can be considered a critical issue.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes. It introduces a significant change by adding a new member and modifying multiple functions.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to potential data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK) in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves removing the use of the return value of seq_printf and converting it to check seq_has_overflowed instead. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to debug logs in the Bluetooth subsystem. The issue is that the expected and actual key count values were mixed up in the debug logs. The patch corrects this by swapping the values in the log messages.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially cause confusion or misinterpretation of debug logs, it can be considered a valid fix. However, it does not seem to fix a critical issue that causes a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the fix does not involve any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical fix and recommend it for inclusion in Linux -stable releases with a NAK.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to improve the logic for de-emphasis sampling rate selection in the tas5086 codec driver.

2. Code Changes: The code changes are as follows:
   - Previously, the code checked if the deemphasis flag was set and then iterated through an array of deemphasis values to find a match with the current rate.
   - The patch introduces a break statement to exit the loop once a match is found, improving the efficiency of the logic.

3. Impact Analysis: Based on the code changes, it appears that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it improves the efficiency of the de-emphasis sampling rate selection logic.

4. Triviality Check: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it does not fix a critical bug or address a real and significant issue. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a configuration option related to DMA in the addi-data drivers. The patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `comedi_driver_unregister()` function in the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers.c` file.

2. The change replaces the call to `comedi_dev_from_minor()` with `comedi_dev_get_from_minor()` when finding devices using the driver.

3. The purpose of this change is to increment the reference count of the device to prevent it from being removed while it is being checked to see if it is attached to the driver.

4. After the check is performed, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue related to device removal while being checked for attachment to the driver. This could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could cause data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a generic compatible string for the hix5hd2 gmac controller. It does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters in the cxgb4 driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial change that adds device IDs to the existing list.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the onyx and tas codec drivers to use the `module_i2c_driver()` macro. This change makes the code smaller and simpler, but it does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function call, `xgpu_ai_mailbox_set_irq_funcs(adev)`, in the `soc15_common_early_init` function. This function is only called if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This indicates that the patch is adding functionality related to the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) mailbox for soc15 asics.

2. The patch also adds a new function, `soc15_common_late_init`, which is called during late initialization if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This function calls `xgpu_ai_mailbox_get_irq(adev)`.

3. Another new function, `soc15_common_sw_init`, is added, which is called during software initialization if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This function calls `xgpu_ai_mailbox_add_irq_id(adev)`.

4. The `soc15_common_hw_fini` function is modified to include a call to `xgpu_ai_mailbox_put_irq(adev)` if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This call is made during hardware finalization.

5. The `soc15_common_ip_funcs` structure is modified to include the `soc15_common_late_init` function in the `late_init` field.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds functionality related to the SR-IOV mailbox for soc15 asics. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a security issue.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unused #defines. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch reorders the fields in the `struct i915_params` in the `i915_drv.h` file.
   - Reordering fields does not fix any real or critical bug, so this change is not related to any of the criteria mentioned.
   - This change does not introduce any new functionality or fix any issue, but it is a code organization change.

2. The patch removes the `enable_hangcheck` field from the `struct i915_params`.
   - Removing this field may indicate that the hangcheck functionality is no longer needed or has been replaced by another mechanism.
   - Without further context, it is difficult to determine the impact of removing this field.

3. The patch adds the `fastboot` field to the `struct i915_params`.
   - Adding this field may introduce a new feature or functionality related to fast booting.
   - Without further context, it is difficult to determine the impact of adding this field.

4. The patch adds the `invert_brightness` field to the `struct i915_params`.
   - Adding this field may indicate a new feature or functionality related to inverting brightness.
   - Without further context, it is difficult to determine the impact of adding this field.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch does not fix any real or critical bug, and it introduces changes that are not directly related to the mentioned criteria. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing an error path in the mcb_pci_probe() function where it incorrectly returns zero instead of an error code. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a missing register setting in the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver for the Renesas R-Car Gen2 platform. The patch adds the missing OUT register setting for SRC_O_BUSIF_MODE.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that adds a missing register setting, which does not fall under the accepted criteria.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the IS_ERR_OR_NULL() macro instead of explicitly checking for NULL and IS_ERR(). This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op, ensuring that all the callers put the open stateid after use. This step is necessary for the removal of client_mutex.

2. The patch includes a FIXME comment suggesting that the atomic_inc operation should be moved into nfs4_preprocess_seqid_op. This indicates that there might be room for improvement or further refinement in the code.

3. The patch modifies the nfsd4_open_downgrade function by adding a goto statement to the put_stateid label when certain conditions are met. This change ensures that the stateid is properly released before exiting the function.

4. The patch also modifies the nfsd4_lock function by introducing a new local variable open_stp and adding a call to nfs4_put_stid for open_stp when necessary. This change ensures that the open stateid is properly released.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses some issues related to reference counting and proper stateid handling. However, it does not fix any critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a whitespace cleanup and symbol staticization patch for the `drivers/crypto/dcp.c` file in the Linux kernel. It makes the `global_dev` symbol static and also staticizes the `dcp_dma_unmap`, `dcp_dma_map`, and `dcp_watchdog` functions.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It is a trivial fix that only involves symbol staticization and whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a local variable 'status' and simplifies the code by removing an unnecessary check. Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves a minor code cleanup, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that adds the 'const' qualifier to the 'data' parameter in the 'fsnotify' function and related function declarations. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value of `clk_round_rate()` from a negative error code to 0. This change is made because `clk_round_rate()` is being modified to return an unsigned type to support clock sources with rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects some kerneldoc typos and adjusts the function declaration for consistency. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it contains spelling changes and whitespace cleanups, which are considered trivial fixes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces open-coded spi_sync() with spi_sync_transfer(). The patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is simply a code cleanup to make the code shorter.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes a variable name from "mute_led_nid" to "cap_mute_led_nid". This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to introduce any new functionality or improve the code in any significant way.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that turns off the voltage for thermistors when the ADC conversion is initiated. This change is aimed at saving power. 

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any significant changes or improvements.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the iio pressure mpl3115 driver. The patch ensures that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads by using claim/release helper functions. It also handles error cases appropriately.

However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if the bug is critical or if it causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, etc.). Additionally, it is not clear if the fix is non-trivial or if it contains any trivial changes.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed and the impact it has on the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a cleanup of error codes in the hv.c file in the staging directory. The patch changes the return values from -1 to specific error codes, such as -EMSGSIZE and -ENOMEM.

Since this patch is only a cleanup of error codes and does not fix any real and critical bugs, it would be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue of dropped characters at close in the sierra USB serial driver. The patch adds the implementation of the `sierra_chars_in_buffer` function, which calculates the number of characters in the buffer by multiplying the number of outstanding URBS (USB Request Blocks) with the maximum transfer size.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a potential issue of dropped characters, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the visibility of a structure declaration. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

2. It introduces a new macro `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the number of intervals.

3. The `INTERVALS` macro is modified to use the `INTERVAL_SHIFT` macro instead of a hardcoded value.

4. In the `get_typical_interval` function, the calculation of the average is modified. If the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`, a right shift is performed on the average instead of using `do_div`. Otherwise, the `do_div` function is used as before.

5. Similarly, the calculation of the standard deviation is modified to use a right shift if the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`.

Based on this analysis, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be an optimization to improve the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the uprobes/x86 code. The patch ensures that if the ->pre_xol() hook fails, the task's state is not changed and the error is returned to allow for a restart.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a code improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the 'ai_continuous' member from the private data structure in the usbduxfast driver. Instead, it suggests determining the value of 'ai_continuous' from the cmd->stop_src member.

The rationale behind this change seems to be that the value of 'ai_continuous' can be inferred from the cmd->stop_src member, eliminating the need for a separate variable.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or optimization change.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the libcfs_ioctl() prototype in the staging/lustre code. The patch changes the second argument of the libcfs_ioctl() function from "void *arg" to "void __user *arg". 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - The patch appears to fix a prototype mismatch in the libcfs_ioctl() function, which can potentially lead to issues if the incorrect type is used. While it may not directly cause a build error, oops, hang, or data corruption, it can still be considered a bug.

2. Does it address a security issue or an "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not seem to address a security issue explicitly. However, if the incorrect type is used in the libcfs_ioctl() function, it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). While it may not directly fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, or data corruption, it addresses a prototype mismatch that can lead to issues and potentially impact security.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces no functional changes or fixes any real and critical bugs. The patch only modifies the usage of a local variable in the `_regulator_do_set_voltage()` function. Since it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds support for the "wakeup-source" property in addition to the existing "has-tpo" property in the opal rtc driver. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the powergating logic in the AMDGPU driver for the CI (Caribbean Islands) GPU family. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch is titled "drm/amdgpu: refine ci uvd dpm code." It suggests that it refines the power management code for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block on CI GPUs.

2. The patch includes a "Signed-off-by" line from Rex Zhu and an "Ack-by" line from Tom St Denis. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. The patch also includes a "Reviewed-by" line from Alex Deucher, which further indicates that the patch has been reviewed by another developer.

4. The patch modifies the `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` function in the `ci_dpm.c` file.

5. In the modified function, there is a conditional statement that checks whether the `gate` parameter is true or false.

6. If `gate` is true, the UVD block is stopped by calling `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` with the `AMD_PG_STATE_GATE` state. Then, `ci_update_uvd_dpm` is called with `gate` as the argument.

7. If `gate` is false, the UVD block is un-gated by calling `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` with the `AMD_PG_STATE_UNGATE` state. Then, `ci_update_uvd_dpm` is called with `gate` as the argument.

8. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to powergating the UVD block on CI GPUs. It modifies the powergating logic to properly stop or un-gate the UVD block based on the `gate` parameter. Since this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to power management and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a function in the rtl8192e driver. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the function `add_pcie_port` to `dra7xx_add_pcie_port` in the `pci-dra7xx.c` file. This change is specific to the `dra7xx` platform and is aimed at avoiding collisions in the global namespace.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue, and it only involves a trivial renaming, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a function `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drm/radeon/dpm` directory. This function allows forcing a performance level via sysfs.

2. The function takes two parameters: `rdev`, which is a pointer to the `radeon_device` structure, and `level`, which is an enum representing the forced performance level.

3. Inside the function, it retrieves the current power state and performance state of the device.

4. Depending on the `level` parameter, the function sends messages to the SMC (System Management Controller) to set the enabled and forced performance levels accordingly.

5. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_HIGH`, it sets the enabled levels to 0 and the forced levels to 1.

6. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_LOW`, it sets the forced levels to 0 and the enabled levels to the maximum performance level count minus 1.

7. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_AUTO`, it sets both the forced and enabled levels to 0.

8. Finally, it updates the `forced_level` field in the `radeon_device` structure and returns 0 if the SMC messages were sent successfully.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary functionality to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drm/radeon/dpm` directory. It allows forcing a specific performance level via sysfs, which can be useful for debugging or specific use cases. Since it addresses a real and critical issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for encoding the `flags` field in the `ceph_osd_op` structure. However, without further context or information about the bug it is intended to fix, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the bug being addressed, such as whether it causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue. Additionally, I would need to confirm that the fix does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Please provide more information about the bug and any relevant details, so I can make an accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the MXS MMC device on the mach-tx28 platform. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. 

In this case, the patch does not seem to fix a bug or address any critical issue. It is adding support for a new device, which is not considered a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the MIPS PNX8550 platform. The warning indicates a potential issue with the initialization data annotation for the `arcs_cmdline` variable in the `prom_getcmdline()` function.

The patch adds the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function, which suggests that it should only be executed during the initialization phase. This annotation helps ensure that the function and its associated data are placed in the appropriate memory section.

Considering the patch addresses a section mismatch warning, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it primarily addresses a warning and does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Hence, my recommendation is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "Staging: hv: Properly handle the error in hv_acpi_init()"
   The patch title suggests that the patch aims to address an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function in the staging/hv/vmbus_drv.c file.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including K. Y. Srinivasan, Haiyang Zhang, Hank Janssen, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. This indicates that the patch has undergone review and approval by these individuals.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the hv_acpi_init() function. Previously, the function would return the result of vmbus_bus_init(irq) without handling any error that might occur during the initialization. The patch introduces error handling by assigning the result of vmbus_bus_init(irq) to a variable 'ret'. If 'ret' is non-zero, it means an error occurred, and the patch proceeds to unregister the vmbus_acpi_driver using acpi_bus_unregister_driver() before returning 'ret'.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses an error handling issue in the hv_acpi_init() function. It properly handles the error by unregistering the vmbus_acpi_driver if an error occurs during vmbus_bus_init(). This ensures that the driver is correctly cleaned up in case of an error.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a real issue related to error handling and does not contain any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses smatch warnings in the lm63.c file of the hwmon subsystem. The patch modifies some macros for consistency and to improve code readability.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it only addresses smatch warnings, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `list_tail_entry()` with `list_last_entry()` in `mm/zbud.c`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to keep a list of virtual interfaces (vifs) associated with the hardware (wl12xx). The patch includes modifications to the `main.c` and `wl12xx.h` files.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be adding trivial functionality rather than addressing any significant issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the clock data for OMAP4. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "greybus: interface: deactivate interface on enumeration failure". This suggests that it addresses an issue related to the Greybus interface.

2. The patch adds error handling code to deactivate an interface immediately on enumeration failure.

3. The patch includes error messages to log the failure reason.

4. The patch also includes calls to enable and add the interface.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by deactivating the interface on enumeration failure. It also includes proper error handling and logging. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only corrects the mask defines for certain registers in the WM8900 codec driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The change only modifies the return value of the function `ti_abb_init_table` from `-ENODEV` to `num_entries`. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the unnecessary use of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` function. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or address any security issues, it would be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that moves the `spin_lock_init()` function call after the error checking for the `kmalloc()` function. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve the stability or security of the code.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix that falls under the category of "spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc." and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `pr_err` and `pr_info` with `dev_err` and `dev_info` respectively. This change is made to provide more accurate log messages with the device name.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch changes the function `clk_get()` to `devm_clk_get()` in the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function. This change suggests that the patch is replacing the usage of `clk_get()` with the managed version `devm_clk_get()`. The managed version automatically handles resource cleanup, which can help prevent resource leaks.

2. The patch removes the `clk_put()` call in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This change suggests that the patch is removing the explicit clock release, as it is no longer necessary with the use of `devm_clk_get()`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing resource management in the ASoC rcar driver by using the managed version of the clock API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a trivial fix related to resource management.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that marks two functions as static in the exofs/ore_raid.c file. The functions are not used outside of this file, and marking them as static helps eliminate warning messages.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc.), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the start of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This is a good practice to ensure that the subsequent operations are performed correctly based on the interrupt mode. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

2. The patch also adds a validation check for the ring count only if it is going to change. This optimization avoids unnecessary validation when the ring count remains the same. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

3. The patch checks if the adapter's flags indicate that MSI-X mode is not enabled. If MSI-X mode is not enabled, it returns an error with an appropriate error message. This check ensures that the function does not proceed if the required support is not available. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

4. The patch checks if the `rx_count` provided in the `channel` structure is different from the current `drv_sds_rings` value in the adapter. If they are different, it performs a validation of the rings and updates the `drv_rss_rings` value accordingly. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

5. Similarly, the patch checks if the `tx_count` provided in the `channel` structure is different from the current `drv_tx_rings` value in the adapter. If they are different, it performs a validation of the rings. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

6. The patch removes the validation checks related to the interrupt mode and MSI mode from the `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function in `qlcnic_main.c`. These checks are no longer necessary as they are already performed in `qlcnic_set_channels()`. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch appears to fix a real and critical bug by optimizing ring count validations and ensuring proper interrupt mode checks. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue), and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing unnecessary messages), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch fixes an issue in the bcm_sf2 driver related to the port_vlan_ctl bitmask value.
   - It mentions that the value is now maintained by b53_device, and the local copy in bcm_sf2 needs to be replaced with the correct value.

2. Fixes:
   - The patch references a commit (f458995b9ad8) that introduced the migration of the bcm_sf2 driver to use the core B53 driver.
   - This indicates that the patch is fixing an issue introduced during the migration.

3. Code Changes:
   - In the bcm_sf2_port_setup function, the line `reg |= priv->port_sts[port].vlan_ctl_mask;` is replaced with `reg |= priv->dev->ports[port].vlan_ctl_mask;`.
   - This change updates how the vlan_ctl_mask value is obtained, using the b53_device instead of the local bcm_sf2 structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to the bcm_sf2 driver and ensures that the correct vlan_ctl_mask value is used. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) since it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "mtd: docg3: Don't leak docg3->bbt in error path" and is signed-off by Richard Weinberger and Brian Norris.

2. In the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the error handling path in the `doc_probe_device` function in the `docg3.c` file.

3. In the original code, there are two occurrences of the `goto nomem3` statement, which is used to handle memory allocation failures.

4. The patch replaces both occurrences of `goto nomem3` with `goto nomem4`.

5. After the second occurrence of `goto nomem4`, the patch adds a new line `kfree(docg3->bbt);` to free the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt`.

6. The patch does not introduce any new code or functionality but fixes a potential memory leak by freeing the `docg3->bbt` memory in the error path.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential memory leak issue and does not introduce any new functionality or trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p_jpeg_device_run and s5p_jpeg_runtime_resume callbacks. These callbacks alter device registers, which makes it critical to have spin_lock protection to prevent potential issues such as data corruption or race conditions.

The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to protect the critical sections of code. This ensures that the device registers are accessed safely and avoids potential concurrency issues.

Considering the nature of the fix and the potential impact on data integrity and system stability, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces "x != NULL" with "x". This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not provide any explanation or justification for the change.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to the ppc4xx_edac_match table. This macro generates the necessary module alias information for OF platform drivers, enabling module autoloading.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "[SCSI] be2iscsi: Fix SGL Initialization and posting Pages for Dual Chute". It mentions that the initialization of SGL (Scatter-Gather List) and related page posting is to be done for the chute based on the configuration value of each chute. It also states that for the BE-X family iSCSI protocol, it is loaded only on a single chute.

2. Signed-off-by:
   The patch is signed-off by John Soni Jose, Jayamohan Kallickal, and James Bottomley.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the file "drivers/scsi/be2iscsi/be_main.c" and makes the following changes:

   - Line 3450: A loop is added to iterate over the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers. If a ULP is supported, the loop breaks.
   - Line 3453: The variable "page_offset" is calculated based on the ULP number and other parameters.
   - Line 3946: The same loop as in line 3450 is added to iterate over the ULP numbers.
   - Line 4013: The same loop as in line 3450 is added to iterate over the ULP numbers.
   - Line 4031: The variable "ulp_icd_start" is assigned the value of "phba->fw_config.iscsi_icd_start[ulp_num]".

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the bug being fixed by this patch. However, it appears to address an issue related to the initialization of SGL and page posting for the chute. The changes involve iterating over ULP numbers and calculating offsets based on the ULP number.

   Without more context or information about the bug being fixed, it is challenging to determine whether the bug is critical or if it causes any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it is not clear if the changes are non-trivial or if they involve only spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

   Therefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).

Please provide more context or information about the bug being fixed or any additional details to further analyze the patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug or issue.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the regulator_ops structure for the mc13892_sw_regulator_ops. The change involves adding the map_voltage function to the structure.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. The flag is called "allow_runtime_pm" and is set to true for specific devices.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be adding a feature or functionality enhancement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: Handle the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring."
   - This suggests that the patch is related to handling interrupt requests for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver.

2. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Zhao Yakui and Daniel Vetter.
   - This indicates that the patch has undergone review and has been approved by individuals familiar with the codebase.

3. The code changes in the patch:
   - The patch modifies the gen8_gt_irq_handler() function in i915_irq.c.
   - It adds support for handling interrupts for both VCS1 and VCS2 rings.
   - If an interrupt is detected for VCS1 or VCS2, the corresponding ring is notified.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to handling interrupts for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces changes to handle interrupts for both VCS1 and VCS2 rings.

However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK) without additional information.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch fixes an uninitialized return variable in the function `request_code_segment()` in the `ft1000_download.c` file of the `ft1000` staging driver.

2. Problem:
   The return variable `status` is used uninitialized if the argument `boot_case` is false.

3. Solution:
   The patch initializes the `status` variable by assigning the return value of the `write_blk_fifo()` function.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential bug where the `status` variable could be used uninitialized. This bug could lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect results.

5. Impact:
   The bug does not cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue as it can lead to incorrect behavior.

6. Triviality:
   The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a non-trivial fix for an "oh, that's not good" issue. While it does not meet the criteria for critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, it still addresses a potential problem that could lead to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the clock ID for the "pclk_isp_in" clock in the Rockchip RK3288 clock driver. The change replaces a direct value with a symbolic constant, "PCLK_ISP_IN". 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "blk-mq-sched: check for successful allocation before assigning tag". This suggests that it addresses a potential issue related to the allocation of tags in the blk-mq-sched (block multi-queue scheduler) code.

2. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Bart Van Assche from SanDisk.

3. The patch modifies the function `blk_mq_sched_get_request` in the file `block/blk-mq-sched.c`.

4. In the original code, a request is allocated using the `__blk_mq_alloc_request` function, and then the allocated request is assigned to a specific tag in the `data->hctx->tags->rqs` array.

5. The patch adds a check to ensure that the allocation of the request was successful before assigning it to the tag. If the allocation fails, the request will not be assigned to any tag.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue in the blk-mq-sched code by adding a necessary check for successful allocation before assigning the request to a tag. Although the patch does not explicitly mention any critical bug or security issue, it seems to fix a potential problem that could lead to incorrect behavior or instability in certain scenarios.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch updates the naming for the "micd-timeout" property in the extcon-arizona device tree binding documentation. It adds the time units of -ms (milliseconds) to the property name. This change improves clarity and consistency in the documentation.

2. The patch also updates the code in the extcon-arizona driver to read the "micd-timeout-ms" property instead of the previous "micd-timeout" property. This ensures that the timeout value for microphone detection is specified in milliseconds.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a trivial fix that improves documentation and code consistency. It does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ASoC: delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time"
   - The patch aims to delay the initial jack detection by a specified debounce time.
   - This suggests that there might be an issue with the initial jack detection process.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch is signed-off by two individuals, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.
   - The patch modifies the file "sound/soc/soc-jack.c" at line 342.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 342: The initial jack status update is modified.
     - The previous code, `snd_soc_jack_gpio_detect(&gpios[i]);`, is replaced with `schedule_delayed_work(&gpios[i].work, msecs_to_jiffies(gpios[i].debounce_time));`.
     - This change schedules a delayed work to be executed after the specified debounce time.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses an issue related to the initial jack detection process. However, without further context or details about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the bug description, severity, and impact on the system. Please provide more context or details about the bug being fixed, and I will be able to give a more accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a redundant definition for `pgprot_writecombine`.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch only removes an explicit memset() call and replaces it with the __GFP_ZERO flag in the krealloc() function.

Since this patch does not fix any critical issue and only makes a minor change, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to microcode handling for AMD processors. The patch reads the CPUID(1).EAX leaf at the correct CPU and uses it to search for a matching microcode patch in an equivalence table. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to missing return statements in the nl802154_add_llsec_key() function. The patch adds a missing return statement to handle the case where certain attributes are not present, returning -EINVAL.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the calculation of the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used in the msi-available-ranges property. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect index assignments and cause issues with the handling of MSI interrupts on PowerPC systems.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could impact system functionality, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving a specific issue related to MSI handling.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the platform name from "omap-pcm-audio" to "omap-mcbsp.2" in the n810_dai structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple renaming of the platform name.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch is titled "ASoC: wm8994: Make sure we sync DAPM on WM8958 detection mode changes." It appears to address a specific issue related to the WM8958 audio codec driver in the ASoC subsystem.

The patch modifies the `wm8958_mic_detect` function in the `wm8994.c` file. It adds two lines of code to force enable or disable a pin (`CLK_SYS`) in the DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) context and then synchronizes the DAPM context.

Based on the provided patch and description, it seems that this change ensures that the DAPM context is properly synchronized when the detection mode changes for the WM8958 codec. This synchronization is necessary when the system enables or disables detection at runtime.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in -stable releases, this patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific scenario related to runtime detection mode changes for the WM8958 codec.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. As a result, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a sparse warning. The warning itself does not indicate a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, the patch does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the mma8450 driver. The patch adds the missing `i2c_set_clientdata()` function call in the `mma8450_probe()` function, which ensures that the client data is properly set for the I2C client.

Since this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference in the `mma8450_remove()` function, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq()` from `unsigned int` to `int`. This change is made because the function can eventually return a negative error code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch is considered a trivial fix as it only involves a type modifier deletion.

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch is (B) it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch appears to be a trivial fix that only involves renaming a function. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming two repository routines in the powerpc/ps3 code. The changes do not address any real or critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes do not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the `nes_reg_user_mr()` function.

2. The `ib_umem_release()` function is responsible for releasing the resources associated with an `ib_umem` object, which represents a user memory region.

3. The patch includes the necessary calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the error-handling code of `nes_reg_user_mr()`.

4. The error-handling code is triggered when `ib_copy_from_udata()` fails to copy data from user space to kernel space.

5. If `ib_copy_from_udata()` fails, the patch releases the `ib_umem` object and returns an error.

6. The patch also includes an additional call to `ib_umem_release()` before returning an error for a specific condition.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a potential resource leak by adding the missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the error-handling code. It addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes two lines of code. The lines being removed are related to setting the current x and y counts to zero in the enable_dma function.

Since it does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to add a check for the mx6quad variant to avoid a warning message related to disabling the 1.2 GHz OPP (Operating Performance Point) on a mx6solo.

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes are made in the `imx6q_opp_check_speed_grading` function in the `mach-imx6q.c` file. The existing check for `OCOTP_CFG3_SPEED_1P2GHZ` is modified to include an additional condition `cpu_is_imx6q()`.

3. Purpose of the Patch:
   The purpose of the patch is to prevent the warning message "failed to disable 1.2 GHz OPP" from being displayed on a mx6solo variant.

4. Impact of the Patch:
   The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a warning message related to disabling the 1.2 GHz OPP on a specific variant of the ARM mx6 processor.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a critical bug or a real issue that falls under the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to clear the hidden CPU state at reset time in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. It only sets the `vcpu->arch.hflags` to 0, which does not address any critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to report whether the interrupt was handled or not, instead of always reporting that it was handled.

2. It introduces a new variable called "handled" of type bool, initialized to false.

3. The function "tda998x_irq_thread" is modified to set "handled" to true when certain conditions are met.

4. If the interrupt was handled, the function schedules a delayed work or wakes up a wait queue.

5. The function returns IRQ_RETVAL(handled), which will return IRQ_NONE if "handled" is false, indicating that nothing was done.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch improves the reporting of whether the interrupt was handled or not. It introduces a mechanism to recover from stuck-IRQ problems and prevents the kernel from locking up. Since it addresses a real and critical issue related to interrupt handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only converts the code to use the new irq_alloc/free_hwirq interface without any functional change. Additionally, there are no indications of any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues being fixed.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch converts the i2c core to use the common attach/detach functions for PM domains, extending the support to include the generic PM domain as well.

2. The patch is signed-off by Ulf Hansson, reviewed by Kevin Hilman, and acked by Wolfram Sang. It is also reviewed by Dmitry Torokhov and signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki.

3. In the code changes, the previous ACPI-specific PM domain attachment and detachment functions are replaced with the generic dev_pm_domain_attach and dev_pm_domain_detach functions.

4. The patch modifies the i2c_device_probe function to use dev_pm_domain_attach instead of acpi_dev_pm_attach. It also adds a check for -EPROBE_DEFER to handle deferred probing.

5. The i2c_device_remove function is modified to use dev_pm_domain_detach instead of acpi_dev_pm_detach.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to be a non-trivial fix that extends the support for PM domains in the i2c core. It does not seem to fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the VPE (Virtual Processing Element) in the MIPS architecture. The patch checks if the weak symbol `vpe_run()` is defined and if it is not, it returns failure early without attempting to load the VPE.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a defensive check to avoid unnecessary operations when `vpe_run()` is not defined.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "usb: dwc2: host: add function to compare frame index"

Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for an indentation style issue in the ks7010_sdio.c file. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the dma-range size when the DT attribute is missing. It sets the size to dev->coherent_dma_mask + 1 instead of dev->coherent_dma_mask and adds code to check for invalid values of size configured in DT and log an error.

The patch also includes a Tested-by tag from Suravee Suthikulpanit, Signed-off-by tags from Murali Karicheri and Bjorn Helgaas, a Reviewed-by tag from Catalin Marinas, and an Acked-by tag from Will Deacon. It also includes several CC tags.

Based on this information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake RAPL in the powercap intel_rapl driver. The patch includes the necessary changes to the rapl_ids array to include the Gemini Lake CPU family.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the provided patch does not mention any specific bug or issue that it addresses.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. It is possible that this patch is adding support for a new CPU family, which may not necessarily fix a critical bug or address a significant issue. In such cases, it is generally not appropriate to include the patch in -stable releases.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further information about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch would be necessary to make a more definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring and splitting of the FPU initialization sequence into two parts: one for system initialization and one for per-CPU initialization. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `dev_{get|set}_drvdata` with `spi_{get|set}_drvdata` in the `mrf24j40` driver. This change allows for directly passing a `struct spi_device` instead of using `&spi->dev`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a NULL comparison style in the code. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that removes the MODULE_VERSION macro from the carl9170 driver in the Linux kernel. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of a cleanup or cosmetic change.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` to the `vce_v3_0.c` file in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu` directory. This function is responsible for setting the bypass mode for VCE 3.0.

2. The `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function reads the current value of the `GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `RREG32_SMC` and stores it in the `tmp` variable.

3. If the `enable` parameter is true, the function sets the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit in the `tmp` variable using a bitwise OR operation. Otherwise, it clears the `BYPASSECLK_MASK` bit using a bitwise AND operation.

4. Finally, the function writes the modified value of the `tmp` variable back to the `GCK_DFS_BYPASS_CNTL` register using `WREG32_SMC`.

5. The `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function in the same file checks if the `adev->asic_type` is `CHIP_POLARIS10`. If it is, it calls the `vce_v3_set_bypass_mode` function with the `enable` parameter based on the `state` parameter.

6. The patch also includes a check for `AMD_CG_SUPPORT_VCE_MGCG` in the `vce_v3_0_set_clockgating_state` function. If this flag is not set, the function returns 0.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a new function and modifies an existing function to support bypass mode for VCE 3.0 on the Polaris10 chip. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to initializing cl->tokens and cl->ctokens correctly in the htb_change_class function in the sch_htb.c file. The patch converts the values from ticks to nanoseconds using the PSCHED_TICKS2NS macro.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses an issue with incorrect initialization of cl->tokens and cl->ctokens, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the HTB queuing discipline. This can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues. However, incorrect initialization of critical variables can lead to unexpected behavior, which can potentially cause hangs, data corruption, or other issues.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the initialization issue.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
false || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference error in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds a NULL check for the 'match' variable before using it. 

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch converts the control and DAPM initialization in the ASoC wm8940 codec driver to a table-based approach. It replaces the existing audio_map with wm8940_dapm_routes and wm8940_dapm_widgets. It also removes the wm8940_add_widgets function and modifies the initialization in the wm8940_probe function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It appears to be a code refactoring or optimization rather than addressing a specific issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the "funcs" argument in two functions: drm_fb_cma_alloc() and drm_fbdev_cma_create_with_funcs(). 

Since this patch only adds the "const" qualifier to function arguments, it does not fix any real or critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues. Additionally, it does not introduce any new functionality or improve existing functionality.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real issue related to freeing sk_buffs under certain locks, causing TX/RX freezes and latency spikes. The patch introduces the ability to defer skb freeing by adding the rtnl_kfree_skbs() function and modifies the qdisc_reset_queue() and __qdisc_reset_queue() functions to handle the new behavior.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause performance issues and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to address the issue of not properly starting/stopping the phy device when using phydev in the mv643xx_eth driver.

2. The patch adds the missing calls to phy_start and phy_stop in the port_start and mv643xx_eth_stop functions, respectively.

3. The patch includes the necessary checks to ensure that the phy device is valid before calling phy_stop in mv643xx_eth_stop.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to properly starting/stopping the phy device in the mv643xx_eth driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential problem that could lead to data corruption or other issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real or critical bug. The patch only replaces the calculation of `tmp` with a call to `usb_endpoint_maxp_mult()`. Since this change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue, it can be considered a trivial fix.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for cleaning up coding style issues in the clk-bcm2835.c file. The patch does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It only focuses on fixing checkpatch complaints and improving coding style.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a code style warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `call->conn->params.peer` with `call->peer` in multiple places within the code. This change is made to avoid potential issues when `call->conn` becomes NULL.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames a constant from "RSND_GEN2_SRU" to "RSND_GEN2_SCU" in the rcar_snd.h header file. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a simple renaming for clarity or consistency purposes.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the file `fs/proc/kcore.c` and specifically the function `elf_kcore_store_hdr`.

2. The change is to replace the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy` for copying the `saved_command_line` string into `prpsinfo.pr_psargs`.

3. The reason for this change is to ensure that the destination string is always null-terminated, even if the source string is longer than the destination buffer size.

4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple improvement to ensure null termination of a string.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a struct and associated variable. This type of change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues that would warrant inclusion in a stable release.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: staging: comedi: ni_atmio16d: use comedi_buf_write_samples()
   - The patch title suggests that the patch is related to the staging driver for the National Instruments ATMIO16D device in the Comedi subsystem.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch suggests using the comedi_buf_write_samples() function to add the sample to the async buffer for better aesthetics.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 220: The existing code uses comedi_buf_put() to add a sample to the async buffer.
   - The patch replaces the comedi_buf_put() call with comedi_buf_write_samples() and modifies the code to read the sample value into the 'val' variable before passing it to comedi_buf_write_samples().

4. Analysis:

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the file_ops.c file in the staging/rdma/hfi1 directory. It introduces a new function called `usable_device` that checks if a device is available for general use by verifying if its driver link state is active. This function is then used in the `get_user_context` function to filter out devices that are not currently active.

The changes made by the patch ensure that only devices with active links are considered when looking for or validating a user device. This helps prevent potential issues that could arise from using inactive devices.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to device availability and usage. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ASoC: arizona: Ensure we clock two channels for I2S mode"
   - The patch aims to ensure that two channels are clocked for I2S mode, even for mono data.

2. Patch Changes:
   - Line 818: Adds a new variable "val" to store the value read from a register.
   - Line 834-841: Checks if the number of channels is 1 and if the I2S mode is enabled. If so, it forces stereo mode by doubling the target bit clock rate.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch addresses a specific issue related to I2S mode in the arizona codec driver.
   - It ensures that even for mono data, stereo clocking is used, which is required for I2S mode.
   - The patch modifies the code to force stereo mode by doubling the target bit clock rate when necessary.

Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it is a trivial change that makes the `register_disk()` function static. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a sparse warning in the `net/nfc/digital_technology.c` file. The warning suggests that the symbol `digital_tg_send_sensf_res` was not declared and asks if it should be static.

The patch addresses this warning by making the `digital_tg_send_sensf_res` function static. This change restricts the visibility of the function to the current translation unit, which is generally considered good practice unless there is a specific reason for it to be externally visible.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather addresses a sparse warning and improves code quality, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a debug entry for GCA configuration data in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes changes to the amdgpu_device.c file to add the debugfs entry and the corresponding read function.

Upon analyzing the patch, it does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it adds a debug feature for GCA configuration data.

Since the patch does not address any critical issues and contains only additions for debugging purposes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of v4l2_ctrl_handler freeing and v4l2_device unregistration in the em28xx-v4l extension. The patch ensures that these functions are called whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a cleanup or improvement rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

However, without further information about the nature of this feature and any associated bug fixes or improvements, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more details about the purpose and impact of the fast-xmit feature, as well as any potential risks or issues it may introduce. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if this patch addresses any specific bugs or critical issues.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether the patch should be accepted or not.
false || Based on the provided patch, it seems that the declaration of the function `release_uids` is being removed from `sched.h` because there is no such function in the codebase. The patch also includes the Acked-by and Signed-off-by tags from Serge Hallyn and Eric W. Biederman respectively.

Since this patch is removing a declaration for a non-existent function, it does not fix any real bug or issue. Additionally, it does not address any critical problem such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a trivial fix, as it only removes unused code.

According to the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused argument from the function `clear_shadow_scan`. Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it only involves removing unused code, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only sets the return value to 0 when `master->transfer_one` returns a positive value, and then waits for completion. This does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to auxtrace data alignment in the perf tools. The patch allows the auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size, which is necessary for certain scenarios like BTS where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing trace statement in the ext4_ext_map_blocks() function. This trace statement is meant to trace blocks punched out when the function is called by punch_hole.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for two new system calls, sched_setattr and sched_getattr, to the microblaze architecture. 

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the deprecated IRQF_DISABLED flag from the nokia-modem.c driver in the HSI subsystem. The patch itself does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a cleanup change rather than a fix for a problematic behavior.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it falls under the category of a whitespace cleanup. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Hence, my decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning related to a quoted string split across lines in the dgnc_cls.c file. This warning does not indicate a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that involves renaming a macro and fixing some stylistic issues. It does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the type of the variable "max_buffer_heads" from int to unsigned long. This change is made to prevent potential overflow when calculating the value of "max_buffer_heads" from "nr_free_buffer_pages()".

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ".owner" field for the "artpec6-pinctrl" driver. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue. The patch allows X.509 certificates to be blacklisted based on their TBSCertificate hash. While this feature may be convenient and align with UEFI's blacklist, it does not address any of the specified criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the deletion of the AP station in the iwlwifi driver. The patch modifies the behavior of deleting the station by marking it as unused instead of directly deleting it. This change aims to prevent confusion and potential issues when the device expects the station to be present while the associated bit is set.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific issue related to the behavior of the iwlwifi driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding accessor functions for the GCR_L2_CONFIG register in the MIPS architecture. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial change that adds register accessors.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that marks the function `dwc_dump_chan_regs` as inline. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "[SCSI] qla2xxx: No fcport FC-4 type assignment in GA_NXT response." It suggests that there is an issue with the fcport FC-4 type assignment in the GA_NXT response.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Armen Baloyan, Saurav Kashyap, and James Bottomley.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the qla2x00_ga_nxt function in the qla_gs.c file.

4. Code Analysis: The patch adds the following code snippet:

```
fcport->fc4_type = (ct_rsp->rsp.ga_nxt.fc4_types[2] & BIT_0) ?
    FC4_TYPE_FCP_SCSI : FC4_TYPE_OTHER;
```

This code assigns the fc4_type of the fcport based on the value of the fc4_types array in the GA_NXT response. If the third element of the array has its first bit set, the fc4_type is assigned as FC4_TYPE_FCP_SCSI; otherwise, it is assigned as FC4_TYPE_OTHER.

5. Impact Analysis: Based on the code changes, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to the fcport FC-4 type assignment in the GA_NXT response. However, without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the issue.

6. Triviality Check: The patch does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further information about the bug being fixed and its impact is required for a more accurate assessment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential bug in the Linux kernel related to IPv6 packet fragmentation. The patch replaces the existing code that uses `BUG()` to report an error with `BUG_ON()`.

The `BUG_ON()` macro is a debugging aid that checks if a given condition is true and triggers a kernel panic if it is. This helps in identifying and debugging critical issues during development and testing.

In this case, the patch replaces the `BUG()` call with `BUG_ON()` in the `ip6_fragment()` function, specifically in the `skb_copy_bits()` call. This change ensures that if the `skb_copy_bits()` function fails to copy the IP datagram block, it will trigger a kernel panic.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a potential critical bug that could lead to data corruption or other issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a trivial fix. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the `dvb_unregister_device()` function. Since the function itself already checks for NULL and returns immediately, the additional check is redundant.

However, the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be more of a code cleanup or optimization rather than addressing a critical problem.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to clean up the code by moving release handles into fail labels. This is a code organization improvement and does not fix any real or critical bug.

2. The patch does not address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

3. The changes made in the patch are trivial and do not involve any critical fixes. They mainly involve moving code lines and adding fail labels.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch does not meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding functionality to the TWL6030 MFD (Multi-Function Device) driver by implementing the irq_set_wake() function. This function allows TWL6030 client drivers to make use of irq_wake() for waking up the application processor on specific IRQ events.

Since this patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, and it does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is reverting the check for PERF_EVENT_STATE_EXIT on the read syscall path in the perf subsystem. The reason for this change is that it breaks the standard way to read the counter, which is to open the counter, wait for the monitored process to die, and then read the counter.

The patch has been reported by Stephane Eranian and signed-off by Jiri Olsa. It has also been acknowledged by Stephane Eranian and Peter Zijlstra. There are several other individuals who have been copied on the patch for information.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in a Linux -stable release, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a functional change to revert a check that was causing issues with the standard way of reading the counter.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the hfi1_query_qp function is being removed from the staging/rdma/hfi1/qp.c file. The function is then no longer being used in the codebase.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any issues mentioned earlier.

In this case, the patch does not seem to fix any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be a removal of a function that is no longer used.

Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix, as it does not address any critical issues. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, the correct decision for this patch would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that the issue occurs when the kernel reboots and the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called.

2. The patch suggests not updating the buffer tail if it is reset.

3. The code change in the patch checks if the circular buffer is empty before updating the buffer tail.

4. If the circular buffer is not empty, the buffer tail is updated using the formula `(xmit->tail + uart->tx_count) & (UART_XMIT_SIZE - 1)`.

5. Additionally, if the number of pending characters in the circular buffer is less than `WAKEUP_CHARS`, the `uart_write_wakeup` function is called.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it is reset during kernel reboot. The patch ensures that the buffer tail is only updated if the buffer is not empty, and it also includes a check for pending characters in the buffer before calling `uart_write_wakeup`.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch titled "ARM: i.MX5x clocks: Add EPIT support" adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem. It includes additions to the enum `imx5_clks` to define new clock identifiers for EPIT gates. Additionally, it adds clock initialization and registration code for EPIT1 and EPIT2.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or addresses any specific issues. The patch appears to be adding support for a new feature rather than fixing an existing problem. Therefore, it does not seem to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Considering this analysis, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to updating the scan response data in the Bluetooth management code. The patch updates the correct variables (`scan_rsp_data_len` and `scan_rsp_data`) instead of mistakenly updating the advertising data variables (`adv_data_len` and `adv_data`).

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption in Bluetooth management, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch title suggests that it converts the usage of `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` in `bond_debugfs.c` file, specifically in the `bond_debug_register` and `bond_debug_reregister` functions.

2. The change replaces the `pr_warn` calls with `netdev_warn` calls, which is a more appropriate function for printing warnings related to network devices.

3. The change does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The change does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an issue related to debugfs registration, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). While it may not fix a critical bug, it improves the code by using the appropriate function for printing warnings related to network devices.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds the "const" qualifier to the declaration of the "decon_crtc_ops" structure. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a simple code cleanup or optimization.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue with setting the `mask_pos` correctly in the PCI MSI capability initialization function.

2. The original code incorrectly assigns `entry->mask_pos` based on the result of the expression `dev->msi_cap + (control & PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT) ? PCI_MSI_MASK_64 : PCI_MSI_MASK_32`. The issue is that the `+` operator has higher precedence than the `?:` operator, causing unexpected behavior.

3. The patch modifies the code to use an if-else statement to correctly assign `entry->mask_pos` based on the value of `control & PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT`. If the condition is true, `entry->mask_pos` is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_64`, otherwise, it is set to `dev->msi_cap + PCI_MSI_MASK_32`.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. It addresses a minor issue with operator precedence but does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a version update for the tg3 driver in the Linux kernel. However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is simply updating the version number and release date.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release, I would recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies the code by using the `builtin_platform_driver()` helper. This change does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/msm: use drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence." It suggests using the function drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane.

2. Patch Details:
   The patch modifies the msm_atomic_commit() function in the msm_atomic.c file. It adds a call to drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to set the fence for the plane_state. This change is made when the plane's framebuffer (fb) is different from the current plane_state's framebuffer and the plane_state's framebuffer is not NULL.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and details, it appears that the patch aims to improve the setting of the fence for the plane in the msm_atomic_commit() function. It introduces the use of drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() to handle the fence setting more efficiently.

   However, it is important to note that the patch does not address any specific bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than fixing a critical issue.

   Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. Conclusion:
   Considering the analysis, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It does not fix a critical bug or address any real issue. Therefore, the decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please let me know if you need further analysis or if you have any other patches to evaluate.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that converts the usage of a variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address a real and critical bug. The patch is focused on creating clock aliases purely from DT data, which does not fall under the criteria of fixing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the return value of the `efivarfs_file_write()` function in the `efivars.c` file. The patch addresses a sign issue by changing the type of the `bytes` variable from `size_t` to `ssize_t`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a potential sign issue, which is not considered critical.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to newer versions of gcc and variable-sized arrays in structs. The patch addresses the issue by using pointer arithmetic instead of indexing the arrays directly.

However, based on the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a code improvement or compatibility fix rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch moves the "estab_plinks" member outside the "mesh_stats" debug group. This change is made because "estab_plinks" is not a statistics member and should not be shown along with other mesh stat members.

2. The patch adds the "estab_plinks" debugfs attribute to the mesh files. The attribute is added with a mode of 0400, indicating that it is readable only.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a code cleanup or reorganization change.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only addresses a sparse warning. The change declares the function `ieee80211_TURBO_Info` as static to fix a "symbol was not declared" warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add locking for the vbuf pool in the virtio-gpu driver. The patch introduces a new spinlock, `free_vbufs_lock`, and uses it to protect access to the `free_vbufs` list.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential concurrency issue by adding locking.

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug and contains a "trivial" fix (adding locking), it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the iwl4965 driver. The patch addresses the non-success return paths where memory allocated by iwl4965_sta_alloc_lq() in iwl4965_alloc_bcast_station() is not freed. This can lead to memory leaks in certain scenarios, such as when the card isn't ready or when the card is hardware-rfkilled.

The suggested fix includes deallocating the broadcast stations before returning an error in the __il4965_up() function. This ensures that the memory is properly freed in these error cases.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can cause memory leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue that can lead to resource exhaustion and instability in the system.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that eliminates the send buffers in the GSI receive QP. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that updates the xenfs filesystem to use kuid and kgid instead of setting the i_uid and i_gid fields directly. This change is made in the xenfs_make_inode function.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new functionality related to pipeline power management in the future. This indicates that it is not fixing an existing bug but rather adding a feature.

2. The patch also includes a fix for a documentation bug related to a warning message.

3. The main changes in the patch are in the `media_device_register_entity` function and the `media_device_cleanup` function. In `media_device_register_entity`, the patch introduces a check to ensure that the graph walk object is large enough for all entities in the graph. If it is not, a new graph walk object is created and the old one is cleaned up. In `media_device_cleanup`, the patch adds a cleanup step for the `pm_count_walk` graph walk object.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be adding a new feature and fixing a documentation bug.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a useless conditional branch. The change simply assigns `napi->skb` to `skb` without any additional checks. Since `napi->skb` is already NULL, there is no risk of any bad behavior.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It also does not address any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a minor optimization.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of waiting for the GPU to be idle before moving the buffer object (BO) to system cached memory in the ttm_bo_swapout function. The previous code had a wait for the GPU before the move, but it was removed in this patch.

The patch then checks if the BO's placement is not already in the desired swap_placement. If it is not, it sets up a new memory region for eviction and moves the BO to the system cached memory.

After the move, the patch ensures that the BO is idle by calling ttm_bo_wait with the "false" parameter for interruptible and "false" parameter for no_wait. If the return value of ttm_bo_wait is non-zero, indicating an error, it jumps to the "out" label and handles the error.

Finally, the patch unmaps the virtual address of the BO and completes the swapout process.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue where the BO may not be idle before the move, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real and critical bug related to data corruption or hangs. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes redundant declarations of functions in the perf/x86/intel/bts driver. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch adds support for the AR9580 device in the ath9k driver. However, the patch does not provide any details about the bug it fixes or any critical issues it addresses. Without this information, it is difficult to determine whether the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue that this patch aims to fix.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Summary: The patch removes the 'i8254_osc_base' data from the boardinfo structure in the pcl816 driver.

2. Patch Details:
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the struct pcl816_board.
   - The 'i8254_osc_base' field is removed from the boardtypes[] array for the "pcl816" and "pcl814b" board types.
   - In the pcl816_ai_cmdtest() function, the i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function is called with the constant value I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ instead of the board's 'i8254_osc_base' value.
   - Similarly, in the pcl816_ai_cmd() function, the i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function is called with the constant value I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ instead of the board's 'i8254_osc_base' value.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch removes the 'i8254_osc_base' field from the boardinfo structure, indicating that it is the same for all board types. This suggests that the field is not necessary and can be removed.
   - The removal of the 'i8254_osc_base' field from the boardtypes[] array for the "pcl816" and "pcl814b" board types indicates that these boards no longer require this field.
   - The i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() function is called with the constant value I8254_OSC_BASE_10MHZ instead of the board's 'i8254_osc_base' value. This change ensures that the same value is used consistently across all boards.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch removes unnecessary and redundant code related to the 'i8254_osc_base' field. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a wait for one vblank before disabling CRCs in the i915 driver. The purpose of this change is to avoid a spurious interrupt warning.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, it does not contain any non-trivial fixes.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new member `resource` to the `struct drbd_device` in the `drbd_int.h` header file. This member is then assigned a value in the `drbd_create_minor` function in `drbd_main.c` and used in the `drbd_adm_prepare` function in `drbd_nl.c`.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds a new member to a structure, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to locking during traversal of the xpt_list in the svcrpc module.
2. The bug occurs during shutdown when server threads are not running, but svc_age_temp_xprts may still be running.
3. The patch introduces a new parameter `struct svc_serv *serv` to the `svc_close_list` and `svc_clear_list` functions.
4. The `svc_close_list` function acquires the lock `serv->sv_lock` before traversing the xprt_list and setting flags on the xprt objects.
5. The `svc_clear_list` function also acquires the lock `serv->sv_lock` before traversing the xprt_list, moving the xprt objects to a temporary list, and then deleting them.
6. The `svc_close_net` function calls `svc_close_list` and `svc_clear_list` for both `sv_tempsocks` and `sv_permsocks` lists, and also clears the pools associated with the given network.
7. The patch ensures proper locking during the traversal and modification of the xprt_list, preventing potential race conditions.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug related to locking during shutdown in the svcrpc module. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring rather than fixing a real and critical bug. The patch is factoring out the function `sdhci_set_default_irqs()` from the `sdhci_init()` function.

Since the patch does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of the `led_info` structure in the `leds-pca963x.c` file. The patch initializes the `led` structure completely by using the `{}` initializer, which ensures that all fields are properly initialized.

Since this patch fixes a bug that could potentially lead to uninitialized data and does not contain any trivial changes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a helper function called `dwc3_core_fifo_space` to the `dwc3` USB driver. This helper function is used to retrieve the available space in different queues and FIFOs in the `dwc3` controller. The purpose of this helper function is to facilitate debugging and potentially enable remote wakeup for starting a transfer when there is data in a TX FIFO.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be more of a debugging and performance enhancement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a check to disallow world-writable files in sysfs. This fix does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that removes a space before a semicolon. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the specified issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only modifies the values of n, m1, and m2 in the code. These changes do not fix any real and critical bugs, nor do they address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug. The patch only changes the return type of the `drm_pci_agp_init` function from `int` to `void`. This change does not address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other critical issues.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any new functionality or improve the existing code. It simply removes the return statement from the `drm_pci_agp_init` function, which does not have any impact on the behavior of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "netfilter: bridge: free nf_bridge info on xmit". It suggests freeing nf_bridge information after POST_ROUTING, as it is only needed for -m physdev. This change aims to improve performance by freeing the allocation on the same CPU.

2. The patch includes a new function called `nf_bridge_info_free`, which frees the nf_bridge information in the given `skb` if it exists.

3. In the `br_nf_push_frag_xmit` function, `nf_bridge_info_free` is called before pushing the skb to the bridge device queue for transmission.

4. In the `br_nf_dev_queue_xmit` function, `nf_bridge_info_free` is called before pushing the skb to the bridge device queue for transmission. However, this call is conditional based on `skb_is_gso` and `skb->protocol` checks.

5. The `br_nf_dev_queue_xmit` function also includes an alternative implementation for systems without CONFIG_NETFILTER enabled. In this case, `nf_bridge_info_free` is called unconditionally before pushing the skb to the bridge device queue.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch aims to improve performance by freeing nf_bridge information when it is no longer needed. It does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it falls under the category of code cleanup and optimization.

According to the given criteria, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the `interval_tree.c` file of the Lustre staging driver. It does not address any real or critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix warnings related to pointer-to-integer casts and pointer-to-integer casts of different sizes when compiling a 64-bit kernel. These warnings are not critical issues that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. They are more related to code quality and potential portability concerns.

Since the patch does not address a critical bug or a real issue that affects the stability or security of the Linux kernel, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of hardcoding it to the bit used by current Tegra GPUs. This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the IOMMU functionality.

2. The patch adds a new member, "iommu_bit," to the "gk20a_instmem" structure. This member will store the IOMMU bit value.

3. In the "gk20a_instobj_dtor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to clear the IOMMU bit instead of hardcoding the specific bit (34) used for unmapping pages.

4. In the "gk20a_instobj_ctor_iommu" function, the patch modifies the code to set the IOMMU bit instead of hardcoding the specific bit (34) used for resolving addresses through the IOMMU.

5. In the "gk20a_instmem_new" function, the patch assigns the IOMMU bit value from the platform data to the "iommu_bit" member of the "gk20a_instmem" structure.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch is addressing a specific issue related to the IOMMU functionality in the "gk20a_instmem" module. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the code to use the IOMMU bit specified in platform data instead of hardcoding it. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that replaces the module_init and module_exit calls with the module_i2c_driver macro. This change simplifies the code by eliminating the explicit initialization and cleanup functions.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unused function callback `ppgtt->enable()`. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a new function `nvme_free_queue_mem()` to free the memory allocated for the admin queue in case of initialization failure. This function is then called in the `nvme_configure_admin_queue()` function when the initialization fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to resource leakage. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new function and modifies the existing code to call it appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a coding style warning. It does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that marks the function `blkdev_mmap()` as static. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch allows vendor commands that require the WIPHY_VENDOR_CMD_NEED_RUNNING flag to be sent to the NAN (Neighborhood Aware Networking) interface.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Andrei Otcheretianski, Luca Coelho, and Johannes Berg, who are all associated with Intel.

3. Code Changes: The code changes in the patch modify the nl80211_vendor_cmd function in the nl80211.c file.

4. Analysis of Code Changes:
   - The patch adds an additional condition to the if statement on line 11258.
   - The new condition checks if the wireless device (wdev) is not associated with a network device (netdev), is not in P2P (Peer-to-Peer) mode, and is not in NAN mode.
   - If any of these conditions are true, the function returns -ENETDOWN, indicating that the network is down.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific scenario related to vendor commands and the NAN interface. It does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for obtaining the BOS (Binary Object Store) descriptor test scenario for USB 3.0 in the usbtest module. 

This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be adding a new feature or enhancement to the usbtest module.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to a dentry leak in the greybus driver. The patch removes the debugfs file and disables USB logging, which helps prevent potential resource leaks and improves system stability.

However, without further context or information about the severity of the bug, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical issue that meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. Additionally, the patch does not mention any specific bug or security issue that it addresses.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases) for this patch. However, a more thorough analysis and understanding of the bug and its impact would be necessary to make a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding stub functions for v_sys, refclk, and unipro resource management in the greybus subsystem. These stub functions are currently not implemented and return 0.

Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bug, and it only adds stub functions without any implementation, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to ensure that tasklets are killed upon driver removal in the edma driver. It specifically targets vchan tasklets and ensures they are killed to prevent their execution after the driver is removed.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch introduces a new function called `edma_cleanupp_vchan` which is responsible for cleaning up and killing the vchan tasklets associated with the dma device. This function is called in the `edma_remove` function to clean up the vchan tasklets before unregistering the dma device.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a specific issue related to tasklets in the edma driver. It ensures that the vchan tasklets are properly cleaned up and killed upon driver removal, preventing any potential issues that may arise from their execution after removal.

   Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves introducing a new function and making changes to the `edma_remove` function.

   Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug related to tasklet handling in the edma driver.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "ARM: shmobile: bockw: fixup FPGA ioremap area"

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch removes the static keyword from the declaration of the `fpga` variable.
   - It adds a call to `iounmap(fpga)` to unmap the FPGA ioremap area.

3. Analysis:
   - The patch seems to address a specific issue related to the FPGA ioremap area on the shmobile bockw board.
   - It removes the static keyword from the `fpga` variable, which suggests that the variable may need to be accessed or modified by other parts of the code.
   - The addition of `iounmap(fpga)` indicates that the FPGA ioremap area needs to be unmapped to avoid potential issues.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to the FPGA ioremap area and ensures proper cleanup by unmapping the area. However, without further context or details about the bug or its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug being fixed, its severity, and whether it meets the criteria of causing a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some other critical issue.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the AXP20X and AXP22X battery drivers to the MFD cells of the AXP209, AXP221, and AXP223 MFDs. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply adds checks for NULL or error pointers and returns early if they are encountered.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds definitions for Skylake stepping revision IDs. This patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It also does not fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves adding the "const" qualifier to the "ops" member of the "ds2404" structure and the "ds2404_chip_ops" structure. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It is a simple constification of the structures.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for unregistering the connector during component removal in the Exynos HDMI driver. The patch adds the necessary calls to unregister and cleanup the connector in the `hdmi_connector_destroy` function.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for sharing the interrupt handler in the dwc3-omap driver. This change is necessary for OMAPs to handle OTG events on the same IRQ and share it with the OTG device driver.

Considering that this patch addresses a specific issue related to interrupt handling and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch fixes a bug related to the pageflip finish event for interlace mode in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs.

2. Bug Description:
   The bug occurs when checking the top field vsync in interlace mode. The comparison is done between a DMA address converted by start coordinates and a non-converted DMA address. This leads to incorrect pageflip finish event handling.

3. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `mixer_irq_handler` function in the `exynos_mixer.c` file. It introduces two new variables, `base` and `shadow`, and updates the existing variable `val_base` to `base`. The patch also modifies the comparison conditions for `base` and `shadow` with the DMA addresses of the window data.

4. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch addresses a specific bug related to the pageflip finish event in interlace mode. It introduces necessary changes to correctly compare the DMA addresses. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis, including testing and review by kernel maintainers, is necessary to make a final decision.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and does not consider any external factors or dependencies.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a flag to indicate that a recovery work was initiated on purpose to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set.

2. The BUG_ON() macro is modified to include an additional condition that checks if the bug_on_recovery flag is set and if the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is not set in the wl->flags bitfield.

3. In the wl1271_op_add_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before initiating the recovery work.

4. In the wl1271_op_remove_interface() function, the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag is set before queuing the recovery work.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a necessary fix to avoid triggering a BUG() when the bug_on_recovery module parameter is set. It also ensures that the recovery work is initiated intentionally by setting the WL1271_FLAG_INTENDED_FW_RECOVERY flag.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a new function called `nve0_fifo_intr_engine` to the `nve0_fifo_priv` structure in the `nve0.c` file. This function triggers a specific event (`nouveau_event_trigger`) for the given `priv` object.

2. In the `nve0_fifo_intr` function, there is a condition that checks if a specific bit (`0x80000000`) is set in the `stat` variable. If the condition is true, the `nve0_fifo_intr_engine` function is called, and then some register writes and bit manipulation are performed.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is adding functionality to handle a specific condition in the `nve0_fifo_intr` function. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if this patch fixes a real and critical bug or if it falls into the category of a "trivial" fix.

To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue being addressed and its impact on the system's stability, security, or functionality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that simplifies boolean tests by removing unnecessary comparisons.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a potential scheduling issue caused by calling `clk_get_rate()` in `sdhci_s3c_set_clock()`, which may sleep. The patch modifies the driver to cache the rates of all bus clocks at probe time and then only use those cached values.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of the `mtd_oob_ops` structure in the `nand_base.c` file. The patch initializes the structure using `memset` instead of explicitly setting the `datbuf` and `oobbuf` fields to `NULL`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that improves code readability and follows good practice by zeroing out unused fields.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a line length issue and a blank line issue in the code. These types of changes, such as removing comments and adjusting line lengths, are considered cosmetic and do not fix any real or critical bugs.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The patch only fixes the default value of gpio_base when no device tree node exists for a device with CONFIG_OF_GPIO defined. This does not seem to fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: "f2fs: detect error of update_dent_inode in ->rename"
   The patch aims to detect errors in the update_dent_inode function during the rename operation in the f2fs filesystem.

2. Patch Description:
   The patch adds error checking and handling for the update_dent_inode function in the f2fs_rename function. It checks the return value of update_dent_inode and handles the error appropriately.

3. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch modify the f2fs_rename function in the fs/f2fs/namei.c file. Specifically, it adds error handling for the update_dent_inode function.

4. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential error in the f2fs filesystem during the rename operation. It checks the return value of the update_dent_inode function and handles the error by releasing the orphan inode and jumping to the appropriate cleanup code.

   Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it involves error handling and ensuring the correct behavior of the filesystem.

   Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds support for different MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths.
2. If only one region is specified, it is assumed to be shared between Rx and Tx for backward compatibility.
3. If the MMIO regions are different and Rx is not specified, the Tx channel is assigned to Rx.
4. The patch modifies the mbox_test_device structure to include separate tx_mmio and rx_mmio pointers.
5. The mbox_test_message_write function checks if tx_mmio and signal are not NULL before printing and sending the signal.
6. The mbox_test_receive_message function checks if rx_mmio is not NULL before receiving and printing the message.
7. The mbox_test_prepare_message function checks if tx_mmio is not NULL before preparing and sending the message.
8. The mbox_test_probe function remaps the resources for tx_mmio and rx_mmio.
9. If rx_mmio is not specified but has a separate MMIO region, the Rx channel is set to the Tx channel.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds support for separate MMIO regions for the Tx and Rx paths in the mailbox-test driver. It also handles cases where only one region is specified or when Rx is not specified but has a separate MMIO region. The changes seem to address potential issues and improve the functionality of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical issue related to the mailbox-test driver and does not contain any trivial fixes.
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a line over 80 characters warning detected by the checkpatch.pl script. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary variables and simplifies the code. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to passing the wrong value as an argument for PTR_ERR() in the ALSA fireworks driver. The patch correctly assigns the return value of memdup_user() to the 'buf' variable and then checks if it is an error using IS_ERR(). However, the patch incorrectly uses PTR_ERR(data) instead of PTR_ERR(buf) when returning the error value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a trivial fix for a potential error in the code.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial change that does not fix a real and critical bug or address any significant issue. The patch only involves inlining the ATS setup code into the `pci_ats_init()` function, without any functional change.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or addressing a significant issue, and it is a trivial change, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code refactoring patch that breaks up the handle_cmd_completion() function into smaller functions for better code readability. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "_single" suffix from the page table allocator function names. This change does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to have any significant impact on the functionality or stability of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that renames the parameter 'dma_mask' to 'max_addr' in the blk_queue_bounce_limit() function.

Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional change.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is as follows:

Title: ste_dma40: Delete an unnecessary variable initialisation in d40_probe()
Description: The variable "res" will eventually be set to a resource pointer from a call of the d40_hw_detect_init() function. Thus, let us omit the explicit initialization at the beginning.

After reviewing the patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an unnecessary variable initialization. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue occurs when Q_GETNEXTQUOTA is called for a filesystem with quotas disabled, causing an oops. This bug can lead to unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.

2. The patch fixes the problem: It adds an early check to verify if the filesystem has quotas enabled before proceeding with ocfs2_get_next_id(). If quotas are not enabled, the function returns -ESRCH, indicating that the filesystem does not have quotas and preventing the oops.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It focuses on fixing the critical bug and does not include any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial modifications.

4. The patch includes a signed-off-by line: This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the author, Jan Kara.

Based on these factors, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and improve the stability and reliability of the ocfs2 filesystem.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a change related to ACPI Power Management Timer (PM Timer) in the ACPICA subsystem. The patch makes the PM Timer optional, aligning with ACPI 5.0A specifications.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `acpi_get_timer` function in `drivers/acpi/acpica/hwtimer.c` to check if the PM Timer is optional before reading the timer value. If the PM Timer is not present, it returns `AE_SUPPORT` status.

2. Similarly, the `acpi_get_timer_duration` function is modified to include the same check for the optional PM Timer.

3. In `drivers/acpi/acpica/tbfadt.c`, the `fadt_info_table` is updated to reflect that the PM Timer is optional according to ACPI 5.0A.

4. The `acpi_tb_validate_fadt` function is modified to remove the check for the PM Timer being required.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is making the PM Timer optional, aligning with ACPI 5.0A specifications. However, it does not fix any real and critical bug or address any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a feature enhancement or compliance update.

Therefore, based on the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting this patch (B) in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the deprecated function `simple_strtoul` with the recommended function `kstrtoul`. This change improves the code by using a more strict function that filters invalid input.

However, this patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It is a simple code improvement that does not address any significant issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes an extra variable declaration. Since it does not fix a real and critical bug, and it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix (removing a variable shadowing a previous definition), I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for whitespace issues in the `spidev_test` file. The changes include fixing indentation and removing trailing whitespace. Since this patch does not fix any real or critical bug, and it only contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch increases the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw module.

2. It adds a new variable "maxdelay" and initializes it to 1000.

3. It checks if the current channel is set in the ath_hw structure. If it is, it adjusts the "maxdelay" based on whether the channel is half or quarter rate.

4. It writes a value to the AR_Q_TXD register to abort the transmission DMA.

5. It sets some bits in various registers to force quiet collision, clear virtual MAC filter, and force channel idle high.

6. It sets a global IFS (Inter-Frame Spacing) parameter to ignore backoff.

7. It iterates over the QCU (Queue Control Unit) queues and waits for a certain delay before proceeding to the next iteration. The delay is determined by the "maxdelay" value.

8. Inside the loop, it introduces a 5 microsecond delay using the udelay() function, except for the first iteration.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch modifies the behavior of the ath9k_hw module by increasing the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It also does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a non-critical enhancement rather than a bug fix. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that only reformats pointer variables in the main.c file to meet kernel coding standards. It does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || This patch is a trivial fix that renames the driver from "ohci" to "ohci-da8xx" in the davinci ohci driver. It does not fix any real or critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Additionally, it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix as it only involves a spelling change. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the hwmon driver for the LM63 chip. The patch adds information about the LM64 and LM96163 chips having separate pins for fan monitoring and alert out, and that fan monitoring is always enabled on the LM64.

Since this patch is only a documentation update and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes unnecessary iteration and uses the passed argument directly. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing module license to the dwc-xlgmac driver. This fix addresses a warning about the lack of a license when building the driver as a module.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/nouveau/device: type-safe register accessor macros" and it aims to introduce type-safe register accessor macros for the nvkm_device structure in the Nouveau DRM driver.

2. The patch modifies the nvkm_device structure by adding privileged register interface accessor macros.

3. The added macros provide read and write access to registers using the ioread and iowrite functions, respectively.

4. The nvkm_mask macro is also added, which performs a read-modify-write operation on a register by applying a mask and value.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch introduces necessary changes to improve the type safety and register access in the Nouveau DRM driver. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue it addresses, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make a final decision, I would need more information about the bug or issue this patch aims to fix and whether it falls under the categories of critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, real security issues, or other significant issues.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and purpose.

The patch appears to be related to the ARM OMAP2+ platform and specifically addresses the use of pdata quirks for wl12xx on VAR-STK/DVK-OM44. It adds a new function `var_som_om44_legacy_init` that initializes the wl12xx with specific parameters.

1) The patch fixes two bugs in the __lpc_handle_xmit() function of the lpc_eth driver.

2) The first bug is that it can leak skbs (socket buffers) if TXSTATUS_ERROR is set. This bug can potentially lead to resource leaks and memory issues.

3) The second bug is that it can wake up the txqueue even when no slot was freed. This bug can cause incorrect behavior and potential race conditions.

4) The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the author and the reported/tested-by tags from the individuals who reported and tested the patch.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes real and critical bugs that can cause incorrect behavior and resource leaks. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a missing break statement in the set control handler of the tvp5150 driver. It fixes a potential issue where the hue control could enable or disable the decode completely.

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The Tilera boot infrastructure now provides the initramfs to Linux with a different name, "initramfs", instead of "initramfs.cpio.gz". This change allows for the use of different compression techniques without causing confusion.

2. The patch ensures compatibility with older kernels: By falling back to checking for the old name ("initramfs.cpio.gz"), the patch ensures that older kernels remain compatible with the newer Tilera boot infrastructure.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a significant change in the boot infrastructure and requires adapting the code to handle the new name.

4. The patch includes proper documentation: The commit message provides clear explanations of the changes made and the reasons behind them.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug: The commit f2411da746985 introduced async probe support but failed to add the required argument, causing a crash when the async_probe generic module parameter is used.

2. The bug is critical: The crash caused by the missing argument can be considered a "real and critical bug" as it affects the stability and functionality of the kernel.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses the missing argument issue, which is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by relevant developers: The patch is signed-off by Luis R. Rodriguez and Rusty Russell, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. The patch is recommended for stable releases: The patch is marked for inclusion in stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org (4.2+)), indicating that it is considered important for maintaining the stability of the kernel.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference in the bcm2835_i2c_isr() function. This bug was introduced in the commit e2474541032d, which fixed a hang issue for writing messages larger than 16 bytes.

The patch adds a check for a NULL curr_msg pointer before accessing its flags. If the curr_msg pointer is NULL, it logs an error message indicating an unexpected interrupt. Otherwise, it proceeds with the existing logic.

Given that this patch addresses a potential crash scenario and improves error handling, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes the srcline translation for call chains of user space applications. The patch modifies the code to use `addr_location::addr` instead of `ip` for entries.

Since this patch addresses a specific issue related to call chain translation and improves the accuracy of the reported information, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. It does not seem to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch addresses an issue in the perf probe feature where kprobes fail to find symbols even if they exist in the map (dso). Currently, the code relies on map__load() to load the map and filter symbols, which doesn't work for kprobes. The patch proposes using map__find_symbol_by_name() instead, which loads a map with full symbols and sorts them by name.

The patch also modifies the find_probe_trace_events_from_map() function to use the new symbol search method and introduces the find_probe_functions() function to find probe functions in a map.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a real issue related to kprobes failing to find symbols in the map. This issue can potentially cause debugging and performance analysis problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the code related to setting the 'action' to 'idle' in the md (multiple devices) subsystem. The issue arises when checking the 'sync_thread' variable without holding the 'mddev_lock'. This can lead to a race condition where md_check_recovery could reap the thread and start another thread, causing confusion.

The patch proposes a solution by introducing a check for the MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING flag before proceeding with the code block. If the flag is set, the patch ensures that the flush, test, and reap operations are performed under the 'mddev_lock' to avoid any race condition with md_check_recovery.

The patch also includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the issue. This helps in tracking the fix and understanding the context.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to confusion and potential issues in the md subsystem. It does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving the race condition. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the debugfs entry creation path in the f2fs filesystem. It moves the initialization of the "status" debugfs entry to the init part of f2fs and the destruction to the exit part. This change ensures that the "status" entry is maintained for the entire F2FS filesystem, regardless of the number of partitions.

The patch also introduces two new functions: f2fs_create_root_stats and f2fs_destroy_root_stats. The f2fs_create_root_stats function creates the debugfs directory "f2fs" and the "status" file within it, while the f2fs_destroy_root_stats function removes the debugfs directory.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch improves the initialization and destruction of the debugfs entry in the f2fs filesystem. However, it does not address any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, the changes made by the patch do not seem to fall under the category of "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the timing of the set_sched_topology call in the s390 topology initialization code.

2. The patch suggests using the smp_cpus_done() call to ensure that the s390 specific topology array is registered early enough.

3. The patch also introduces a new function, early_topology_init(), which is called during early system initialization.

4. The early_topology_init() function calls set_sched_topology(s390_topology) to set the s390 topology.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a timing issue in the s390 topology initialization code and ensures that the s390 specific topology array is registered early enough. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch removes the "blocked" flag from the mlx4_en_tx_ring structure. The rationale behind this change is that the flag is redundant and can lead to a race condition.

2. The patch replaces the check of the "blocked" flag with the netif_tx_queue_stopped function to avoid the race condition.

3. In the mlx4_en_process_tx_cq function, the patch modifies the condition for waking up the Tx queue. Instead of checking the "blocked" flag, it now checks if the queue is stopped and at least one packet was completed.

4. In the mlx4_en_xmit function, the patch removes the setting of the "blocked" flag and modifies the condition for stopping the Tx queue. Instead of setting the flag, it directly stops the queue.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of the Tx queue in the mlx4_en driver. It removes the redundant "blocked" flag and replaces it with a more appropriate check using the netif_tx_queue_stopped function.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential race condition and improves the handling of the Tx queue, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak in the error path of the function `rsi_send_auto_rate_request()` in the `rsi_91x_mgmt.c` file. The patch frees the previously allocated `skb` in case memory allocation for the `selected_rates` array fails.

Since this patch addresses a potential memory leak, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it does not fall under the category of an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HID i2c-hid driver and its interaction with GPIO support in the kernel.

2. The patch fixes a bug introduced by a previous commit (a485923efbb8) that did not handle the case when gpiolib is not enabled in the kernel configuration.

3. The fix involves checking the return value of acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios() against -ENXIO and 0, and only failing the probe if the return value is not -ENXIO or 0.

4. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Gabriele Mazzotta, and it is signed-off by Mika Westerberg and Jiri Kosina.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to the HID i2c-hid driver and its interaction with GPIO support. The bug could potentially cause issues such as build errors or failures in certain configurations. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation of percpu_ref_tryget() and percpu_ref_tryget_live() can result in a reference leak, leading to hangs and potential data corruption during CPU hotplug during I/O.

2. The bug is described with a sample stack trace, indicating that it can cause hangs in blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait, which is a critical issue.

3. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the fix. It mentions that the return value from atomic_long_inc_not_zero() can have high bits set, causing the tryget routines to return "false" even when a reference is acquired. This leads to a reference leak as the caller assumes it doesn't need to call percpu_ref_put().

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the issue.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including the original author and other maintainers.

6. The patch includes a link to the bug report where the issue was reported, providing additional context and information.

7. The patch modifies the tryget routines to use an actual boolean internally instead of truncating the atomic long result to an int, which should fix the reference leak issue.

Considering all these factors, it seems that this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential security issue by preventing the leakage of kernel stack memory to userland. This is achieved by setting the `msg_namelen` member to 0 in the `hash_recvmsg` and `skcipher_recvmsg` functions.

Since the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption and potentially be exploited for malicious purposes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

   - In the struct vp_rpt_id_entry_24xx, the reserved_4 array size is changed from [28] to [24].
   - This change reduces the size of the reserved_4 array by 4 bytes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a valid fix for a specific issue introduced by a previous commit. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it modifies the size of an array. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or its impact, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further evaluation by the appropriate maintainers and reviewers to determine if this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug related to the nvme/pci controller. The bug causes an 'nvme reset /dev/nvme0' command to block forever because the queues were never frozen. The patch addresses this issue by accounting for the controller state when deciding whether to freeze the queues.

Considering that the bug can lead to a hang and the patch fixes the issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to storing the status of registers in the s390/kvm code. The patch ensures that the ACRS/FPRS registers are up-to-date before saving them into the save area. This fix addresses potential issues with stale register values and strange problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect register values and potential issues with hotplug and virtio-ccw. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue where errors in add_probe_trace_event() are not passed to debuginfo__find_trace_events(), causing a segfault if perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob.

2. The patch ensures that add_probe_trace_event() does not modify tf->ntevs and tf->tevs if the functions fail.

3. The patch includes a clear_probe_trace_event() function to handle the case when add_probe_trace_event() fails. It also frees the allocated memory and decrements tf->ntevs.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a critical bug that can cause a segfault and improves the stability of the perf tool when probing with a glob.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough review of the code changes and testing may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function in `fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c`. This change ensures that the `s_dirty` flag is checked correctly before proceeding with the checkpoint. This is a bug fix that addresses a potential issue with the checkpoint process. It is a valid fix for a critical bug, so it meets the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases.

2. The patch also removes a condition in the `f2fs_sync_fs` function in `fs/f2fs/super.c`. The removed condition checks if `s_dirty` is false and if there are no dirty nodes before returning 0. This condition is no longer necessary because the check for `s_dirty` has been moved to the `write_checkpoint` function. Removing this condition does not introduce any new bugs or issues, and it simplifies the code. Therefore, it can be considered a valid change.

Based on the analysis, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to the checkpoint process and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to handle races with hardware (HW) when updating the next alarm time in the drm/nouveau/tmr driver.

2. The patch introduces a fix to address a potential race condition that could result in a delay of approximately 4 seconds until the alarm triggers.

3. The fix involves checking again after updating the HW to ensure that the alarm timestamp is still in the future.

4. The patch includes the necessary locking mechanism to protect the alarm list during processing.

5. It also handles the case when there are no more pending alarms by shutting down the interrupt.

6. Finally, the patch executes the completed alarm callbacks.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to potential race conditions with HW and ensures that alarms are triggered correctly. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to the timekeeper in the Linux kernel. The issue was reported and tested by Andreas Schwab, and the patch is signed-off by John Stultz and Thomas Gleixner.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that it fixes an issue specific to an Access Point (AP) configuration. When the AP is started with WEP security and an external station is connected, the data path works. However, if the AP is restarted with WPA/WPA2 security, the station can connect but ping fails.

2. The patch addresses the issue by removing a redundant check that skips the deletion of WEP keys if the interface type is AP.

3. The Fixes tag references a specific commit that introduced the issue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the AP when transitioning from WEP to WPA/WPA2 security. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a real issue related to the generation of a flood of warning messages by usbnet. The patch introduces a ratelimit mechanism to mitigate the excessive generation of these messages.

However, the patch does not address the underlying problem in usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism, which can result in dropped and unhandled events. The patch only mitigates the fallout caused by the current implementation.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses an issue that can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ci13xxx_udc driver. The bug causes bogus data to be sent because the driver assumes that the request has already been mapped. The patch addresses this issue by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that reduces the memory footprint for debugging purposes. The patch removes the usage of `hex_dump_to_buffer()` and replaces it with a kernel helper function `printk()` to dump up to 64 bytes. The actual size being dumped is only 15 bytes.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or a security issue, and it is a trivial fix related to debugging, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for unused return smatch warnings in the `tcmu_netlink_event` function in `drivers/target/target_core_user.c`. The warnings indicate that the return values of `nla_put_string` and `nla_put_u32` are not being used.

Since this patch addresses only unused return warnings and does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a minor cleanup for the FRAC_BITS value in the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial cleanup rather than a fix for a critical issue. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the S25FL127S nor flash part. The patch adds a wait loop after writing to the configuration register to ensure that the flash finishes its work before any further accesses are made. This prevents potential failures in rootfs mounting and filesystem corruption.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and system instability, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to VLAN_TAG_PRESENT in the netvsc_recv_callback() function in the netvsc_drv.c file.

2. The patch suggests calling __vlan_hwaccel_put_tag() only if the packet comes from a VLAN. This is done to prevent VLAN_TAG_PRESENT from being added in all cases.

3. The patch includes a Reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Olaf Hering.

4. It also includes a Signed-off-by tag from Haiyang Zhang, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them.

5. Additionally, it includes a Reviewed-by tag from K. Y. Srinivasan, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them as well.

6. Finally, the patch includes a Signed-off-by tag from David S. Miller, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them as the maintainer of the netvsc_drv.c file.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue related to VLAN_TAG_PRESENT and has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals, including the maintainer. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue with an uninitialized struct in the rtl8192cu driver. The patch adds a call to memset to clear the struct before it is used.

Since this patch fixes a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial changes like spelling or whitespace fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the generation of "__enabled_" prefixed macros in the autoconf.h file. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "USB: quatech2: fix use-after-free in TIOCMIWAIT". It mentions that the port wait queue should be used and the serial disconnected flag should be checked before accessing private port data after waking up. This is necessary because the private port data, including the wait queue, can be gone after a disconnect.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch modifies the code in the `wait_modem_info` function, where it replaces `priv->delta_msr_wait` with `port->delta_msr_wait` in the `wait_event_interruptible` call. It also adds a check for `port->serial->disconnected` before returning -EIO.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a use-after-free issue in the TIOCMIWAIT functionality of the quatech2 USB serial driver. It ensures that the wait queue is properly used and checks for the serial disconnected flag to avoid accessing private port data that may have been freed after a disconnect. This fix is important as it prevents potential crashes or data corruption.

4. Impact:
   The patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption or crashes. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without introducing any trivial changes.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch aims to fix an overflow condition in the `pool_find_page()` function of the `dmapool` module.
   - When a DMA pool is at the very top of the `dma_addr_t` range, the calculated end address of the pool wraps around to zero, causing page lookup failures.
   - The patch intends to make the relevant calculation overflow-proof.

2. Patch Analysis:
   - The patch modifies the comparison condition in the `pool_find_page()` function.
   - The original condition `(dma < (page->dma + pool->allocation))` is replaced with `((dma - page->dma) < pool->allocation)`.
   - The new condition calculates the difference between `dma` and `page->dma` and checks if it is less than `pool->allocation`.
   - This change ensures that the calculation is not affected by overflow issues.

3. Impact Assessment:
   - The patch addresses a specific issue related to DMA pools and the `pool_find_page()` function.
   - It fixes a potential bug that can cause page lookup failures when a DMA pool is at the top of the `dma_addr_t` range.
   - The issue can potentially lead to data corruption or other unexpected behavior.
   - The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and does not contain any trivial fixes.

1. The patch aims to unmap any mapped MMIO regions when detaching a userspace context.
2. It adds a new parameter `struct address_space *mapping` to the `cxl_context_init` function.
3. It initializes the `mapping` field in the `cxl_context` structure and adds a new `mapping_lock` mutex.
4. In the `__detach_context` function, it releases the Problem State Area mapping by unmap_mapping_range if `ctx->mapping` is not NULL.
5. It adds the `mapping` field and `mapping_lock` to the `struct cxl_context` in `cxl.h`.
6. It adds the `mapping` parameter to the `cxl_context_init` function in `cxl.h`.
7. In `file.c`, it passes the `inode->i_mapping` as the `mapping` parameter when calling `cxl_context_init` in the `__afu_open` function.
8. In `file.c`, it sets `ctx->mapping` to NULL in the `afu_release` function.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real issue related to detaching a userspace context by unmapping the MMIO regions. It introduces new fields and a mutex to handle the mapping and ensures that the mapping is released correctly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the mmc_cd_gpio_free() function in the cd-gpio.c file of the MMC (MultiMediaCard) subsystem. The patch adds a check for a NULL context before freeing resources, preventing a potential oops if mmc_cd_gpio_free() is mistakenly called on a driver cleanup path.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a potential issue that could lead to an oops in a specific scenario.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it does not address a critical bug or a significant issue. As per the guidelines, "trivial" fixes should not be included in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the pmd_present implementation in the ARM architecture. The issue is that pmd_present does not take into account the valid bit, resulting in incorrect behavior when pmd_mknotpresent is used.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the pmd_present implementation to consider the valid bit. It also mentions that this issue only affects the 3-level case and provides a fix before the fix to pmd_mknotpresent for bisectability.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior in the ARM architecture. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the third argument of the `addrconf_dst_alloc` function from 0 to `false`. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any of the mentioned issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. 

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to timestamping support in slave mode for old hypervisors. The patch disables the timestamping capability for slave mode and displays a warning message.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

From the patch description, it seems that the issue is related to the lack of support for timestamping in slave mode for old hypervisors. While this may not directly cause a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption, it could potentially be considered a "real and critical bug" or an "oh, that's not good" issue.

Considering the criteria, it is reasonable to assume that the lack of timestamping support in slave mode could have significant implications for certain use cases or environments. Therefore, this patch could be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

Based on this analysis, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix an oops issue in the musb_gadget_pullup() function of the USB driver. The oops occurs when the gadget driver calls usb_gadget_connect() without the USB cable being plugged into the OTG port. The issue is caused by accessing MUSB's memory space while its clock is turned off due to pm_runtime kicking in.

To fix the issue, the patch encloses musb_gadget_pullup() with pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put() calls to ensure that the path is always reached with the clock turned on.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause an oops, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further review and testing may be necessary to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or side effects.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to extend the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board connector quirk to cover a newer silicon stepping with a new PCI ID. The patch adds the new PCI ID (0x9806) to the condition that checks for the board (0x9802) and the subsystem vendor and device IDs.

Since this patch addresses a specific hardware issue and extends the existing quirk to cover a newer silicon stepping, it can be considered a fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to callchains in the perf subsystem on x86 architecture. The patch disables a check that compares the frame pointer (fp) with the stack pointer (RSP) in the perf_callchain_user32 and perf_callchain_user functions.

The patch description mentions that without this patch, callchains for applications with two different stack regions may get truncated, even when frame pointer chaining is present. The patch aims to address this issue by disabling the (fp < RSP) check and relying on other checks in the code to handle the situation correctly.

However, the patch does not provide any specific details about the real and critical bug that this change fixes. It also does not mention any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other "oh, that's not good" issues that the patch addresses.

Without more information about the bug and its impact, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch fixes a return value check in the usbhs_mod_gadget_probe() function in the renesas_usbhs driver. It addresses an issue where the usb_get_phy() function can return ERR_PTR() in case of an error, but the existing code checks for NULL instead. The patch replaces the NULL test with IS_ERR() to correctly handle the error condition.

The patch also includes the Fixes tag, which references the commit that introduced the issue, indicating that it is a bug fix. Additionally, it has been Acked-by Yoshihiro Shimoda, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a relevant developer.

Since the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

3. Analysis: The patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a deadlock. Deadlocks can cause system hangs and impact system stability. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

4. Trivial fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch fixes a warning in the of_free_opp_table() function.

2. Purpose: The patch aims to prevent a warning from being triggered when OPP (Operating Performance Points) is not defined for a device. It also handles the case where an invalid device is passed to the function.

3. Code Changes: The code changes involve modifying the error handling logic in the of_free_opp_table() function.

4. Analysis:
   a. The patch checks if dev_opp is an error pointer using the IS_ERR() macro.
   b. If dev_opp is an error pointer, it checks the error value using PTR_ERR().
   c. If the error value is -ENODEV, the function returns without triggering a warning.
   d. If the error value is not -ENODEV, it triggers a warning using the WARN() macro.
   e. The warning message includes the device name or "Invalid device" if dev is NULL or an error pointer.

5. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a warning and handle the case of an invalid device gracefully. It does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it addresses an "oh, that's not good" issue by preventing unnecessary warnings and potential crashes.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix since it does not address a critical bug. As per the given criteria, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is intended to fix a regression introduced by commit 027bd7e89906 in the xenbus_dev_request_and_reply() function. The regression causes failed XS_TRANSACTION_START messages to leave the transaction open, which can lead to problems with suspend and migration.

The patch itself removes the early return statement that was added accidentally, which was causing the transaction to remain open even when XS_TRANSACTION_START messages failed.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can impact system stability and functionality, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new software pte flag called L_PTE_NONE. This flag is set to identify faulting, present entries. The patch modifies several files in the ARM architecture, including pgtable-2level.h, pgtable-3level.h, pgtable.h, proc-macros.S, proc-v7-2level.S, and proc-v7-3level.S.

After analyzing the patch, it seems that it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new software pte flag for identifying faulting, present entries.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to interrupt routing for GEN9 hardware in the drm/i915 driver. The patch ensures that RPS interrupts are correctly routed to the CPU instead of the GT. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a specific behavior related to interrupt routing, which may not fall under the category of a critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error return code in the `btrfs_init_test_fs()` function. The patch ensures that a negative error code is returned from the `kern_mount()` error handling case instead of 0, which is set by `register_filesystem`. This change is consistent with the behavior in other parts of the function.

Since this patch addresses a real bug by fixing an error return code, it can be considered for inclusion in a stable release. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the ratelimit code that can lead to improper suppression of log messages. The bug occurs when the `rs->begin` value is set to 0 instead of `jiffies` when `rs->interval` is passed. This causes the time interval check to always be false, resulting in `rs->printed` not being properly initialized.

The patch correctly addresses this issue by setting `rs->begin` to `jiffies` instead of 0. This ensures that the time interval check works as intended and `rs->printed` is properly initialized.

Considering that this bug can lead to incorrect log message suppression, which can impact debugging and troubleshooting efforts, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues in the system's behavior and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "net: udp: do not report ICMP redirects to user space." It suggests that ICMP redirects should not be reported to user space as they are not considered error conditions.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the error handling code in the udp4_lib_err() function in net/ipv4/udp.c and the udp6_lib_err() function in net/ipv6/udp.c.

   In udp4_lib_err():
   - The case for ICMP_REDIRECT is modified to use a "goto out" statement instead of a "break" statement. This change ensures that the error handler leaves without touching the socket.

   In udp6_lib_err():
   - The case for NDISC_REDIRECT is modified to use a "goto out" statement instead of just updating the PMTU. This change ensures that the error handler leaves without touching the socket.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the code changes, it appears that the patch aims to prevent reporting ICMP redirects to user space in both IPv4 and IPv6 UDP error handling. ICMP redirects are not considered error conditions, and the patch ensures that the error handler does not touch the socket in these cases.

   This patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a functional change to improve the behavior of the error handling code.

4. Conclusion:
   Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not meet the requirements. It does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue. Therefore, the appropriate decision would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be necessary for a final decision.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a regression in HDMI audio functionality for the nv84 GPU. The patch adds missing code that was removed during a code refactoring commit, resulting in HDMI audio working again.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of HDMI audio, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, there are a few factors to consider before making a final decision:

1. Testing: The patch author mentions that they were only able to test it on the first HDMI head and that it might be necessary to add similar code for nva3. It is important to ensure that the patch has been thoroughly tested on different hardware configurations to verify its effectiveness.

2. Code Quality: It is essential to review the added code to ensure it is correct and does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

3. Code Impact: Assess the impact of the patch on the overall codebase. Ensure that it does not introduce any unnecessary complexity or negatively affect other parts of the system.

Considering these factors, I would lean towards accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases, pending further testing and code review.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the RGMII_MODE_EN bit in the bcmgenet driver. The patch correctly updates the value of RGMII_MODE_EN from 0 to 6, which is necessary for newer GENET controllers to enable their RGMII data-pad.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause issues with newer GENET controllers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the `md/raid5` module. The bug is described as `drop_one_stripe()` being called with `max_nr_stripes == 0`, which should not be allowed. The patch adds a test to ensure that `max_nr_stripes` is always kept above `min_nr_stripes` and uses a 'mask' instead of a 'mod' operation to ensure the validity of the 'hash' variable.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Reasoning:
The patch addresses a real issue related to the redundant disabling of the ADS7846 regulator in the ads7846_remove() function. The warning message about unbalanced disables for vads7846 indicates a potential problem that needs to be resolved.

The patch removes the redundant regulator_disable() call and keeps the valid one in ads7846_disable(). This change ensures that the regulator is disabled only once, resolving the warning message and preventing any potential issues caused by unbalanced disables.

The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing a specific bug that can lead to warnings and potential problems.

Therefore, the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be included.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a specific quirk for the Acer Aspire 5734Z machine to invert the panel backlight brightness value. This patch does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a specific hardware-related fix for a particular machine.

Therefore, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. I would recommend giving it a (B) NAK.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Telit LE910 V2 mobile broadband card in the cdc_ncm driver. The patch adds a new entry in the `cdc_devs` array with the USB device and interface information for the Telit LE910 V2.

Since the patch is adding support for a specific device, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a specific device support addition, which can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content and purpose.

The patch is titled "ASoC: Disable register synchronisation for low-frequency WM8996 SYSCLK." It addresses an issue where register synchronization may occasionally take too long to take effect, causing I/O issues. The patch aims to disable synchronization to avoid these issues.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, the following modifications are made in the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function:

1. A new variable `sync` is introduced and initialized with the value of `WM8996_REG_SYNC`.
2. In the `case 32000` and `case 32768` blocks, the `sync` variable is set to 0, disabling synchronization.
3. The `sync` variable is used to update the `WM8996_CONTROL_INTERFACE_1` register using `snd_soc_update_bits`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue related to register synchronization for low-frequency SYSCLK in the WM8996 codec. Disabling synchronization in specific cases is done to avoid I/O issues.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause I/O issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current code in paging_init() fails to detect unsupported highmem due to dcache aliasing, leading to potential coherency issues or triggering a BUG_ON in flush_kernel_dcache_page().

2. The patch fixes the bug by running paging_init() later than cpu_cache_init(), ensuring that the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro evaluates correctly and the unsupported highmem case is detected successfully.

3. The patch also resolves an additional issue: mem_init_free_highmem() attempts to free all highmem pages, even though they are not used and lack valid page structs. This leads to an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception. The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates to true, avoiding the issue.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating that it has undergone peer review.

Considering the critical bug fix and the avoidance of potential issues, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to duration calculation for non-aggregated packets in the ath9k wireless driver. The patch overrides the length in ath_tx_fill_desc before passing it to ath_buf_set_rate, ensuring correct duration calculation.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: Yes, it fixes a broken duration calculation for non-aggregated packets, which can impact the proper functioning of the ath9k wireless driver.

2. The bug causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue: While the patch does not explicitly mention any of these issues, a broken duration calculation can lead to incorrect behavior and potentially impact the stability and performance of the wireless driver.

3. The patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes: The patch does not appear to be a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to duration calculation.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug in the ath9k wireless driver without containing any trivial fixes.

true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "ath9k: fix draining aggregation tid buffers". It suggests a fix for an issue related to draining tid (Traffic Identifier) buffers in the ath9k wireless driver.

2. Problem Description:
   After a transmission attempt, an A-MPDU (Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit) subframe can still have fi->retries at 0 if the retry count wasn't incremented due to powersave. In such cases, the subframe is still tracked as part of the block ack window. However, when draining the tid queue, the sequence number of the subframe needs to be cleared from the pending frame bitmap.

3. Patch Details:
   The patch modifies the `ath_tid_drain` function in the `ath9k` driver's `xmit.c` file. It removes the conditional check for `fi->retries` and unconditionally calls `ath_tx_update_baw` to update the block ack window with the sequence number of the subframe. The `ath_tx_complete_buf` function is then called to complete the buffer transmission.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to draining tid buffers in the ath9k driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves modifying the logic for updating the block ack window. However, without further context or knowledge of the severity of the issue, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make a final decision, I would need more information about the severity of the bug, its impact on system stability, and whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential buffer overflow issue in the HFS file system. The patch adds a sanity check for the file name length and limits it to HFS_NAMELEN if it exceeds that value.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential security issue (buffer overflow) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the information provided.

The patch is titled "drm/i915: quirk asserts controllable backlight presence, overriding VBT" and was committed on April 9, 2014. It addresses a regression caused by a misconfigured VBT on certain machines. The patch adds a quirk to assert the presence of a controllable backlight and uses it to ignore the VBT backlight presence check during backlight setup.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. In the `i915_drv.h` file, a new quirk flag `QUIRK_BACKLIGHT_PRESENT` is defined.
2. In the `intel_display.c` file, a new function `quirk_backlight_present` is added to apply the backlight present quirk.
3. In the `intel_panel.c` file, the `intel_panel_setup_backlight` function is modified to handle the backlight setup based on the VBT and the new quirk.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to misconfigured VBTs and ensures that the backlight presence is correctly detected. It does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix as it does not address a critical issue.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to double accounting in the cpu-timer code.
2. The issue is caused by adding the delta for the calling task twice, which leads to the sample run ahead and a shorter sleep.
3. The patch modifies the `cpu_timer_sample_group()` function in `kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c` to remove the double accounting.
4. The patch removes the `task_delta_exec()` function from `kernel/sched/core.c` as it is no longer needed.
5. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by and Cc tags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause incorrect behavior in the system. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix UVD suspend and resume for VI APU in the amdgpu driver.

2. Code Changes: The code changes involve adding conditional checks to skip suspend and resume operations for APUs.

3. Impact Analysis: The patch appears to address a specific issue related to UVD suspend and resume for VI APU. It does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it seems to address an issue that could potentially cause problems during suspend and resume operations for VI APUs.

4. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential "oh, that's not good" issue. While it may not meet the criteria for a critical bug, it addresses a specific issue that could impact the functionality of UVD suspend and resume for VI APUs.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a non-trivial issue and improves the stability of the amdgpu driver for VI APUs.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is reverting the default behavior of link protections in the Linux VFS (Virtual File System) due to compatibility issues with some applications. The patch sets the sysctl variables `sysctl_protected_symlinks` and `sysctl_protected_hardlinks` to 0, effectively disabling the link protections.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It addresses a compatibility issue and reverts a default behavior. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: a possible race condition between mr tree insert and delete in mlx5_core_destroy_mkey().

2. The patch ensures that the mr is first removed from the radix tree before destroying it, preventing a potential race condition if the key was reallocated.

3. The patch also handles radix tree insert/delete failures and logs a warning message if an error occurs during insertion.

4. In mlx5_core_destroy_mkey(), the patch adds code to delete the mr from the radix tree and checks if the deletion was successful. If the deletion fails, it logs a warning message and returns an error.

5. The patch then proceeds to destroy the mkey using the mlx5_cmd_exec() function.

6. After destroying the mkey, the patch checks the status of the command execution and returns an error if the status is non-zero.

7. Finally, the patch removes the mr from the radix tree again, even though it was already deleted earlier. This redundant deletion is unnecessary and can be removed.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential race condition and handles radix tree insert/delete failures, improving the reliability and stability of the mlx5_core module. However, the redundant deletion code should be removed before merging the patch.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not take into account any broader context or dependencies.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to md_check_recovery calling ->add_disk more often than necessary, causing unnecessary work and excessive info messages.
2. The issue does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue.
3. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential candidate for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the final decision depends on the maintainers and the severity of the issue.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a locking bug in the SELinux/NetLabel glue code. The bug can cause a suspicious RCU usage error, which can potentially lead to system instability. Therefore, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues like hangs or data corruption.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses solely on fixing the locking bug.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a memory leak in the query device function of the mlx5 driver for InfiniBand.
2. The fix involves freeing the dev->port when RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) cannot be enabled or when node data initialization fails.
3. The patch is associated with the commit "0837e86a7a34" that added per port counters.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Mellanox and reviewed by Mark Bloch.
5. The patch is also signed-off by Leon Romanovsky and Doug Ledford.
6. The code change occurs in the "mlx5_ib_add" function in the "drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/main.c" file.
7. If the initialization of node data fails or RoCE cannot be enabled, the patch jumps to the "err_free_port" label, which frees the dev->port and then continues with the error handling.
8. The patch does not introduce any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a memory leak, which can be considered a critical bug that can lead to resource exhaustion and potential system instability. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes and has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the driver could crash on machines with more cores than the maximum number of offload queue sets allowed. This could be considered a critical bug as it can lead to system instability.

The patch modifies the `cfg_queues` function in the `cxgb4_main.c` file. It replaces the line `i = num_online_cpus();` with `i = min_t(int, MAX_OFLD_QSETS, num_online_cpus());`. This change ensures that the number of offload queue sets (`ofldqsets`) is capped at the minimum value between `MAX_OFLD_QSETS` and the number of online CPUs.

Based on the criteria provided, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a real and critical bug that can cause the driver to crash on machines with more cores than the maximum allowed. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch tablet (056a:00d0) in the HID: wacom driver. The issue is that the device is being removed before the mode setting can be executed due to the introduction of delayed work for querying the mode on all tablets.

The patch cancels the delayed work and calls the _wacom_query_tablet_data() function to set the mode on the ghost pen interface before removing the device. This ensures that the mode setting is executed before the device is removed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a specific fix for the Bamboo Touch tablet.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing spinlock initialization in the aq_ring structure in the Aquantia Ethernet driver. The patch initializes the lock using the `spin_lock_init()` function.

Since this patch addresses a missing initialization, it does not fall under the category of a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Additionally, the missing spinlock initialization could potentially lead to synchronization issues or race conditions, which can cause hangs or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to issues in the system.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that can cause GPU hangs. The patch disables the RHWO (Render Hang Workaround Optimization) in the GEN7_COMMON_SLICE_CHICKEN1 register, as recommended in the BSpec Workarounds page.

The patch also includes references to two Bugzilla entries, indicating that the bug has been reported and tracked. Additionally, it has been tested by Eugeni Dodonov and signed-off by Kenneth Graunke and Jesse Barnes.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can cause GPU hangs, and it has been tested and reviewed by relevant individuals.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a build error, as indicated by the reported BUG message and the slab-out-of-bounds error.
2. The bug is reproducible on the Rockchip platform rk3368 SoC, which supports USB 2.0 and uses functionfs for ADB.
3. The bug is triggered when the kernel is built with CONFIG_KASAN=y and CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y, indicating that it affects kernel configurations commonly used for debugging and security.
4. The patch fixes the out-of-bounds access issue by checking if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. This ensures that the descriptor is only accessed when necessary.
5. The patch is signed-off by the original author and another contributor, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering these factors, the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and is not a trivial fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the get_fmt callback function in the m5mols driver. The patch corrects an inverted check of the return value from __find_format().

Since this patch only addresses a typo and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. This BUG_ON statement was causing a regression in the Linux kernel version 3.5, resulting in a kernel crash.

The patch is removing the BUG_ON statement, which was intended to verify that no batches were submitted to the kernel while the UMS/GEM client was suspended. However, the checks performed by the BUG_ON statements are considered a crude approximation and are too late in the code execution to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state.

Considering that the BUG_ON statement is unnecessary and removing it does not introduce any new issues, it can be concluded that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). This will prevent the kernel crash caused by the regression introduced in commit 1b50247a8ddde4af5aaa0e6bc125615372ce6c16.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the Xen pciback driver and the resetting of pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called. The patch aims to avoid resetting pci_dev->irq and mentions that a proper fix will be prepared for the next merging window.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially cause issues with the Xen pciback driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further review and testing may be required to ensure the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to indexing beyond the end of the failed_num[] and fdev[] arrays in the need_this_block() function in the md/raid5 driver. The patch limits the loops to a maximum of 2 iterations to prevent indexing beyond the array bounds.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue, and if it contains any trivial fixes.

Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly mentioned that this patch fixes any of the critical issues mentioned above. However, it does address a potential issue of indexing beyond the array bounds, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue being fixed and whether it qualifies as a critical bug. If this issue is causing data corruption or system instability, it may be considered critical. However, if it is a less severe issue, it may not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Additionally, the patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the available information, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless further information is provided to demonstrate the severity and criticality of the bug being fixed.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a recursive locking bug introduced in the imx_console_write() function.
2. The bug can cause issues with kernel debugging facilities and can potentially lead to being stuck on the lock during a kernel crash.
3. The patch proposes a solution to avoid locking in the sysrq case and use trylock in the oops_in_progress case.
4. The patch also highlights a separate issue related to console writes happening unlocked when port->sysrq is not reset.
5. The proposed solution involves introducing a separate indicator (port->sysrq_cpu) and changing the locking check logic.
6. The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander and signed-off by Thomas Gleixner and Greg Kroah-Hartman.
7. The patch includes the necessary code changes in the imx_console_write() function.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the proposed solution, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases to fix the issue and prevent potential problems with debugging and system stability.

ACK
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The current implementation introduces a race condition where accessing already freed memory can occur when the timer expires again.

2. The bug can potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, as accessing freed memory is undefined behavior and can cause unpredictable results.

3. The patch provides a fix by replacing the problematic mod_timer function with mod_timer_pending, which ensures that the timer is not reactivated if it has already expired.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, which helps in tracking the bug and its resolution.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant developers, indicating that it has undergone a review process.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a resource management issue during suspend/resume in the stmmac driver. The patch aims to address a memory leak by reinitializing descriptors and rx/tx pointers only during resume, instead of freeing and reallocating all resources from scratch.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or hangs. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a functional change rather than a bug fix. The patch adds support for passing probe requests and beacons from other access points (APs) in AP mode and Group Owner (GO) mode. This change is necessary for proper handling of the ht protection IE.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, but rather adds a feature, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm in the TCP implementation. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

The patch modifies the code in the tcp_process_loss function in the tcp_input.c file. It changes the condition for resetting the F-RTO flag (tp->frto) to only reset it if the loss was real (step 3.a). This change ensures that F-RTO probes are not over-sent when the next ACK advances SND_UNA and does not sack new packets.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug fixed by this patch can cause performance issues and longer HoL blocking for applications. Therefore, it can be considered a real and critical bug that affects the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and not containing trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content and purpose.

The patch is reverting a previous commit that prevented unnecessary calls to prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions in the DRM atomic helper code. The revert allows the driver to decide when these functions should be called, rather than handling all the special cases in the core.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the original commit was made to address a specific issue related to waiting in i915 during cursor updates. However, the patch author suggests that there are better ways to fix this issue.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the DRM Radeon driver. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

Since this patch addresses a race condition that can potentially lead to issues during system shutdown or driver unload, it can be considered a critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open.

2. The patch addresses a situation where tp->lsndtime may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

3. If the remote acknowledges both the data and the SYNACK, the RTT sample is already taken in tcp_ack(), so there is no need to call tcp_update_ack_rtt() in tcp_synack_rtt_meas() again.

4. The patch modifies the tcp_synack_rtt_meas() function to take the synack_stamp as a parameter instead of using tp->lsndtime.

5. If synack_stamp is available and there are no total retransmissions, the sequence RTT is calculated as tcp_time_stamp - synack_stamp.

6. If tp->srtt is not set (indicating that the ACK acks both the SYNACK and the Fast Open'd data packets sent in SYN_RECV), the smooth RTT computed in tcp_ack() is used as the SYNACK RTT.

7. The patch also updates the tcp_rcv_state_process() function to pass the synack_stamp to tcp_synack_rtt_meas().

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open and improves the accuracy of the RTT measurement. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

   The patch aims to prevent input-only pins from being set as output for the MPC5121 platform. It adds a reject condition for input-only pins and optimizes the mach-specific quirk setup.

2. Patch Changes:
   - Adds a new function `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` to handle the direction setting for MPC5121 GPIO pins.
   - Checks if the requested GPIO pin is within the range of 28 to 31 (input-only pins for MPC5121). If so, it returns an error.
   - If the requested GPIO pin is not an input-only pin, it calls the existing `mpc8xxx_gpio_dir_out` function to handle the direction setting.
   - Updates the `gc->direction_output` assignment to use the new `mpc5121_gpio_dir_out` function for MPC5121 GPIO compatibility.
   - Updates the `gc->get` assignment to use the `mpc8572_gpio_get` function for MPC8572 GPIO compatibility, or the `mpc8xxx_gpio_get` function for other platforms.
   
3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, the patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to be a functional improvement and a fix for a specific platform's GPIO behavior.

   Since the patch does not address a critical issue and does not introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

   Hence, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug or issue. The changes made in the patch are related to the handling of zero-sized mm in the Nouveau DRM driver. While the patch does add a check for the length of the mm, it does not fix any specific bug or issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to small NVMe-oF queue sizes (<32) causing a potential deadlock due to incomplete IB completions.
2. The error message indicates that the nvme_rdma_post_send function fails with error code -12.
3. The patch modifies the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth rather than using a magic define.
4. It introduces a new function, nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit, to calculate the signaling limit based on the queue size.
5. The patch updates the condition for signaling completion to use the new function and also handles the case of a device with queue_depth=1.
6. The comment in the code suggests that the previous implementation was copied from the iSER initiator and the magic number '32' was also inherited from there.
7. The patch ensures that flushes are always signaled and explains the reason behind it.
8. The patch includes appropriate Cc, Signed-off-by, and Acked-by tags.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to potential deadlocks in NVMe-oF queue handling. It improves the signaling mechanism and removes the reliance on a magic number. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the use of `(HZ / 50)` with `msecs_to_jiffies(20)` in the `schedule_delayed_work()` function call. This change makes the code more explicit about the desired behavior of scheduling the task 20 milliseconds from now.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug introduced by the commit 7d32cdef5356, which caused a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend for the ux500 driver.

2. The bug occurs due to a lacking validation of the corresponding ->driver_data pointer, which won't be set when the musb core driver fails to probe or hasn't been probed yet.

3. The patch adds a check for the musb pointer before calling the usb_phy_set_suspend function in the ux500_suspend and ux500_resume functions.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause a NULL pointer dereference during system suspend. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the DSS clock domain not getting out of idle when HDMI is enabled. The patch includes a temporary hack to ensure the DSS clock domain is enabled before calling pm_runtime_get_sync() for the HDMI platform device.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that can cause HDMI not to work when it's the default display. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to fix a build error in the s3c2410_udc driver. The error is caused by passing the address of `ep->ep.maxpacket` instead of its value to `usb_ep_set_maxpacket_limit()`. The patch corrects this by passing the value directly.

Since this patch fixes a build error, it does not fall under the category of a critical bug, data corruption, security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be a trivial fix related to code correctness.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a crash caused by a general protection fault. The crash is triggered by a use-after-free issue in the blk_exit_rl() function. The patch aims to address this issue by making blk_init_rl() take a reference on struct request_queue.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to interrupt enable code in the cavium-octeon MMC driver. The patch description explains that on certain OCTEON SoCs with CIU3, there is no interrupt masking local to the MMC bus interface, and attempting to store to the enable register can cause interrupts to fire immediately, breaking the driver.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the `octeon_mmc_int_enable` function to only write to the enable register if the `has_ciu3` flag is not set. This ensures that the register is not touched on SoCs where it can cause problems.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause issues with the driver, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the hang of direct I/O read in handling EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN. The patch ensures that the EXT4_IO_END_UNWRITTEN flag is set and the i_aiodio_unwritten counter is increased simultaneously, as ext4_end_io_nolock clears the flag and decreases the counter at the same time.

The patch also includes additional checks to prevent potential future issues and adds the necessary increments to the i_aiodio_unwritten counter when the flag is set.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to prevent a lockdep warning in the __ipoib_ib_dev_flush function in the IB/ipoib driver. The lockdep warning indicates a possible recursive locking scenario, which could potentially lead to a deadlock.

The patch suggests using the down_read_nested function instead of down_read to prevent the warning. It also introduces an additional parameter, nesting, to track the level of nesting in recursive calls.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to a deadlock. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the btrfs file system when read_tree_block() fails. This bug can lead to an oops and potentially impact system stability.

The patch sets the tree_root->node to NULL when read_tree_block() fails, which prevents the subsequent code from triggering the error. This fix addresses the issue and prevents the NULL pointer dereference.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the handling of interrupts in the iwlwifi driver. The bug causes the "trans_pcie->inta" variable to not be properly reset, potentially leading to missed interrupts.

The patch includes a clear description of the bug and how it can impact the system's behavior. It also provides a fix by moving the "spin_unlock_irqrestore" call before resetting the "trans_pcie->inta" variable.

Considering that missed interrupts can lead to various issues, including data corruption or system instability, this patch addresses a real and critical bug. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an uninitialized memory access issue when writing to oprofilefs on the s390 architecture. The patch checks the return value of the oprofilefs_ulong_from_user() function and returns an error if the value is less than or equal to zero.

Considering the patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the sctp_diag.c file in the net/sctp directory.

2. The patch changes the condition in the sctp_ep_dump function. Previously, it checked if the idiag_states flags had any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN and if the endpoint's asocs list was not empty. The patch changes this condition to check if the idiag_states flags do not have the TCPF_LISTEN flag set and if the endpoint's asocs list is not empty.

3. The patch also modifies the condition in the sctp_diag_dump function. Previously, it checked if the idiag_states flags did not have any bits set other than TCPF_LISTEN. The patch changes this condition to check if the idiag_states flags do not have the TCPF_LISTEN or TCPF_CLOSE flags set.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the handling of idiag_states flags in the sctp_diag.c file. It ensures that the TCPF_CLOSE flag is respected when checking the idiag_states flags in both the sctp_ep_dump and sctp_diag_dump functions.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the values of LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2 in include/linux/poison.h. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It is a simple adjustment to the poison pointer values to ensure they fit within the mmap_min_addr range.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description states that the previous fix accidentally modified the loop condition in too many places while fixing a real bug. This indicates that there was a genuine issue that needed to be addressed.

2. The patch correctly fixes the loop condition in the dual_emac mode section, where 'i' is used as an index into priv->slaves, which is a 0-based array. This fix is necessary to ensure correct behavior.

3. The other two changes, which are only used in switch mode, were incorrect in the previous fix. In switch mode, 'i' represents the ALE port number, where port 0 is the host port and ports 1 and up are the slave ports. The patch puts the loop condition back in the switch mode section, addressing the issue.

4. The patch includes comments to clearly explain the intent and avoid future confusion. Additionally, a comment that previously stated the opposite of what was happening has been fixed.

Considering the above points, it appears that this patch fixes a real bug and addresses incorrect behavior in the switch mode section. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a warning generated by GCC. The warning is related to a potential implicit fall-through case in the code. 

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch does not introduce any functional changes or improvements.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the provided information.

The patch description states that it fixes an issue where a syscall, such as the sendto syscall, cannot work correctly because the sock_tx_timestamp() function in packet_snd() does not set the socks.tsflags correctly when the sendto syscall does not have a msg_control buffer.

The patch sets the socks.tsflags to sk->sk_tsflags as the default value to address this issue.

Looking at the code changes, it appears that the patch correctly updates the socks.tsflags value in three different functions: packet_sendmsg_spkt(), tpacket_snd(), and packet_snd().

Based on the provided information and the code changes, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue that can impact the correct functioning of the sendto syscall. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing may be necessary before final acceptance.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to address an issue in the PFMF instruction handler on the s390 architecture. The handler blindly writes the storage key, even if the page is mapped as read-only in the host. The proposed solution is to attempt a copy-on-write (COW) operation before proceeding and bail out in case of errors.

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes start at line 986 and end at line 1006. The key points to note are:
   - A new label "retry" is introduced.
   - The code checks if the page table entry (pte) is valid and has the _PAGE_PROTECT flag set.
   - If the conditions are met, the pte is unmapped and unlocked, and a user fault is fixed by calling "fixup_user_fault".
   - After fixing the fault, the code jumps to the "retry" label to attempt the operation again.

3. Analysis:
   The patch addresses a potential issue where the storage key is written to a read-only page in the host. By attempting a COW operation and fixing user faults, the patch aims to prevent errors and ensure correct behavior.

   Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, let's evaluate:
   - Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, it addresses a potential issue that can lead to incorrect behavior.
   - Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, it can lead to incorrect storage key writes.
   - Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups? No, it introduces significant changes to address the issue.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug. The change in question is a negation of the return value of `ti->type->iterate_devices()` function call. This change does not fix any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` to clear the RWC (Read/Write Clear) bit in the PORTSC (Port Status and Control) register.

2. The function `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` checks if the RWC bit is set in the PORTSC register. If it is set, the function clears the RWC bit and updates the register.

3. The patch modifies the `xhci_bus_resume()` function in `xhci-hub.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC (Port Link Control) bit in the PORTSC register.

4. The patch also modifies the `handle_port_status()` function in `xhci-ring.c` to use the new `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function to clear the PLC bit in the PORTSC register.

5. The patch adds the declaration of the `xhci_test_and_clear_bit()` function in `xhci.h`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to use it. The purpose of the patch is to clear the RWC and PLC bits in the PORTSC register when necessary.

However, the patch does not address any real and critical bugs that cause build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be more of an optimization or cleanup rather than fixing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to address a potential issue with the linear region size of a 39-bit VA kernel on arm64 architecture. The patch sets the MAX_MEMBLOCK_ADDR value to ensure that the memory that cannot be mapped is clipped before being installed into the memblock memory table.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Without further information, it is difficult to assess the severity of the issue being addressed by the patch. However, if the issue is critical and meets the criteria mentioned above, then the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Otherwise, if the issue is not critical or the patch contains trivial fixes, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please provide additional information or context if available to make a more accurate assessment.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to raw sample reading in perf tools. It mentions that the wrong pointer is being passed for raw data sanity checking, leading to an invalid event and causing perf record to hang.

2. The issue can be reproduced with the command `./perf record -e raw_syscalls:sys_enter ls`.

3. The fix proposed in the patch is to use the proper pointer to the raw data instead of the 'u' union.

4. The patch has been reviewed by David Ahern and has received the Reviewed-by tag from him. It also includes several Cc's to relevant individuals.

5. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the LKML mailing list.

6. The patch is signed-off by Jiri Olsa and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.

7. The code changes in the patch are minimal and focused on fixing the specific issue.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause a hang in perf record. It does not contain any trivial fixes and has received positive feedback from a reviewer. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to resetting the HCR (Hypervisor Configuration Register) on each vCPU when resetting the vCPU in the ARM and ARM64 architectures. The patch ensures that the necessary cache maintenance operations are performed when faulting in pages with the guest MMU off, which is crucial for the reboot of VMs.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that can cause issues such as data corruption or hangs, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: "intel_idle: fix API misuse"
   This indicates that the patch aims to fix a misuse of the API in the intel_idle driver.

2. Explanation of the issue:
   The patch explains that the smp_call_function() function is being misused in the intel_idle driver. The expectation is that all CPUs should execute a specific function, but the current implementation only allows other CPUs to execute the function. This can lead to issues where a CPU has auto_demotion enabled or no broadcast timer setup.

3. Impact of the issue:
   The impact of this issue is stated to be minimal, as it usually does not cause any visible problems. However, it can potentially lead to power-related issues and could be problematic in certain scenarios.

4. Patch changes:
   The patch replaces the usage of smp_call_function() with on_each_cpu() to ensure that the specific function is executed on all CPUs. This change is made in two places within the code.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real issue related to API misuse in the intel_idle driver. Although the impact may be minimal, it is still a bug that could potentially cause power-related problems. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its implications may be necessary before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the USB gadget driver. The patch checks if dma_pool_alloc() fails and properly handles the failure by freeing the allocated bd_table before jumping to the fail label. This prevents a memory leak in the case of allocation failure.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that can lead to resource leaks, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem: The kernel hangs during bootup on Little Endian (LE) operating systems when both IMA and VTPM are enabled.

2. Cause: The hang occurs because IMA calls `tpm_pcr_read()`, which triggers the execution of `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` and `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()`. It was observed that `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()` was hanging.

3. Resolution: The patch fixes the hang by addressing the issue in `tpm_ibmtpm_recv()`. The problem was caused by `tpm_ibmvtpm_send()` sending a CRQ message that didn't make sense to phype (Power Hypervisor) due to Endianness. The patch ensures that the CRQ is correctly converted for Little Endian systems.

4. Testing: The patch has been tested with IMA and VTPM enabled in the kernel configuration on both Big Endian (BE) and Little Endian (LE) PowerPC64 LPARs. The testing covered the CRQ and TPM command code paths in the VTPM module.

5. Patch Details: The patch is signed-off by the author and includes appropriate Cc and Reviewed-by tags. It is based on Peter's tpmdd tree on GitHub, which already includes previous Little Endian support patches for the VTPM module.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a hang on Little Endian systems when IMA and VTPM are enabled. It also includes proper testing and has the necessary sign-offs and tags. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference, leading to an oops. The patch sets the drv_data during probe by power_supply_config parameter, ensuring that the property get handler works as desired.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the virmidi driver that can lead to a use-after-free issue in the snd_seq_deliver_single_event() function. The patch plugs the race condition by properly protecting the linked list deletion and calling in the correct order in the snd_virmidi_input_close() function.

Considering that the patch addresses a real bug that can potentially cause data corruption and a use-after-free issue, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to checking the USB speed for the RTL8152 device. The patch replaces the original method of checking the USB speed with a more reliable method using the speed field of the struct usb_device.

The patch itself does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to USB speed detection.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a non-critical bug fix.

Therefore, the answer is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to freezing and thawing of kernel threads during suspend/hibernation, which can lead to memory allocation failures.
2. The patch introduces a modification to the freeze_kernel_threads() function to thaw only kernel threads in case of freezing failure, allowing for additional cleanup before thawing userspace tasks.
3. The suspend_freeze_processes() function is also modified to handle the new behavior of freeze_kernel_threads() and to remove the use of the conditional operator.
4. The patch includes proper documentation and comments explaining the changes made.
5. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple developers, indicating its validity and importance.

Considering the critical nature of the issue being addressed and the proper implementation of the patch, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a lockdep warning about log_mutex in the Btrfs file system.

2. The issue occurs when checking INODE_REF/INODE_EXTREF for a corner case, where a different inode's log_mutex is acquired while holding the current inode's log_mutex, potentially causing a deadlock.

3. The fix involves using mutex_lock_nested() when processing the other inode's log_mutex.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Filipe Manana and Liu Bo.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to potential deadlocks in the Btrfs file system. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue where the source MAC address for frames sent using the VLAN interface is set to the address of the real interface when TX VLAN offload is enabled. This is incorrect because the VLAN interface may have a different address. The bug was introduced in commit 2205369a314e12fcec4781cc73ac9c08fc2b47de.

2. Patch Changes:
   The patch modifies the `vlan_passthru_hard_header` function in the `vlan_dev.c` file. It adds a check to set the source address to the device address if it is currently NULL before calling the create function of the real interface.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description, it appears that the current behavior of setting the source MAC address to the address of the real interface when TX VLAN offload is enabled is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect addressing when the VLAN interface is configured with a different address. The patch addresses this issue by setting the correct source address before calling the create function of the real interface.

   Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause incorrect addressing and potential data corruption, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on the analysis, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to incorrect source MAC address handling when TX VLAN offload is enabled.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the codebase would be necessary for a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the bonding driver that can cause an assertion failure and potentially lead to system instability. The patch replaces the use of rtnl locking with RCU primitives to address the issue.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential memory leak issue in the lightnvm driver. The patch adds a new function `gennvm_free` that frees allocated memory blocks and lun structures when the `gennvm_register` function fails. It also calls this new function in the error handling path of the `gennvm_register` and `gennvm_unregister` functions.

Since this patch addresses a potential memory leak, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds an additional check to avoid overflow in msg-type 6 requests in the s390/zcrypt driver.

2. The patch modifies the XCRB_msg_to_type6CPRB_msgX function in the zcrypt_msgtype6.c file.

3. It introduces three new variables: replylen, req_sumlen, and resp_sumlen.

4. The patch adds an overflow check for the request sum length. It ensures that the sum is greater than or equal to the largest operand.

5. It also adds an overflow check for the reply sum length, following the same logic as the request sum length check.

6. If either the request or reply sum length is found to be invalid, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an error.

7. The patch then prepares the type6 header and continues with the rest of the function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential overflow issue in the s390/zcrypt driver. It adds necessary checks to prevent data corruption or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "weak" attribute from the clocksource_default_clock() declaration. This change ensures that a non-weak definition is always preferred over the weak one, regardless of link order.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error check in the staging driver for the IIO accelerometer (sca3000). The patch checks for a negative return value from the function sca3000_read_ctrl_reg() instead of just checking for a non-zero value.

Since this patch addresses an error check and ensures proper handling of failure cases, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a regression introduced in commit 6e3f62f0793e. The patch aims to partially revert the mentioned commit to address the issue of platform-device name collisions in mfd-drivers.

However, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a compatibility issue between the old behavior and the new behavior introduced by the commit.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the MPX instruction decoder in the x86 architecture.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description explains that the function `send_leave` sets the `group->query_id` member after calling `sa_query`, but `leave_handler` can be executed before the setting, potentially deleting the `group` object and causing memory corruption. This is a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption.

2. The patch also mentions that the `group->query_id` variable is not used, so removing it does not affect the functionality of the code.

3. The patch includes the necessary `Fixes` tag, referencing the commit that introduced the bug.

4. The code changes in the patch remove the assignment of `ret` to `group->query_id` in both `send_join` and `send_leave` functions. Instead, it returns 0 if `ret` is greater than 0, indicating a successful query, and returns `ret` otherwise. This change ensures that the `group->query_id` is not accessed after potential memory corruption.

Based on these points, the patch addresses a real and critical bug, removes an unused variable, and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. Description of the problem:
   The patch addresses a bug that can be reproduced by running kvm-unit-tests/vmx.flat on L0 with VPID disabled. It results in an unhandled exception 6 #UD at a specific instruction pointer.

2. Proposed solution:
   The patch aims to hide and forbid VPID in L1 if it is disabled on L0. Currently, the nested VPID enable bit is set unconditionally during the setup of nested vmx exec controls, even though VPID is not exposed through nested VMX capability. The patch fixes this by not setting the nested VPID enable bit if it is disabled on L0.

3. Impact and significance:
   The bug addressed by the patch causes an unhandled exception, which indicates a critical issue. The proposed solution ensures that the VPID is correctly handled in nested virtualization scenarios, preventing the exception from occurring.

4. Code changes:
   The patch modifies the `nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs` function in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c`. It removes the `SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VPID` flag from the `SECONDARY_EXEC` bitmask and adds a conditional check to set the `SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_VPID` flag only if VPID is enabled on L0.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that causes an unhandled exception and provides a necessary fix to handle VPID correctly in nested virtualization scenarios.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the thunder-pem driver in the PCI subsystem. It fixes a problem where reserving the full 16M range for PEM-specific resources causes a failure in the child device driver when the pcieport driver requests resources.

The patch modifies the code to reserve only the PEM-specific register, which has a size of SZ_64K. This change ensures that the child device driver does not encounter the failure mentioned earlier.

Additionally, the patch increases the PEM resource size back to SZ_16M at the end, as it is expected by the thunder_pem_init() call for proper initialization.

The patch also includes a fix for reserving the PCI configuration space.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause device driver failures and is not a trivial fix. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that could lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a rounding error in the calculation of the `limits->max_policy_pct` value in the `intel_pstate_set_policy` function of the `intel_pstate.c` file in the `cpufreq` driver. The rounding error causes the CPU frequency to be set lower than expected.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a rounding error that affects the CPU frequency calculation, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any "trivial" fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It introduces a functional change by adding the `DIV_ROUND_UP` macro to correctly round up the `limits->max_policy_pct` value.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a functional issue and does not contain any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to reading off the end of a packet when collecting TCP flags in the openvswitch module. This issue could result in reading bad data, but it is unlikely to cause a crash due to the presence of struct skb_shared_info at the end of the packet.

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a warning generated by some versions of GCC. The warning is related to an array subscript being above array bounds in the eicon driver code.

The patch modifies the code by open-coding the PUT_WORD() macro, which is causing the warning, and replaces it with direct assignments to the array elements. The new code assigns the lower 8 bits of LI_REQ_SILENT_UPDATE to the second element and the upper 8 bits to the third element of the structs array.

Since this patch only addresses a warning and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug that causes divides by zero errors in the __tcp_select_window() function. The bug occurs when inet_csk_route_child_sock() returns a NULL pointer, leading to freeing a new socket while the keepalive timer is still armed in tcp_create_openreq_child().

The patch proposes a fix by calling tcp_clear_xmit_timers() before unlocking the socket and freeing it. This action ensures that the xmit timers are properly cleared before the socket is released.

Considering that this bug can potentially lead to errors and issues, such as divides by zero and freeing a socket with an armed timer, it can be classified as a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix error handling in the udc_pci_probe() function in the amd5536udc driver.

Please provide more information about the bug and the impact it has on the system, so I can make an accurate assessment.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a call to the function `nfs4_ds_disconnect()` in the `filelayout_async_handle_error()` function. The reason for removing this call is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` after the call, which could result in a NULL pointer dereference and an Oops.

The patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid the issue by invalidating the device ID instead.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to determine the severity or criticality of the bug. However, based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference and an Oops.

Considering the potential impact and the fact that the patch is removing code rather than introducing new code, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is always recommended to thoroughly test the patch and consider any potential side effects before applying it to a stable release.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to running the offline self-test in the ixgbe driver.

2. The current behavior of calling `dev_close()` in the offline self-test causes `IFF_UP` to be cleared, which removes interface routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent with bringing down the interface before the test.

3. The proposed solution suggests calling the `ndo_stop` function directly from `net_device_ops` instead of using `dev_close()`. This avoids touching `IFF_UP` altogether.

4. The patch includes changes to the `ixgbe_open()` and `ixgbe_close()` functions in `ixgbe_main.c`, which are used to handle the interface being brought up or down.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a real issue related to the offline self-test behavior in the ixgbe driver. It avoids an inconsistent behavior and potential data loss by calling `ndo_stop` directly instead of using `dev_close()`. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in an oops.
2. The bug is caused by an incorrect implementation in the workingset shadow nodes shrinker, which becomes memcg aware.
3. The patch fixes the issue by checking the sc->memcg variable instead of using memcg_kmem_enabled().
4. The fix has been tested and reported by Marek Marczykowski-Górecki.
5. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple developers, including Vladimir Davydov, Johannes Weiner, and Balbir Singh.
6. The patch is also marked as a stable fix for versions 4.6 and above.
7. The patch is signed-off by the original author and other relevant developers.

Considering all these factors, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch increases the maximum number of properties from 16 to 24 in the DRM subsystem. The reason for this change is to address a situation where on i915 machines with many TV connectors, the maximum number of properties is reached, resulting in backtraces in the logs.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a limitation related to the number of properties in the DRM subsystem.

Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a non-trivial fix, as it involves changing a constant value in the code.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is suggesting to revert a deprecation warning related to SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP socket implementation. The reasons given for reverting the warning include the fact that SCTP_SNDRCV is part of the user API (uapi) and therefore cannot be changed, the need for SCTP applications to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support, and the potential impact on users who are unable to change their applications.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It appears to be more of an improvement or a change in behavior rather than a fix for a critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not seem to introduce any trivial fixes.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "be2net: release mcc-lock in a failure case in be_cmd_notify_wait()". It suggests that the mcc/mbox lock is not being released when be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the be_cmd_notify_wait() function in the be_cmds.c file. It adds a new label "unlock" and a "goto" statement to release the lock in case be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

3. Analysis: The patch addresses a potential issue where the mcc/mbox lock is not released when be_cmd_copy() returns an error. Failing to release the lock can lead to resource leaks and potential deadlocks. Therefore, this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause issues like hangs or resource exhaustion.

4. Trivial Fixes: The patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the critical bug.

Based on the analysis, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses an off-by-two bug in the "perf hists browser" tool. The bug causes misalignment in the normal output. 

Since this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues, and it is a trivial fix, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to the configuration of the direct_irq_en bit for pads using io mode in the pinctrl-baytrail driver. The patch forces the clearing of this bit and triggers a warning if it is misconfigured.

Considering that this patch addresses a potential misconfiguration that can lead to the io based irq not being detected, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the size of a variable-length array from using the "len" variable to a fixed size of 65. The patch does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix that falls under the category of a spelling change or whitespace cleanup.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is disabling the use of shadow registers in the iwlwifi driver by default due to reliability issues causing host command timeouts. The patch sets the `shadow_reg_enable` parameter to `false` for various iwlwifi devices.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical issue that can cause communication problems and host command timeouts. Therefore, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch is fixing a build error caused by a previous commit (03fbf488cece) that removed the "LPSS_SSP" type without considering its usage in this file.

2. The removal of the incorrect binding is a necessary fix to resolve the build error.

3. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the issue.

4. It has been reported by Axel Lin and signed-off by Jarkko Nikula, who is a recognized contributor.

5. The patch is also marked for stable inclusion (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), indicating that it is suitable for backporting to stable kernel releases.

6. The change is limited to removing the incorrect binding, which is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, the patch addresses a real and critical bug (build error) and meets the criteria for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, it should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced by commit 05cc5a39ddb7 in the bnx2x driver. The regression causes a null pointer dereference when loading the 8021q module on machines with 57710 or 57711 adapters. The patch adds a check for the specific chip type (chip_is_e1x) to correctly set the accept_any_vlan flag.

Given that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to a null pointer dereference, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to make dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() iterate only over IN endpoints that are actually present, based on the num_in_eps parameter. This prevents dereferencing a potential NULL dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

2. The patch modifies the loop condition from "num < DWC3_ENDPOINTS_NUM" to "num < dwc->num_in_eps". This ensures that the loop only iterates over the valid IN endpoints.

3. The patch also changes the calculation of the endpoint index from "struct dwc3_ep *dep = dwc->eps[num]" to "struct dwc3_ep *dep = dwc->eps[(num << 1) | 1]". This calculation uses the bit0 of the endpoint number to determine the direction, where 1 means IN endpoint.

4. The patch removes the check for dep->number & 1 and continues the loop if the condition is not met. This check was previously used to skip non-IN endpoints, but it is no longer necessary with the new calculation.

5. The patch updates the FIFO size calculation and the write to the FIFO size register to use the endpoint index "num" instead of "fifo_number".

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to iterating over IN endpoints and prevents potential NULL dereferences. It does not seem to be a trivial fix as it involves changes to the loop condition, endpoint index calculation, and FIFO size calculation.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or system instability.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a critical bug that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the SCTP module. This bug can lead to a kernel panic and is triggered by a malformed INIT ping-of-death packet. The patch addresses the issue by checking for a NULL return value from the sctp_get_af_specific() function before dereferencing the pointer.

Considering that the bug can lead to a kernel panic and the patch fixes a real and critical issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to accessing ctl_table in the proc_sys_poll() function. The bug can occur if poll() is called in entries created by modules and the user calls poll() in a file that doesn't support it. The patch adds protection by grabbing the header with grab_header() and releasing it with sysctl_head_finish().

The bug was reported by Dave Jones and the patch is signed-off by Lucas De Marchi, Andrew Morton, and Eric W. Biederman. It also includes relevant Cc's and is marked for stable@vger.kernel.org.

Considering the patch addresses a real bug that can potentially cause issues during hibernation/resuming, and it does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to enable the CPUID for Intel Secure Hash Algorithm Extensions, specifically for SHA1/SHA256 instruction extensions. It adds the X86_FEATURE_SHA_NI definition to the cpufeature.h file.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the provided patch does not mention any bug or issue that it resolves. It seems to be adding support for a new feature.

Since the patch does not fix a critical bug or address any significant issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, based on the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that improves the error message in the l2c310_of_parse() function in the cache-l2x0.c file. The patch changes the error message from "PL310 OF: cache setting yield illegal associativity" to "L2C-310 OF cache associativity %d invalid, only 8 or 16 permitted". 

Since this patch only modifies the error message and does not fix a real and critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to setting the IRQ thread policy without checking CAP_SYS_NICE. The patch replaces the use of sched_setscheduler() with sched_setscheduler_nocheck() to omit the CAP_SYS_NICE check for the SCHED_OTHER policy.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug?
   - Yes, the patch addresses an issue where the IRQ thread may not run with the SCHED_OTHER policy if the user does not have CAP_SYS_NICE.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The bug does not seem to cause any of the mentioned issues directly. However, it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the IRQ thread does not run with the intended policy.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes. It addresses a specific issue related to setting the IRQ thread policy.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to the IRQ thread policy. However, it is important to note that further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

2. It updates the syscall number after each PTRACE_SETREGS on ORIG_*AX.
3. This fix is necessary to get the potentially altered syscall number in the seccomp filters after RET_TRACE.
4. The patch addresses four failing seccomp_bpf tests related to syscall numbers.
5. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the issue.
6. The patch is signed-off by Mickaël Salaün and Acked-by Kees Cook.
7. It is also CC'd to several relevant individuals.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to syscall number updates after ptrace. It addresses failing tests and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the dma_mmap() function in the ARM IOMMU-based dma-mapping implementation. The patch adds a missing range check for mmap parameters, specifically the offset and buffer size, to prevent access beyond the allocated buffer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to access beyond the allocated buffer, which falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug related to size updates for asynchronous I/O (AIO) writes in the NFS (Network File System) module.

2. The patch addresses an issue where the inode size is not updated correctly when nfs_file_direct_write is called for AIO writes and nfs_direct_wait returns -EIOCBQUEUED.

3. The patch introduces a new function called nfs_direct_complete, which is called from nfs_direct_wait and nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec.

4. The nfs_direct_complete function updates the inode size if the operation is a write and the size needs to be increased.

5. The patch also modifies the calls to nfs_direct_complete in nfs_direct_read_completion, nfs_direct_read_schedule_iovec, nfs_direct_write_schedule_work, and nfs_direct_write_complete to pass the appropriate write flag.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to size updates for AIO writes in the NFS module. It addresses a specific issue and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The WRITE_SAME commands are not present in the blk_default_cmd_filter write_ok list, causing them to fail with -EPERM when the SG_IO ioctl() is executed without CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

2. The problem can be reproduced and observed with the sg_write_same command, which fails with "Operation not permitted" when executed by unprivileged users.

3. The patch adds the WRITE_SAME commands to the write_ok list, allowing the SG_IO ioctl to finish successfully.

4. The issue is observed in QEMU KVM guests with 'scsi-block' devices, which use the SG_IO ioctl and run as unprivileged users. This scenario is relevant and affects real-world usage.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original reporter and reviewers.

6. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to data corruption and affects real-world usage scenarios. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a critical bug that can lead to a null-pointer dereference and a kernel panic. The patch cancels pending work for each unit in sbp2_remove(), ensuring that there are no extra references preventing the module from unloading.

Considering that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a kernel panic, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch fixes a specific issue related to the incorrect re-injection of STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) packets in the bridge code. The issue arises when the bridge device re-injects packets to the Rx path with skb->dev set to the bridge device itself, which breaks the kernel's STP functionality.

The patch addresses this issue by learning the packet's source MAC address (SMAC) and injecting it back to the Rx path for further processing by the packet handlers. Additionally, the patch ensures consistent behavior for packets destined to the Bridge Group Address, regardless of whether STP is enabled or not.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix provided, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can potentially cause issues with STP functionality in the kernel's bridge code.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493) that caused problems on GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link.

2. The patch is signed-off by Giuseppe Cavallaro <peppe.cavallaro@st.com> and has several Cc's.

3. In the stmmac_mdio_register() function, the patch modifies the code to check for a compatible child node ("snps,dwmac-mdio") within the device's of_node. If found, it sets the mdio_node variable accordingly.

4. In the stmmac_probe_config_dt() function, the patch removes the code that searches for a child node with the "snps,dwmac-mdio" compatibility string and assigns it to the plat->mdio_node variable.

5. In the plat_stmmacenet_data structure definition in stmmac.h, the patch removes the mdio_node variable.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch reverts a commit that caused issues with specific boards when connected to a real transceiver. The changes made in the patch seem reasonable and targeted at fixing the specific problem. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing a test for an uninitialized DRBG (Deterministic Random Bit Generator) cipher handle in the drbg_healthcheck_sanity() function. The patch just removes the test and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the PCI config address for DDW (Dynamic DMA Window) in the powerpc/pseries architecture. The patch modifies the calculation of the cfg_addr variable to correctly represent the PCI config address format required by the firmware.

The patch includes a "Fixes" tag referencing the commit that introduced the issue and a "Cc" tag for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it should be considered for inclusion in stable releases.

Given that the patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it seems appropriate to accept it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error on sparc64 caused by missing exported symbols in the mc13xxx-regulator-core.c file. The patch exports the symbols "mc13xxx_get_num_regulators_dt" and "mc13xxx_parse_regulators_dt" to resolve the build failure.

Since the patch addresses a real bug that causes a build error, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the build error and whether it meets the criteria for a critical bug. Additionally, the patch does not seem to address any other issues like oops, hang, data corruption, or security concerns.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases unless there is additional context or evidence that the build error is critical and meets the required criteria.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to MTU probing in TCP repair. The patch initializes MTU probing when setting the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) in a TCP repair. This ensures that MTU probing is not stuck at the tcp_base_mss value until tcp_probe_interval seconds have passed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a specific behavior related to MTU probing in TCP repair.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes some variables from `unsigned int` to `size_t`. This change is aimed at enabling 64-bit arithmetic for very large files. However, it does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue in the UDF (Universal Disk Format) filesystem. The patch limits the maximum number of indirect extents that can be followed in a row to prevent potential infinite loops and handle corrupted filesystems. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or filesystem corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the discard_granularity in the DM thinp driver. The patch ensures that the discard_granularity is set to the maximum value between the underlying data device's discard_granularity and the thin-pool's block size.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and improves the alignment of discards, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The mvsas driver is causing a General Protection Fault when encountering an expander attached ATA device. This issue can lead to system instability and potential data corruption.

2. The analysis explains the root cause of the bug: The driver assumes all ATA devices are locally attached and obtains the phy mask by indexing the local phy table. However, expanders have more phys than the HBA, causing an index overflow and returning incorrect data.

3. The patch proposes a fix: It suggests mirroring the approach used in mvs_task_prep_ssp() for obtaining the phy mask using the port properties in mvs_task_prep_ata(). This fix aims to prevent the panic caused by the index overflow.

4. The patch includes relevant information: It provides the reported-by and tested-by tags, indicating that the bug has been identified and verified by Adam Talbot. It also includes the signed-off-by tag from James Bottomley, indicating his approval of the patch.

Considering the critical nature of the bug, the proposed fix, and the provided information, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the restoration of BARs in Type 0 configuration headers. The patch modifies the behavior of the `pci_restore_config_space()` function to only retry the restoration of BARs for Type 0 config headers.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a specific bug, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption or other issues. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a critical bug related to the programming of the CSMSADRCFG register in the ARM PXA3xx platform. The patch ensures that the register is correctly programmed to 0x2, which is necessary for the correct behavior of the Static Memory Controller.

The patch also addresses the issue where devices wired to DFI and accessed through SMC cannot be accessed after resuming from S2. By programming the CSMSADRCFG register in the kernel smemc module instead of relying on the bootloader, this issue is resolved.

Considering the nature of the bug and the importance of correctly programming the CSMSADRCFG register, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical issue that can cause data corruption and impacts the functionality of devices after resuming from S2. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not take into account any other factors or dependencies.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the restoration of UCB1x00 gpio output data on resume. This bug could potentially lead to incorrect GPIO output data after a resume. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could cause incorrect behavior in the system. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch allows RSM (Resume from System Management Mode) from 64-bit mode, even though the Software Developer's Manual (SDM) states that it is invalid. This suggests that the patch is introducing a behavior that is not officially supported.

2. The patch includes code to support exiting from compatibility mode (EFER.LME=1, EFER.LMA=0) and transitioning from 64-bit mode to real mode by clearing CS.L and CR4.PCIDE.

3. The patch checks if the vCPU supports long mode and performs additional steps to handle the transition from 64-bit mode to real mode.

4. The patch clears CR0/CR3/CR4/EFER to prepare a safe state for loading new values.

5. It clears CR4.PAE if it is set.

6. Finally, it sets MSR_EFER to 0 to clear EFER.LMA.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing a non-standard behavior by allowing RSM from 64-bit mode. While the patch includes necessary steps to handle the transition, it is unclear why this behavior is being introduced and whether it addresses a real and critical bug or issue.

Without more context or information about the bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. However, based on the information provided, it seems more appropriate to classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the madvise_free_huge_pmd function in the mm/huge_memory.c file. The patch ensures that the fallback PTE operations are correctly executed after splitting a Transparent Huge Page (THP) if necessary.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or correctness improvement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the PCI versatile host bridge driver. The bug causes the PCI IO resource to be considered valid even if the kernel fails to map the PCI host bridge memory address driving IO cycles to the CPU virtual address space.

The patch addresses this issue by destroying the PCI host bridge PCI IO resources retrieved through firmware when the pci_remap_iospace() function call fails. This prevents the kernel from adding the respective PCI IO resource to the list of valid resources, thereby fixing the problem.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to incorrect resource assignment and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the handling of the last register block in the specified range. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of registers that should be synced, resulting in either syncing too few or too many registers.

The patch correctly adjusts the calculation formula to ensure the correct number of registers are synced. It subtracts the number of the first register in the block from the maximum register number and adds one.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that can potentially lead to incorrect synchronization of registers, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the powerpc specific nx-842 compression driver. The patch adds a routine to properly handle translating a vmalloc address to a physical address, which is currently not handled correctly.

3. The patch ensures that the UDC is stopped after the gadget driver is unbound, preventing potential issues related to the NULL driver argument.

4. The patch also ensures that the sysfs attribute file attached to the gadget is removed before the UDC is deleted, which aligns with the correct order of operations.

5. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and CC to the stable mailing list, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch fixes real and critical bugs and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the data type of two variables from 'u32' to 'int'. This change does not fix a real and critical bug, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issues.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to transmission failure on a Sierra Wireless MC7710 device. The patch modifies the cdc_mbim_info structure by adding the FLAG_SEND_ZLP flag.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a specific issue related to a particular device.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression in the pinctrl-abx500 driver related to Device Tree (DT) initialization. The patch modifies the probe() function to extract a platform ID from Device Tree if it cannot be sourced from platform data. It also removes unnecessary checks for platform data and adjusts the logic for determining the platform ID.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real issue that could cause the driver to fail when DT is enabled. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch enables the vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the `mixer_wait_for_vblank` function.

2. It ensures that the `wait_vsync_event` atomic variable is cleared by expecting the upcoming vsync interrupt handler routine to do so.

3. The patch enables and disables interrupts properly to ensure the expected behavior.

4. It calls `drm_vblank_get` to increment the vblank reference count for the specified CRTC device and pipe.

5. It sets the `wait_vsync_event` atomic variable to 1.

6. The patch waits for the `wait_vsync_event` atomic variable to be cleared, with a timeout of HZ/20 (one-twentieth of a second).

7. If the wait times out, it prints a debug message indicating that the vblank wait timed out.

8. Finally, it calls `drm_vblank_put` to decrement the vblank reference count for the specified CRTC device and pipe.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to vsync interrupt handling and waiting for vblank. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to dropping the voltage to Vmin when the Gfx is power gated for the latest VLV revision. The patch drops a workaround that is no longer needed for the latest VLV revision and instead requests the minimum frequency to bring the voltage Vnn.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a critical bug related to data corruption. The patch ensures that the timestamp is set as the last element in the channel specification, which is necessary for correct interpretation of the data by userspace code.

Given that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch description states that it is safer to turn on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator in the wm8962 driver. This is because the driver will turn off the regcache_cache_only after enabling the regulator. If cache_only remains false, certain commands like 'amixer cset' may fail if run before wm8962_resume().

2. Code Changes:
   The code changes in the patch involve adding the line "regcache_cache_only(wm8962->regmap, true);" before the call to "regulator_bulk_disable" in the wm8962_i2c_probe function.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and code changes, it appears that this patch addresses a potential issue related to the order of operations when disabling the regulator in the wm8962 driver. By turning on regcache_cache_only before disabling the regulator, it ensures that certain commands will not fail when executed before wm8962_resume().

   This patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it does address an issue that could potentially lead to failures in certain commands.

4. Conclusion:
   Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements for a critical bug fix. It appears to be more of an improvement or a non-trivial fix rather than fixing a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces the usage of `exit(-1)` with `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` in the `hv_kvp_daemon.c` file. This change is made to align with Linux native exit codes and does not fix any real or critical bug.

Since the patch does not address any significant issue and only involves a trivial fix, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to a general protection fault (GPF) in the `flush_to_ldisc()` function. The previous commit already addressed the issue for line disciplines that do not define a `receive_buf()` method. However, this patch aims to fix the same problem in the `tty_ldisc_receive_buf()` function, which is used by the vt driver and speakup driver to push selection data directly to the line discipline's `receive_buf()` method.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a critical bug that could potentially lead to a GPF, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real issue that could cause system instability or crashes. Additionally, it does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug in the ocfs2_file_aio_write() function in the ocfs2 file system. The bug causes a lock to be left held if ocfs2_inode_lock() fails, which can lead to issues in ocfs2_lock_res_free().

Considering the nature of the bug and the potential impact on data integrity and system stability, it seems like a real and critical issue. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch aims to make the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) L2 header check more generic, as it currently assumes an Ethernet header size of 14 bytes. The reported issue is that the current implementation fails on IB/ipoib (InfiniBand over IP) traffic.

The proposed solution is to take into account the `hard_header_len` field of the `skb->dev` structure, which represents the length of the L2 header. If `hard_header_len` is equal to `ETH_HLEN` (Ethernet header length), the existing optimized inline function `compare_ether_header` is used. Otherwise, a `memcmp` call is made to compare the L2 headers.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's why:

1. It fixes a real and critical bug: The current GRO L2 header check fails on IB/ipoib traffic, which can lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption.

2. It addresses a specific issue: The patch provides a solution to the reported problem by making the L2 header check more generic, taking into account the actual header length.

3. It does not contain trivial fixes: The patch introduces a significant change to the L2 header check logic, which is not a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

4. It has been reviewed and tested: The patch has been reviewed by multiple individuals, including the original reporter and other kernel developers. It has also been tested and verified by Sean Hefty.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a mis-merge in gmap handling for the s390 architecture. The commit message explains that some changes were dropped during a previous merge, which caused KVM to fail for certain memory sizes, specifically 2GB.

The patch itself modifies the gmap_map_segment function by adjusting the condition for checking the maximum address range. It changes the comparison from "from + len > TASK_MAX_SIZE" to "from + len - 1 > TASK_MAX_SIZE" and similarly for "to + len - 1 > gmap->asce_end". This change ensures that the address range does not exceed the maximum allowed size.

Based on the information provided, it seems that this patch addresses a real bug that can cause KVM to fail for specific memory sizes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to power management in the AMDGPU driver. The bug causes conflicts with port power management and prevents the dGPU from powering on. The patch fixes this issue by correctly enabling the legacy power management method.

The patch also includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit that introduced the bug. It is also reported and tested by Mike Lothian and signed-off by Peter Wu and Alex Deucher.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that caused booting issues on a custom AT91RM9200 board. The issue was related to incorrect boundary checks when reusing static mapping in the ioremap function.

The patch includes a detailed explanation of the problem and provides evidence that the original fix was incorrect. It also includes an Acked-by tag from Nicolas Pitre, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by him.

Considering the critical nature of the issue and the evidence provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that caused booting problems on a specific board, and it reverts a previous incorrect fix.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to make dropped packets consume the NAPI budget in the octeon-ethernet staging driver. This is done to ensure that the NAPI handler does not run for an extended period.

2. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `cvm_oct_napi_poll` function in the `ethernet-rx.c` file. It adds an increment to the `rx_count` variable when packets are dropped. It also removes an existing increment to `rx_count` when a packet is received but dropped due to the device not being up.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to dropped packets and the NAPI handler. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity and impact of the issue being fixed.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, any potential risks associated with the patch, and whether it has been tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers.

Please provide more context or information about the bug being fixed and any relevant discussions or testing that has taken place.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential lost wakeup scenario in the staging driver "quatech_usb2" when using the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl. The patch addresses a race condition between the qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status.

The patch introduces a barrier() to ensure memory ordering, sets the current task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and uses __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING) to mark the task as running when returning from the loop.

Considering the patch addresses a potential issue that could result in a lost wakeup scenario, it can be categorized as fixing an "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to improve PM runtime and phy handling for the 2430 glue layer in the musb driver.

2. It simplifies the code by allowing idling both MUSB and PHY when nothing is configured, returning early from PM runtime if musb is not yet initialized.

3. It adds a warning if the PHY is not configured.

4. The patch initializes the PHY in the omap2430_musb_init() function.

5. It enables runtime PM for the musb parent driver in the omap2430_musb_init() function.

6. The patch powers on the PHY in the omap2430_musb_enable() function.

7. It sets the power for the musb and handles the status in the omap2430_musb_enable() function.

8. The patch powers off the PHY in the omap2430_musb_disable() function.

9. It handles the status and control mode in the omap2430_musb_disable() function.

10. The patch performs cleanup and exits in the omap2430_musb_exit() function.

11. It cancels the mailbox work and unregisters the platform device in the omap2430_remove() function.

12. The patch performs runtime suspend in the omap2430_runtime_suspend() function.

13. It performs runtime resume in the omap2430_runtime_resume() function.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to improve the power management and PHY handling for the 2430 glue layer in the musb driver. It does not seem to fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the VCE ring test on Big-Endian systems. The patch ensures that every write to the ring is translated to little-endian. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address an issue specific to Big-Endian systems, which may not be considered a critical bug affecting a wide range of users.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) not to be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to the generation of random numbers for the mmap_base address. The patch introduces a new function called get_random_long() which operates similarly to get_random_int() but returns an unsigned long value. It also fixes the shifting constant in mmap_rnd() to handle values greater than 31 bits appropriately.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it appears to be an improvement or optimization related to random number generation.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to calling xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice on a V4 superblock, which leads to setting both pquotino and gquotino to NULLFSINO. This behavior is not desirable and can cause issues.

2. The patch fixes the issue by making it safe to call xfs_sb_quota_from_disk twice and removes the extra calls to libxfs_sb_quota_from_disk.

3. The issue is only observed when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because the behavior exists on a V4 superblock, and the sb_from_disk change came after V5 became the default.

4. The patch has been reported by Eryu Guan and reviewed by Carlos Maiolino, providing additional validation.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption. It does not contain any trivial fixes and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the irq_domain_add() function. The existing sanity check in this function tests whether the irq_data pointer is not NULL or if irq_data->domain is not NULL. This check prevents adding an irq_domain to an irq descriptor when irq_data already exists.

However, the patch splits the check for irq_data == NULL into a separate warning. This allows for a more specific warning when the irq_data pointer is NULL, indicating an error in assigning the domain to a non-existent irq_desc.

The patch also retains the check for irq_data->domain, which ensures that the irq_desc is not already assigned to a domain. If this check fails, a warning is issued.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential issue in the irq_domain_add() function by providing more accurate warnings for different scenarios. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or errors.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a temporary fix for an infinite loop issue in the Exynos DRM driver when using a multi-platform kernel. The patch checks if the machine is compatible with specific Exynos SoC versions and only registers the Exynos DRM device object in those cases.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a workaround for a specific issue related to multi-platform support.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses two audio bugs in the hdpvr driver, which can be considered real and critical issues.
2. The first bug causes the audio input to be changed incorrectly when the audio encoding is modified. This bug has always been present.
3. The second bug was introduced in kernel 3.10 and affects the handling of the default_audio_input module option. It prevents the audio encoding from switching to AC3 when default_audio_input is set to 2 (SPDIF input).
4. The patch also fixes a trivial typo in the code (bufffer -> buffer).
5. The patch is signed-off by the relevant developers and includes proper attribution for the bug report.
6. The patch is also marked for consideration in stable releases (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org).

Given that the patch addresses real bugs, includes a fix for a regression introduced in a specific kernel version, and has the necessary sign-offs and attribution, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch aims to fix an issue where the trace_marker file adds the trace mark to the global trace buffer instead of the instance's buffer.

2. Impact: This issue does not seem to cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. However, it can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue as it affects the functionality of the trace_marker file.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the `tracing_mark_write` function in the `kernel/trace/trace.c` file. It adds a new line to assign the `tr` variable to the `filp->private_data` field, which represents the trace array instance. It then replaces the usage of the global trace buffer with the instance's buffer.

4. Analysis: The patch appears to address the specific issue described in the patch description. It correctly assigns the instance's buffer to the `buffer` variable, ensuring that the trace mark is added to the correct buffer.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix since it does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before making a final decision.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch and evaluate if they meet the criteria for acceptance.

The patch aims to avoid a duplicate call to the function `iscsit_increment_maxcmdsn()` for `ISER_IB_RDMA_WRITE` within the functions `isert_map_rdma()` and `isert_reg_rdma_frwr()`. It is mentioned that this call is already occurring once during the `isert_put_datain()` -> `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` operation.

Additionally, the patch removes the assignment and increment of the local variable `cmd->stat_sn` and changes the third parameter of `iscsit_build_rsp_pdu()` to signal that it should be done by the `iscsi_target_mode` code.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the changes made by the patch do not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be optimizing and removing redundant code.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a performance improvement for the render backends in the DRM Radeon driver. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. 

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to releasing the controller's lock during gadget resume in the USB DWC3 driver. This bug could potentially lead to issues such as hangs or data corruption. 

Considering the patch meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the `of_get_display_timings()` function in the `drivers/video/of_display_timing.c` file. The patch adds a `kfree(dt)` statement to free the memory allocated for `dt` in case `of_parse_display_timing()` fails.

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is a revert of a previous commit that claimed throughput improvement for MSC/UVC but did not show significant improvement in measurements. Additionally, the patch introduces regressions, such as breaking the ASIX usb-ethernet dongle on UDP RX and causing console log flooding with error messages when unplugging a 3G modem.

Considering that the patch reverts a commit that did not provide the expected improvement and introduces regressions, it is likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression introduced in the previous fix commit. The regression caused a bug in rfkill notification to user-space. The patch restores the functionality by resetting the firmware after rfkill is turned off.

Since this patch addresses a regression and fixes a critical bug that affects the functionality of rfkill notification, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to grabbing crtc mutexes during intel_modeset_setup_hw_state() when the pipe A force quirk is applied. This can lead to a deadlock if all crtc mutexes are already held.

2. Instead of using drm_modeset_lock_all(), the patch suggests grabbing the mode_config.mutex, which is sufficient to avoid the unlocked mutex warnings from lower-level functions.

3. The patch includes information about the regression introduced in a specific commit, along with the author and date of the commit.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author and also includes a cc: stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it is intended for stable releases.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to potential deadlocks and provides a targeted fix. It does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xmon data-breakpoint feature in the powerpc architecture. The bug causes the hw_breakpoint_handler to not notify xmon when a watchpoint match occurs.

The patch modifies the hw_breakpoint_handler function to return NOTIFY_DONE instead of NOTIFY_STOP when no associated perf_event is found for the matched watchpoint. This change ensures that the xmon breakpoint handler is properly called.

Considering that the patch addresses a real bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock in the IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) subsystem when overlayfs is used. The bug is reported by Krisztian Litkey and the patch is signed-off by Miklos Szeredi.

The patch modifies the code in the ima_appraise_measurement() and ima_update_xattr() functions in the ima_appraise.c file, as well as the process_measurement() function in the ima_main.c file.

The patch replaces the usage of file->f_path.dentry with the file_dentry() function, which is a helper function that returns the dentry associated with the file. This change ensures that the correct dentry is used when calling ->setxattr() on overlayfs, preventing the deadlock.

Considering that the patch addresses a real bug that can lead to a deadlock, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the IPv6 code related to the allocation of ICMPv6 destination entries. The bug was causing crashes in the mld_sendpack() function. The patch adds an error handling path to return an error pointer (-ENODEV) when the idev variable is not available.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can cause crashes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a critical bug that causes a crash during booting on the netwinder platform. The crash is caused by overlapping PCI mappings introduced by a previous commit. Deleting the hunk related to the overlapping PCI mappings resolves the issue and allows the system to boot up fine with all PCI devices working.

Given that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a problem caused by commit b685d3d65ac7, which removed the REQ_SYNC flag from WRITE_{FUA|PREFLUSH|...} definitions. This removal can lead to performance regressions when the storage doesn't report volatile write cache.

2. The patch fixes the problem by ensuring that all bios marked as synchronous are properly labeled with the REQ_SYNC flag.

3. The changes made in the patch are in the fs/btrfs/disk-io.c file.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to performance regressions and ensures that bios marked as synchronous are correctly labeled.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a behavior in the iio dummy driver related to event processing. The patch changes the return value of the IRQ handler from `IRQ_HANDLED` to `IRQ_WAKE_THREAD`. 

Without further context, it is difficult to determine whether this patch addresses a real and critical bug or if it falls under the category of a "trivial" fix. To make an informed decision, I would need more information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is intended to fix.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer at this time. Please provide additional details or context about the bug or issue being addressed by this patch.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the hpsa driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a missing call to pci_set_master() in the kdump path, which was previously overlooked in the "hpsa: refine the pci enable/disable handling" patch.

Since this patch addresses a missing function call, it does not fall under the category of trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Additionally, it does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a build error when DDW (64-bit direct DMA on Power) is not enabled for NVMe devices, leading to a fallback to 32-bit DMA via the IOMMU. This can result in a BUG_ON condition in nvme_setup_prps().

2. The patch fixes the bug by defaulting the NVMe device page size to 4K, which matches the IOMMU's page size. This ensures that the DMA alignment for PRP entries matches the device's page size and the kernel's page alignment.

3. The patch includes a stop-gap fix to address the functional issue until an API and implementation for obtaining the IOMMU's page size across all architectures can be added in the next merge window.

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that attempted to fix a reported issue with the "capacity_now" value being higher than the "full_charge_capacity" value when the battery is fully charged.

2. The patch author argues that it is not unexpected for "capacity_now" to increase above "full_charge_capacity" due to variations in charging cycles and battery firmware behavior. Good battery firmwares may update "full_charge_capacity" when the current charging cycle is complete, even increasing it if necessary.

3. The patch claims that capping "capacity_now" to "full_charge_capacity" is incorrect and that printing a warning if they don't match the "design_capacity" is both annoying and wrong.

4. The reported issue causes bogus warnings on perfectly working systems/firmwares and incorrect values being reported for "capacity_now" and "full_charge_capacity" after the warning is triggered.

5. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a previous commit that introduced the issue.

6. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Bjørn Mork and Rafael J. Wysocki.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved.

Based on these factors, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to modify the behavior of acpi_find_child_device() in the ACPI/scan module. Currently, if there are multiple devices with the same _ADR value in the same namespace scope, the first one found to be present is returned. However, this approach does not consider cases where some devices have a _HID or _CID returning valid ACPI/PNP device IDs, which is not allowed by the specification.

The patch suggests modifying find_child_checks() to prioritize devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change aims to match devices without valid device IDs against a given bus address first.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific case where the current behavior does not comply with the ACPI specification. It does not fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Therefore, this patch can be considered a "trivial" fix.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, which exclude "trivial" fixes, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

3. The patch restores the original behavior of freeing the notifiers pointer on qos->resume_latency, which is used.
4. It fixes the kmemleak warning related to an unreferenced object.
5. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the issue.
6. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch fixes a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the usbvision driver. The patch checks the number of endpoints before accessing the endpoint array to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer or accessing memory beyond the endpoint array.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `enable_lock` spinlock from the `imx-tve` driver in the Linux kernel. The patch explains that the `enable_lock` is unnecessary because DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions. Additionally, holding a spinlock while calling `clk_prepare_enable()` is incorrect and can cause a warning if debugging is enabled.

Considering the information provided, it seems that the patch is removing unnecessary code and fixing potential issues. However, without further context or knowledge of the specific bug or issue being addressed, it is difficult to determine if the patch meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to review the bug report or issue that this patch is addressing and assess its severity and impact on the system. Additionally, it would be helpful to consider the opinions of other kernel developers who have reviewed and acknowledged the patch.

Therefore, without more information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to using a stack-allocated buffer for DMA in the stk_camera_read_reg() function of the stk-webcam driver. The patch allocates a buffer using kmalloc() and uses it for the USB control message, ensuring that the buffer is in a DMA-enabled area. After the control message, the buffer is freed using kfree().

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential issue related to DMA, which could be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

2. The patch fixes both issues by moving the call to `rpc_clone_client()` after `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` has completed its operations.

3. The patch includes a `Reported-by` tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Andy Adamson.

4. The patch is signed-off by Trond Myklebust, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue related to memory leaks and improves the code by simplifying it.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch aims to improve SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) balancing by avoiding select_idle_sibling() from picking a sibling thread if there is an idle core that shares cache. It addresses the common case where there is a shared cache core available for balancing.

Looking at the changes made in the patch, it seems to be fixing a specific issue related to SMT balancing. However, it does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for setting queue limits for the admin queue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a new helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets the device-specific queue limits for the admin queue. This ensures that the command size on the admin queue is not arbitrarily low and applies the necessary limitations.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Reported-by, Tested-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.

Considering the patch addresses a specific issue related to queue limits and improves the functionality of the NVMe driver, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 platforms. The patch description explains that using the dummy clock with a rate of zero can lead to misconfigured timings and devices being lost on the bus.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical issue that can cause misconfigurations and device loss. It does not appear to be a trivial fix like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for defining and using an explicit "CONNECTED" state in the libceph module. The patch adds the CONNECTED state and updates the relevant code to set and clear this state appropriately.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. It falls under the category of a code cleanup or improvement rather than addressing a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the USB gadget serial driver. The patch adds a check for the 'port->port_usb' pointer before accessing it to avoid the crash.

Since this patch addresses a potential crash, it can be considered a fix for a critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue reported by Coverity related to the allocation size in the watchdog core. The patch correctly updates the allocation size from `sizeof(*wdd)` to `sizeof(*rcwdd)`.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug reported by Coverity and fixes a potential issue with allocation size, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a real bug: The patch addresses a bug where the function `intel_check_page_flip()` generates lots of warnings when called in soft-IRQ context due to the use of `in_irq()`.

2. The bug can cause warnings: The bug can lead to warnings being generated, indicating a potential issue in the code.

3. The patch improves context checking: The patch replaces the use of `in_irq()` with `in_interrupt()`, which allows for either type of interrupt context. This change ensures that the page flip code is not misused when called from non-interrupt context.

4. Bugzilla reference: The patch includes a reference to the Bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321), indicating that the bug has been reported and tracked.

5. Reviewed and signed-off: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter.

6. Relevant mailing list: The patch has been sent to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in the stable releases.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use the stored max_vddc value instead of looking it up manually each time when parsing the power tables in the DRM Radeon driver.

2. The patch removes the variable 'vddc' from the ni_parse_pplib_clock_info() and rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info() functions.

3. Instead of calling radeon_atom_get_max_vddc() to look up the max_vddc value, the patch checks if pi->max_vddc is non-zero and assigns it to pl->vddc if pl->vddc is 0xff01.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is making a code improvement by using the stored max_vddc value instead of repeatedly looking it up. It does not fix a critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be trivial in nature, as they involve removing a variable and replacing a function call with a simple assignment.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable, causing the device to not wake up for important events.

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a critical bug related to the manipulation of the FDT (Flattened Device Tree) in AArch64 UEFI implementations. It explains that some firmware disables the MMU (Memory Management Unit) in the ExitBootServices() function, which leads to unaligned accesses to RAM not being supported. This can result in alignment faults when manipulating the FDT with the MMU off.

The patch proposes a fix by moving the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that the FDT manipulation occurs in a better place and avoids alignment faults caused by the disabled MMU.

The patch also mentions that disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices() is not compliant with the UEFI spec and carries great risk due to the unsafe switching from cached to uncached memory accesses halfway through compiler-generated code.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it appears that this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical issue that can lead to data corruption and aligns with the goal of maintaining stability and security in the Linux kernel.

Therefore, the decision is (A) to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a bug related to the `fs_info->pending_changes` variable in the Btrfs file system. The original code uses `cmpxchg` to clear the variable, but it only clears it if `pending_changes` is already 0. This can cause problems when mounting Btrfs with the `inode_cache` mount option, as `pending_changes` will always be 1 even when the file system is frozen.

The patch replaces the `cmpxchg` call with `xchg` to ensure that `pending_changes` is always cleared. This fix seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or hangs.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - No, the patch introduces a functional change by adding a check to skip certain attributes.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). While it may not address a critical issue causing immediate crashes or data corruption, it prevents potential issues and ensures correct behavior when accessing PWM fan control attributes without DPM enabled.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix the WARNING "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" that is triggered during unloading the block driver.

2. The patch removes the call to `blk_mq_freeze_queue(q)` before deleting the tag set. This is because the queue has already been frozen by `blk_cleanup_queue()` before the tag set deletion, so there is no need to freeze it again.

3. The patch also removes the call to `blk_mq_unfreeze_queue(q)` after deleting the tag set. Since the queue is already being freed, there is no need to unfreeze it.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to the "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" warning during block driver unloading. The changes made in the patch seem reasonable and do not introduce any trivial fixes.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to clock rate setting in the mxs-mmc driver. The bug causes incorrect clock rate calculation, resulting in a significantly lower actual clock rate than expected. This issue can be easily reproduced on mx23evk with high-speed SDIO cards.

The patch modifies the mxs_mmc_set_clk_rate() function to correctly calculate the clock rate and divide values. It introduces the variables clock_divide and clock_rate to replace the previous div1 and div2 variables. The clock_divide value is calculated based on the SSP clock rate and the requested rate, while the clock_rate value is derived from the clock_divide value. The patch also updates the register values accordingly.

The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect clock rate settings, potentially causing performance issues or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. Reported-by and Tested-by: The issue was reported and tested by András Murányi.

4. Patch details: The patch modifies the code to correctly retrieve the enable_ext and enable_word values by using the correct IDs (9 and 8) for the Selector Function Blocks.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a failure to open the PCM device in Terratec Phase 88. The issue is reported and tested, and the patch addresses the incorrect assignment of IDs for the Selector Function Blocks.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the information provided.

The patch is a revert of a previous commit that allowed PCH PWM override on IVB (Ivy Bridge) in the drm/i915 driver. The reason for the revert is that it breaks the backlight controls on an IVB Asus Zenbook with an eDP panel.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the original commit introduced a bug that affects the functionality of the backlight controls on specific hardware. This can be considered a real and critical bug as it impacts the usability of the affected devices.

Considering that the patch reverts the problematic commit, it can be seen as a fix for the issue. However, it is important to note that the patch does not provide an alternative solution or address the underlying problem. The comment suggests that the proper fix would involve reading a specific bit and using either the PCH or CPU register to adjust the backlight values, but that is planned for future development.

Given the nature of the issue and the fact that the patch reverts a problematic commit, it can be considered a valid fix for the immediate problem. However, it does not address the root cause or provide a complete solution. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as a temporary fix until a more comprehensive solution is implemented in the future.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a missing unlock on the error handle path in the `net2272_irq()` function in the `net2272.c` file of the USB gadget driver. 

Since this patch addresses a potential issue related to locking and unlocking, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix, as it only adds a missing unlock statement. As per the criteria mentioned earlier, patches with trivial fixes should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Hence, my decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue in the memremap's helper function try_ram_remap(). It mentions that there is an assumption that there is a 1:1 relation between the System RAM iomem region and the kernel direct mapping, which is not universally valid on all architectures, specifically ARM and arm64.

2. The patch proposes adding a check to ensure that pfn_valid() returns true before calling pfn_to_page() and __va() functions. This check ensures that these functions are only called on PFNs/physical addresses for which pfn_valid() returns true.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue where the assumption of a 1:1 relation between System RAM and the kernel direct mapping is not valid on certain architectures. By adding the check for pfn_valid(), the patch ensures that the functions are only called on valid PFNs/physical addresses, preventing potential issues.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough analysis would require reviewing the code changes and considering any potential side effects or interactions with other parts of the kernel.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the provided information.

The patch aims to fix an issue related to the MACB/GEM driver in the Linux kernel. It addresses the need to initialize the checksum field to 0 for correct transmit results in all cases. Specifically, it mentions that on Zynq, UDP packets with a payload size less than or equal to 2 contain incorrect checksums.

The patch introduces a new function called `macb_clear_csum` which is responsible for initializing the checksum field in the SKB (socket buffer) structure. It checks if the packet has checksum offloading enabled and if the SKB header can be modified. If these conditions are met, it initializes the checksum field to 0.

In the `macb_start_xmit` function, the `macb_clear_csum` function is called before mapping the socket buffer for DMA transfer. If the `macb_clear_csum` function fails, the SKB is freed and the transmission is considered successful.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real issue related to incorrect checksums in UDP packets on Zynq. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new function and modifies the `macb_start_xmit` function.

Considering the nature of the issue and the changes made by the patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, and it does not contain any trivial fixes.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing may be necessary before final acceptance.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug where the code enabling the clock was removed from the probe function when the PM initialization was moved in a previous commit.
2. On CONFIG_PM=y kernels, this is not an issue as the pm resume hook enables the clock. However, when power management is disabled (CONFIG_PM=n), the clock is never enabled, resulting in a dysfunctional gpio controller.
3. The patch puts back the clock initialization to support CONFIG_PM=n.
4. The patch includes a Fixes tag, referencing the commit that caused the issue.
5. The patch also includes a Signed-off-by tag from the author and the maintainer.
6. The patch enables the clock using the clk_prepare_enable() function and checks for any errors.
7. It sets the device as active and enables runtime PM.
8. It gets the runtime PM sync and checks for any errors.
9. If there is an error, it cleans up and returns the error code.
10. If there are no errors, it disables runtime PM and disables and unprepares the clock.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug that can cause a dysfunctional gpio controller when power management is disabled. It does not contain any trivial fixes and includes the necessary tags and error handling.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an incorrect OOM (Out of Memory) return value and also improves error path handling for clarity. However, it does not address any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. Additionally, it contains some "trivial" fixes such as returning early on error paths and changing a return value from "goto out_err" to "return ret".

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for Microsoft Surface docks that use the Realtek RTL8152 chip. This patch adds the necessary USB device IDs for the Microsoft Surface 2 dock and Microsoft Surface 3 dock.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to false lockdep warnings in the ALSA PCM core. The patch addresses the problem by passing the lock subclass calculated from the depth in `snd_pcm_action_group()` and dropping a potentially incorrect lock subclass set in `snd_pcm_action_lock_mutex()`.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug related to lockdep warnings, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. It does not seem to contain any trivial changes such as spelling or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the ftdi_sio driver for USB serial devices. The patch ensures that short responses are properly detected when reading the latency timer, preventing the use of stale buffer data.

The patch also includes a fix for a potential heap data leak through sysfs, although it mentions that this is not currently an issue due to a default setting.

Considering the nature of the patch, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a more minor issue related to error handling and potential heap data leaks.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the I2C bus number for the IGEP's DVI connector. This change does not fix a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing a call to `ieee80211_recalc_min_chandef()` in the `rate_control_rate_init()` function in the `rate.c` file of the `mac80211` module. The patch is fixing a context bug by removing the call, but it mentions that a different way to fix the minimum channel width issue needs to be found.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch is addressing a context bug and removing a call that cannot be made in certain situations. However, it does not explicitly mention any real and critical bug or issue that it fixes. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug being addressed.

Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless additional information is provided to demonstrate the criticality and impact of the bug being fixed.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug in the gpio/omap driver related to enabling and disabling interrupts. The patch adds the capability to disable interrupts based on the "enable" parameter, which was previously not used.

Since this patch addresses a real bug and improves the functionality of the driver, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to module reference counting in the intel_th driver. The patch adds a missing module_put() call in the activation error path, which prevents a reference leak and allows the module to unload properly.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a potential reference leak, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a reported issue by Florian Westphal, stating that the removal of the NOTRACK target is breaking some existing setups. This indicates a real and critical bug that needs to be fixed.

2. The removal of the NOTRACK target was scheduled for removal a long time ago, as mentioned in the feature-removal-schedule.txt file. However, some users may not have noticed or decided to stick to an old iptables version.

3. The patch recovers the NOTRACK target inside the CT target and adds a warning message to inform users about its deprecation. This approach provides a more conservative solution by allowing users to upgrade at their own pace.

4. The patch includes changes in multiple files, including net/netfilter/xt_NOTRACK.c, include/net/netns/x_tables.h, net/netfilter/Kconfig, and net/netfilter/xt_CT.c. These changes indicate that the patch is not a trivial fix but rather addresses the core issue.

5. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Florian Westphal, and a "Signed-off-by" tag, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by Pablo Neira Ayuso.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for a new PEBS frontend profiling event for the Skylake architecture. This patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it introduces a new feature.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria for acceptance.

The patch appears to address a specific issue related to association hangs in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation. It modifies the sctp_ulpq_renege_list() function in the net/sctp/ulpqueue.c file.

The changes made in the patch include:
1. Introducing variables `last_tsn`, `flist`, and `last` to handle events with multiple fragments.
2. Summing the total freed space and finding the last TSN (Transmission Sequence Number) for events in the ordering queue.
3. Unlinking the event and renege all applicable TSNs.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if the bug being fixed is critical or if it causes any of the specified issues (build error, oops, hang, data corruption, security issue, or "oh, that's not good" issue). Additionally, there is no explicit mention of any security vulnerability being addressed.

Without further context or information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. However, based on the provided information, it seems more likely that this patch may not meet the criteria for acceptance in -stable releases. Therefore, my initial recommendation would be to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch author, Stefan Kriwanek, has tested the patch to ensure it does not interfere with the proper working of bug-free devices.

3. The patch includes the necessary copyright information and is signed-off by the author and Jiri Kosina.

4. The code changes in the patch address the "jumpy" cursor issue caused by invalid events sent by the device. The patch adds a condition to drop events with a value greater than or equal to 256, which is restrictive enough not to interfere with bug-free devices.

5. The patch also drops useless distance 0 events, further improving the behavior of the driver.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that affects the Speedlink VAD Cezanne model. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should be accepted (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a locking issue in the s5p-fimc driver's subdev set_crop operation. The bug causes the mutex to be erroneously acquired instead of released on the exit path. This bug has been present since kernel version 3.2.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch addresses an issue with zero padding of the last 64-bit word in the push buffer.
2. It corrects the arithmetic for zero padding by using `pdata + length` to reach the end.
3. It replaces the usage of `pdata` with `end` in the `PTR_ALIGN()` function to ensure the aligned pointer - 1 is the last 64-bit pointer to data.
4. The patch is signed-off by Michael Chan and David S. Miller.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to zero padding in the bnxt_en driver. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting arithmetic and pointer alignment. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the InfiniBand SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) driver. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. Patch Title: "IB/srp: Avoid sending a task management function needlessly"
   - The patch title suggests that it aims to optimize the task management function in the SRP driver to avoid unnecessary sending.
   - This does not indicate any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue.

2. Code Changes:
   - The patch adds a check before sending a task management function in the `srp_send_tsk_mgmt` function.
   - If the target is not connected or the QP (Queue Pair) is in an error state, the function returns -1, indicating that the task management function should not be sent.
   - This change ensures that the task management function is not sent needlessly when it would fail anyway.

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The change seems to be a performance optimization rather than fixing a critical bug or security issue.
   - It does not introduce any new risks or regressions.

Based on the analysis, this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug: The patch is fixing a bug related to the capability check in net_ctl_permissions(). The bug caused confusion for application authors, and the patch aims to prevent this confusion.

2. The bug does not indicate a security violation: The patch clarifies that the capability check is used to determine inode permissions and does not indicate a violation of security policy. Therefore, the denial audit message generated by the LSM was unnecessary.

3. The patch improves clarity and usability: By switching to the noaudit variant of the capability check, the patch prevents confusion for application authors, specifically mentioning root-running Go applications triggering the denial.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Tyler Hicks, Serge E. Hallyn, James Morris, Dmitry Torokhov, and David S. Miller, indicating that it has undergone peer review and received approval from multiple experts.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation update for the Nouveau DRM driver in the Linux kernel. It adds a description for the error code 0x10, "INVALID_ADDR_SPACE," which occurs when attempting to use an atomic operation on local or shared memory instead of global memory.

Since this patch is purely a documentation update and does not fix any real or critical bug, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the virtio_net driver's RX (receive) path. The race condition occurs when virtqueue_enable_cq is called after napi_complete, violating the synchronization requirement with virtqueue_add_buf. This can lead to lost interrupts and potential panics.

The patch proposes a fix by calling virtqueue_enable_cb_prepare with NAPI_STATE_SCHED set under the napi lock and later calling virtqueue_poll with NAPI_STATE_SCHED clear outside the lock.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and potential panics, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes some NFSv4.1 OPEN requests to hang while waiting for the NFS server to finish recalling delegations. This is a significant issue that affects the functionality of the NFSv4.1 protocol.

2. The bug leads to data corruption: The patch mentions that each NFSv4.1 CB request on RDMA gets a GARBAGE_ARGS reply from the Linux client. This indicates that the bug can result in data corruption.

3. The patch fixes the issue: The patch adds a line in the `rpcrdma_bc_receive_call()` function to initialize `rq_private_buf.len`. This initialization was missing, causing `svc_process_common()` to be invoked with a zero-length RPC message and fail. By fixing this initialization, the bug is resolved.

4. The patch is not a trivial fix: The patch addresses a specific issue related to the handling of RPC messages in the `rpcrdma_bc_receive_call()` function. It does not contain any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the decision is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a possible deadlock issue in dm-bufio, which can occur with large block sizes.
2. The issue is caused by the allocation of kernel pagetables, which always use GFP_KERNEL, potentially leading to a deadlock.
3. The patch introduces the use of memalloc_noio_save and memalloc_noio_restore functions to set and restore the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag, respectively.
4. By setting the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag, all allocations in the process are done with the implied GFP_NOIO flag, preventing the deadlock from occurring.
5. The patch also mentions that for stable kernels, which lack the PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag and related functions, the PF_MEMALLOC flag should be set and restored instead.
6. The patch is signed-off by the relevant contributors and is suggested for backporting to stable kernels.

Given that the patch addresses a potential deadlock issue and provides a solution that can be applied to stable kernels, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to the register for the ramp delay of the buck1 regulator in the S2MPA01 regulator driver.

2. The issue is described as using the incorrect register and field for the ramp delay of buck1, which resulted in the ramp delay of buck3 being updated instead of buck1.

3. The patch correctly identifies the issue and fixes it by using the correct register and field for the ramp delay of buck1.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.

5. The patch is signed-off by the author and reviewed by other contributors.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to incorrect ramp delay settings for the buck1 regulator. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) driver. The patch correctly frees the `disk_conf` structure, which was previously not being freed, resulting in a memory leak of 336 bytes for each attach/detach cycle.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that can cause memory leaks, it should be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a warning message triggered by the stop_other_cpus() function during system reboot on certain 24 CPU Westmere servers. The warning message is caused by a delay in sending NMIs to all other CPUs, which can trigger a timer interrupt and result in a warning in native_smp_send_reschedule().

The patch proposes disabling the local IRQ before calling stop_other_cpus() to prevent the timer interrupt from triggering scheduler's load balance and causing the warning. The patch has been tested successfully multiple times.

Considering that this patch fixes a real issue that can cause a warning message during system reboot, and it does not appear to contain any trivial fixes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch description: The patch fixes wrong mapping flags for free space inode in the Btrfs filesystem.

2. Reported-by and Tested-by: The patch was reported and tested by Merlijn Wajer, indicating that the issue was identified and verified by a third party.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Filipe Manana and Chris Mason, indicating their approval and responsibility for the patch.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the __lookup_free_space_inode function in the fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c file.

   a. Line 86: The patch changes the mapping flags for the inode's mapping. It updates the flags to ~(GFP_NOFS & ~__GFP_HIGHMEM) to ~(__GFP_FS | __GFP_HIGHMEM).

5. Analysis: The patch addresses a specific issue in the Btrfs filesystem where incorrect mapping flags were causing problems on an ARM machine, rendering Btrfs unusable. The patch fixes this issue by correctly setting the mapping flags.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes Btrfs to be unusable on ARM machines. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its purpose and changes.

The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may not match the panel's preferred mode due to incomplete initialization. It replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if their resolutions don't match. This change ensures that the panel's preferred mode accurately represents the panel's capabilities.

Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` function in the `radeon_connectors.c` file. It introduces a loop that iterates over the probed modes of the connector and checks if any mode has the `DRM_MODE_TYPE_PREFERRED` flag set. If a preferred mode is found and its resolution doesn't match the native mode, the native mode is replaced with the preferred mode.

Based on the provided information, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It appears to address a corner case where the BIOS native mode may not match the panel's preferred mode. While it may improve compatibility in certain scenarios, it does not fall under the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the handling of zero checksums in UDP packets. The patch replaces the zero checksum with 0xffff, regardless of the transport protocol.

This issue can potentially lead to data corruption and security vulnerabilities, as UDPv6 receivers should drop frames with a zero checksum, and UDPv4 might accept corrupted packets without verifying the checksum.

Considering the severity of the issue and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and potential security issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the calculation of dirtyable memory in the Linux kernel's page writeback mechanism. The patch aims to exclude anonymous pages (anon/tmpfs) from the calculation, as they should not be considered when determining the amount of dirtyable memory.

The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Johannes Weiner, Tejun Heo, Rik van Riel, Michal Hocko, and Andrew Morton. It also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags.

Considering the nature of the issue being addressed and the positive reviews and testing, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real problem related to memory management and can potentially improve system performance and stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix two regressions in the nouveau driver caused by changes in the move_notify function. The first regression is related to the incorrect handling of new_mem and bo->mem, which can lead to accessing stale memory. The second regression involves passing TTM ghost objects to the driver, causing uninitialized memory access.

The patch reverts the change that caused the first regression and introduces a cleanup in the move() failure path. It also adds a check in nouveau_bo_move_ntfy() to ensure that only objects created by nouveau are processed. Additionally, it modifies ttm_bo_handle_move_mem() to handle the move_notify() call in case of an error.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses real and critical bugs that can lead to data corruption and potentially security issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the sk_uid member of struct sock could be set to a "garbage" value from the stack. The patch addresses this by only copying the uid over when ATTR_UID is set in ia_valid.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems. It is not a trivial fix as it addresses a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch converts the irq_reg_{readl,writel} calls to the new API, which was modified in the commit "genirq: Generic chip: Change irq_reg_{readl,writel} arguments".

2. Context: The arch/arm/plat-orion/gpio.c file received a fix for a certain sequence of request_irq that can cause an irq storm. This commit aims to fix the use of the old API in this file.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch is signed-off by Gregory CLEMENT <gregory.clement@free-electrons.com> and Acked-by Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>.

4. Link: The patch has a link to the original message on the LKML mailing list.

5. Code Changes: The patch modifies the orion_gpio_unmask_irq and orion_gpio_mask_irq functions in the arch/arm/plat-orion/gpio.c file.

6. Analysis: The patch updates the calls to irq_reg_readl and irq_reg_writel functions by passing the gc and ct->regs.mask arguments. This aligns with the changes made in the generic chip API.

1. Patch description: The patch aims to fix the "failed to lookup clock node gmac_gmii_ref_clk_div" boot message by preventing the creation of a clk alias for a non-existing clock.

2. Fixes tag: The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit c097338ebd3f that addresses the clocks tree issue in the ARM DTS (Device Tree Source) for the dra7 platform.

3. Signed-off-by: The patch includes two Signed-off-by lines, indicating that Grygorii Strashko and Stephen Boyd have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. Code changes: The patch removes the "gmac_gmii_ref_clk_div" clock entry from the dra7xx_clks array in the clk-7xx.c file.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real issue related to clock lookup during boot and is supported by the Fixes tag and the approval of two reviewers.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The issue described in the patch causes a double-lock to occur while holding the write lock, resulting in a locked-up file system and corrupted mode.

2. The bug can lead to a hang and data corruption: The patch mentions that the file system becomes completely locked up, and the corrupted mode is not written out.

3. The patch fixes a specific problem related to chowning setuid files with xattrs: It modifies the reiserfs_chown_xattrs() function to temporarily clear everything but ATTR_UID|ATTR_GID for the calls to reiserfs_setattr. It also adds the missing IS_PRIVATE check in reiserfs_acl_chmod.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: It addresses a real issue and introduces changes to the code logic.

Considering these factors, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent potential hangs and data corruption.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch reverts a previous commit that fixed a warning message in the acpi_battery_get_state() function.
2. The reason for reverting is that capping the 'capacity_now' to 'full_charge_capacity' is considered incorrect. It may work around buggy firmware but should not be applied to working firmwares without protection.
3. Good battery firmwares allow 'capacity_now' to increase above 'full_charge_capacity' and update the latter when the battery is fully charged. Capping 'capacity_now' results in inaccurate capacity reporting until charging is complete.
4. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag to reference the commit being reverted.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Bjørn Mork and Rafael J. Wysocki.

Based on this analysis, the patch addresses a real issue related to battery capacity reporting and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix lockups on boot," indicating that it addresses a critical issue causing system lockups during boot.

2. The patch is a fix for a regression introduced in a previous commit, which attempted to fix the lockup issue but had logic errors that prevented affected systems from booting.

3. The original cause of the problem is unknown, as none of the developers have systems affected by it.

4. The patch includes the "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the regression, indicating that it is intended to resolve the issue caused by that commit.

5. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the changes.

6. The patch modifies the code in the affected files to address the issue, specifically correcting a logic error in the `rtl8821ae_enable_interrupt` function.

7. The patch also includes a modification to the module parameter description, clarifying the default value for `int_clear` parameter.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug causing system lockups on boot. It does not contain any trivial fixes and is signed-off by the relevant contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for preventing stacking filesystems (ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using procfs as the lower filesystem. The patch adds a comment explaining the reason for not allowing stacking on top of procfs and sets the s_stack_depth field to FILESYSTEM_MAX_STACK_DEPTH.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a design decision and potential issues related to stacking filesystems on top of procfs.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue related to output polling during device suspension in the radeon DRM driver. The patch disables output polling during suspend and re-enables it during resume. 

Since the patch addresses a potential problem that could lead to erroneous status updates, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch description states that there is an issue where SSN (Slave Select Negation) should be kept LOW during processing 1 command/data series, but it becomes HIGH instead. The patch aims to fix this issue.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that a new constant `SSN_HIGH` is added, which is set to `0x03U`.

3. In the `pch_spi_set_ir` function, the code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is removed. This means that the control over SSN is no longer explicitly set to "no control" after waiting for the transfer to complete.

4. In the `pch_spi_start_transfer` function, the same code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is also removed.

5. In the `pch_spi_process_messages` function, the code that writes `SSN_NO_CONTROL` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is added before starting the message processing loop. Additionally, after the loop, the code that writes `SSN_HIGH` to `PCH_SSNXCR` register is added.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses the issue where SSN becomes HIGH instead of staying LOW during processing. The changes made to the code seem to be relevant and necessary to fix the issue.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is fixing a reported issue of RCU stall warnings, which were bisected back to a specific commit.
2. The commit being fixed inadvertently reversed the calls to schedule() and signal_pending(), causing a problem when a signal is received while sleeping.
3. The issue was reported and tested by Vladimir Murzin.
4. The patch is signed-off by Peter Zijlstra (Intel) and Ingo Molnar.
5. It includes several Cc's to relevant individuals and fixes two specific commits.
6. The patch modifies the bit_wait(), bit_wait_io(), bit_wait_timeout(), and bit_wait_io_timeout() functions in the kernel/sched/wait.c file.
7. In each of these functions, the patch checks if a signal is pending before calling the respective scheduling functions (schedule(), io_schedule(), schedule_timeout(), and io_schedule_timeout()).
8. If a signal is pending, the functions return -EINTR to indicate interruption.
9. The patch is fixing a real issue related to signal handling during waiting operations.

Based on this analysis, I would say that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug related to signal handling, which can lead to potential issues such as RCU stall warnings.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the initialization of a spin lock in the AMD XGBE network driver. The patch correctly updates the spin lock initialization by using the proper pointer.

Since this patch addresses a bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or instability in the network driver, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The bug causes a failure in the generic/263 test on XFS due to xfs_get_blocks() mapping a single extent that spans EOF without marking it as buffer-new(). This leads to incorrect behavior in direct IO, potentially overwriting valid data with zeros.

2. The patch provides a fix for the bug: It detects a mapping that spans EOF and truncates it down to EOF. This ensures that the direct IO code behaves correctly for unaligned data blocks before EOF and correctly marks the mapping for blocks beyond EOF as buffer-new.

3. The patch has been reviewed and tested: It has been reviewed by Eric Sandeen and Christoph Hellwig, and tested by Brian Foster. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a significant issue and does not include trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug in XFS.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where requests may get lost if a stopped queue restarts before the requests are added to the dispatch list. This issue could lead to data corruption or other problems. Therefore, this patch addresses a potential "oh, that's not good" issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug related to stream and datagram sockets in the llc_ui_recvmsg() function. The bug causes the msg_namelen member to not be updated to 0, which can lead to leaking uninitialized kernel stack memory to userland.

The patch addresses this issue by setting msg_namelen to 0 early in the function. This ensures that the uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable is not leaked to userland. The patch seems to be a targeted fix for a specific issue and does not contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption and potential security issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the cdc-acm driver. The patch adds a call to kfree() to free the memory allocated for acm->country_codes in the error case when probe() fails.

2. The bug was introduced in the v3.7-rc1 patch, and it was reported by Kelsey Prantis from Intel.

3. The patch re-adds the missing memset() function to zero the bounce buffer memory before copying it into the outgoing se_cmd descriptor kmapped SGL payload.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Cc tags for proper attribution and communication.

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the fact that the patch directly addresses the regression, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical issue related to a DMA mapping error in the stmmac driver. The patch adds a missing spin_unlock call to release the tx_lock in case of a DMA mapping error. This is important to prevent potential hangs or data corruption.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to propagate the error code from failing to unregister a conflicting fb driver to avoid kernel panics.
2. The function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` is modified to return an integer value instead of being void.
3. The variable `ret` is introduced to store the return value of `do_unregister_framebuffer`.
4. If `do_unregister_framebuffer` fails, the function `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` will return the error code.
5. The function `do_register_framebuffer` now calls `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and returns the error code if it fails.
6. The function `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` is modified to return an integer value instead of being void.
7. The function `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` now calls `do_remove_conflicting_framebuffers` and returns the error code if it fails.
8. The header file `include/linux/fb.h` is modified to reflect the changes in the function signatures.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch is introducing error code propagation and handling for the removal of conflicting fb drivers. This is a necessary fix to avoid potential kernel panics. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference issue when loading the cx88_dvb module for a Hauppauge HVR4000. The patch checks whether the module was actually loaded, which is a safer approach. The patch also mentions that the driver is buggy when it comes to unloading and reloading modules.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, it seems like a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as crashes or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical issue related to memory allocation for RTAS (Run-Time Abstraction Services) on powerpc architecture. The patch introduces a panic mechanism if the memory allocation for RTAS fails, instead of continuing with potentially unpredictable behavior.

Given that this patch addresses a critical bug that can cause system failures and data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the renesas_usbhs driver. The issue is described as the controller sometimes not being able to complete the Control write status stage. The patch modifies the code to avoid clearing the PID_BUF in a specific scenario, which can lead to the controller not completing the status stage.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that can cause the controller to fail in completing an important stage. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the provided information:

1. Patch Description: The patch is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file.

2. Context: The cond_resched() call was added to handle the scheduling of atomic context on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE. However, it is not possible to schedule in atomic context on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, making the cond_resched() call unnecessary.

3. Impact: The cond_resched() call is not needed for non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations, and removing it would not cause any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing an unnecessary cond_resched() call that does not fix any real and critical bug or issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an incorrect comparison in the powernow_k6_cpu_exit() function in the powernow-k6 driver.

2. The incorrect comparison is between 'i' (the loop index) and 'max_multiplier'. The patch correctly states that 'max_multiplier' should be compared with clock_ratio[index].driver_data, not the index itself.

3. Additionally, the patch suggests changing the for-loop condition from a hardcoded loop count of 8 to checking for CPUFREQ_TABLE_END. This makes the code more flexible and avoids potential issues if the number of elements in clock_ratio changes in the future.

4. The patch includes the Reported-by, Signed-off-by, and Acked-by tags, indicating that the bug was reported by Viresh Kumar, the patch was signed off by Srivatsa S. Bhat, and it was also acknowledged by Viresh Kumar.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real bug in the powernow-k6 driver. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "rtc: handle errors correctly in rtc_irq_set_state()". This suggests that it aims to fix an issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function.

2. The code checks the correctness of the parameters but unconditionally arms/disarms the hrtimer. This means that even if the parameters are incorrect, the hrtimer will still be armed or disarmed.

3. The consequence of this behavior is that a random task might arm/disarm the rtc timer, surprising the real owner by either generating events or stopping them. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially impact system stability.

4. The patch adds an error handling mechanism by introducing a check for errors. If an error is detected, the function immediately jumps to the "out" label, bypassing the arming/disarming of the hrtimer.

5. The patch also includes the necessary locking mechanism to ensure thread safety.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to error handling in the rtc_irq_set_state() function. It prevents incorrect arming/disarming of the hrtimer and potential surprises for the real owner. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a backport of changes made to the x86 page fault handler for making it retryable and killable. The patch aims to reduce the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation on 64-bit sparc.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. The patch does not fix a build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be an optimization for reducing mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation.

2. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on the above analysis, I would classify this patch as a performance optimization rather than fixing a critical bug. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the check on the PCI device type in vfio_pci_probe() function. The current code incorrectly uses the PCI_HEADER_TYPE value to mask the type value, which is incorrect. The patch fixes this by directly checking the pci_dev->hdr_type.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a fix for a specific behavior in the vfio-pci driver.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is reverting a previous commit (773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c). Reverting a commit suggests that there was an issue with the previous change.

2. The patch author states that the lack of dithering has been reported by a large list of people with various gen2/3 hardware. This indicates that the lack of dithering is a real and critical bug affecting multiple users.

3. The author also mentions that the original patch was nonsensical and unrelated to the reported issue. This suggests that the previous commit did not address the actual problem.

4. The patch includes changes in the "intel_lvds_get_config" function in "intel_lvds.c" and the "intel_gmch_panel_fitting" function in "intel_panel.c". These changes ensure that the dither state is correctly set for gen2/3 hardware.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware. The previous commit did not fix the issue, and the patch provides the necessary corrections. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch modifies the vgic-v3.c file in the KVM subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses the handling of level interrupts in the Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller (VGIC) version 3.

The patch aims to ensure that the line level is always resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. It also clears the soft pending state when level interrupts have been acknowledged.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a specific behavior related to level interrupts in the VGIC. However, it does not explicitly mention any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue that it fixes.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine if this patch qualifies as a critical fix for stable releases. If there is additional context or evidence of a real and critical issue that this patch resolves, it may be considered for inclusion in stable releases. Otherwise, it may be more appropriate for regular kernel development or testing branches.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would lean towards (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes duplicate code. The patch removes the unnecessary resource checks in several drivers and relies on the sanity checks performed by the `devm_ioremap_resource` function instead.

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a build error caused by a conflict with the "ffs" identifier. The error is causing undeclared identifiers and warnings in the code. 

Since the patch is addressing a build error, it can be considered a real and critical bug. However, it does not seem to be related to an oops, hang, data corruption, or a security issue. 

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch can be categorized as a "trivial" fix as it is converting a macro to a function-like macro. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and assess if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch appears to be related to the iwlwifi driver for Intel wireless devices. It introduces a change in the iwl_mvm_sta_tx_agg_stop() function in the sta.c file.

The patch addresses the issue of restarting the device and the driver wiping out all the Rx/Tx Block Ack sessions. In this situation, the patch suggests ignoring requests from mac80211 to stop Tx aggregation while reconfiguring the device.

The reasoning behind this change is that stopping a non-existing Rx BA session is harmless, so it is suggested to honor mac80211's request.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it appears to be a specific optimization or behavior adjustment for the iwlwifi driver.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds locking using zram->init_lock to protect access to zram->meta, preventing invalid memory access if zram->meta has been freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering the patch addresses a potential memory access issue, it can be categorized as fixing a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

The bug occurs when usb_remove_hcd() is called a second time for the second xhci bus, causing it to try to dequeue all pending urbs and touch td_list, which has already been freed for that endpoint.

Given that this bug can potentially lead to data corruption and is not a trivial fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and improves the stability and reliability of the xhci driver.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds status and return request handlers for the wiimote HID driver. This indicates that it aims to handle status reports and return reports from the wiimote device.

2. The patch mentions that the wiimote resets the current drm (Direct Rendering Manager) when an extension is plugged in. To keep the drm consistent, the patch resets the drm on every status report.

3. The patch also handles return reports from the wiimote, which indicate the success or failure of requests sent to the device.

4. The patch includes the necessary function implementations for handling status and return reports.

5. The patch adds two new request IDs, WIIPROTO_REQ_STATUS and WIIPROTO_REQ_RETURN, to the existing enum wiiproto_reqs.

6. The patch defines the handler functions for status and return reports, which call the existing handler_keys function and perform additional operations.

7. The patch updates the handlers array to include the new handlers for status and return reports.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it resolves a specific commit.
5. The patch has been tested by Chris Metcalf.
6. It has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including Peter Zijlstra (Intel) and Ingo Molnar.
7. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues with the scheduler's tick re-enabling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to qeth (QDIO Ethernet) on the s390 architecture. The patch aims to ensure that changes to the blkt (block size) default values are retained during online settings.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to blkt default values being reset during online settings. While it may not be explicitly mentioned whether this issue causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a security issue, it can be inferred that it falls under the category of "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, it can be considered a real and critical bug.

2. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on addressing the specific issue at hand.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug without any trivial changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a false-positive warning issue in the dev_pm_domain_set() function. The issue occurs when attempting to clear the pm_domain pointer after invoking the driver's ->remove() callback, leading to unnecessary warnings.

The patch modifies the dev_pm_domain_set() function to check if the pointer passed to it is NULL and skip the warning in that case. This change ensures that false-positive warnings are avoided.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a false-positive warning issue, which can be considered as an "oh, that's not good" issue.

However, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It provides a targeted fix for the specific issue at hand.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is described as a hardening fix that requires read access for controlling terminal. It mentions that write-only access to other users' ttys is usually only given through setgid tty executables.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the `tty_open` function and the `tiocsctty` function in the `tty_io.c` file.

3. tty_open Function Changes:
   - The patch adds a check to prevent a process with write-only access to the tty from obtaining the privileges associated with having a controlling terminal.
   - It explains that many distributions set the group of all ttys to "tty" and grant write-only access to all terminals for setgid tty binaries, which should not imply full privileges on all ttys.
   - It suggests that if old code performs open() on a write-only file descriptor, it might be necessary to also permit this if `inode_permission(inode, MAY_READ) == 0`.

4. tiocsctty Function Changes:
   - The patch adds a check to prevent a process without read access and without CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability from setting the tty as the controlling terminal.
   - This check is similar to the one added in `tty_open` to prevent write-only access from obtaining full privileges.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a security concern related to write-only access to ttys and prevents processes without read access from gaining full privileges associated with a controlling terminal. It does not seem to fix a critical bug causing build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or any other severe issues.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a supply widget for managing the WM8731 ACTIVE bit. The patch does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a "trivial" fix that does not address any real and critical issue.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to adjusting the display configuration after setting up the power state in the amdgpu driver. The patch includes a change to update the display configuration after setting the power state, which was previously missing.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or adjustment rather than a critical bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to add a check for write access on the underlying inode when truncating a file in the overlay filesystem (ovl_setattr function).
2. It also adds a check for write access on the lower file before performing a copy-up for consistency.
3. The patch includes a test case (test.c) to verify the behavior of the truncate function.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to write access checks during file truncation in the overlay filesystem. It does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue and improves the consistency of write access checks in the overlay filesystem.

Please note that a more thorough analysis, including testing and review by kernel maintainers, is necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a mislabeled USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) in the ftdi_sio driver. It does not fix a real and critical bug that causes any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to the sendfile(2) system call. The patch addresses a scenario where sendfile(2) can be misused to issue lots of writes into arbitrary file descriptors, making them unkillable. This can result in CPU burn and lockup issues.

The patch adds a test for pending signals into the splice_from_pipe_next() function, allowing the process to become killable when there are always buffers available. This change should fix the lockup issues caused by the do-ton-of-tiny-writes nature of sendfile.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an off-by-one error when addressing the IOR (Input/Output Control register) in the 104-quad-8 driver in the iio subsystem. The patch correctly adjusts the base offset by adding 1 to the original value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a relatively minor issue related to register addressing.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a code modification in the vmpressure function in the mm/vmpressure.c file. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch removes the check for pending work in the vmpressure function.
   - The reason given is that the check is racy and doesn't provide much benefit since schedule_work already handles this case.

2. The patch includes the Signed-off-by and Reported-by tags, indicating the author and the person who reported the issue, respectively.

3. It also includes several Cc tags, indicating other individuals who should be notified about the patch.

4. The patch includes the Acked-by tag from Tejun Heo, indicating that he has reviewed and approved the patch.

5. It includes the Signed-off-by tags from Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds, indicating their approval as well.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch removes a potentially racy check and has received approval from multiple individuals, including the original author and maintainers. However, it's important to note that this recommendation is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may require further review and testing in the context of the entire Linux kernel codebase.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue related to the function `xfrm6_find_1stfragopt()` in the IPv6 module. Previously, this function did not handle error codes properly and treated them as a length. The patch aims to address this issue.

2. The patch is associated with the commit `2423496af35d`, which is titled "ipv6: Prevent overrun when parsing v6 header options". This commit suggests that the patch is intended to fix a potential overrun issue when parsing IPv6 header options.

3. The patch is signed-off by Ben Hutchings and has been acknowledged by Craig Gallek.

4. The patch modifies two files: `net/ipv6/xfrm6_mode_ro.c` and `net/ipv6/xfrm6_mode_transport.c`.

5. In both files, the patch adds a check for `hdr_len < 0` after calling `x->type->hdr_offset()`. If `hdr_len` is less than 0, the function returns the error code.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to handling errors in the `xfrm6_find_1stfragopt()` function. The bug fix is associated with a commit that suggests it is addressing a potential overrun issue. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the "weak" attribute from the declaration of the `memory_block_size_bytes()` function in `drivers/base/memory.c`. This change ensures that a non-weak definition is always preferred over the weak one, regardless of link order.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "drm/i915/gen9: Add WaVFEStateAfterPipeControlwithMediaStateClear." It mentions that a register needs to be added to the hardware (HW) whitelist to address a preemption-related issue.

2. Reference and Review:
   The patch references HSD#2131039 and has been reviewed by Jeff McGee. It also includes signed-off-by statements from Arun Siluvery and Tvrtko Ursulin.

3. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies the file `drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_ringbuffer.c`. It adds a new register definition `GEN9_CTX_PREEMPT_REG` at address `_MMIO(0x2248)`.

4. Workaround Initialization:
   In the `gen9_init_workarounds` function, the patch adds a call to `wa_ring_whitelist_reg` for the `GEN9_CTX_PREEMPT_REG` register. This is done to address the "WaVFEStateAfterPipeControlwithMediaStateClear" issue specific to Skylake (skl) and Broxton (bxt) platforms.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to preemption on Skylake and Broxton platforms. It adds a necessary register to the hardware whitelist. Since it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug without containing any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch seems to be aimed at encapsulating qdisc_skb_cb inside other data structures and adding a validation function for skb->cb size.

Since the patch does not fix any critical issue and contains trivial changes, I would recommend not accepting it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix that adds a Qualcomm vendor ID to the list in the amba driver. It does not fix any critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or real security issue. Additionally, it does not seem to address any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak caused by dangling references to the request_queue in the s390/dasd driver. The patch removes the assignment of NULL to the gendisk's queue pointer before the put_disk call.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to memory leaks. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the OMAP4 platform. The patch adds a check for valid clkctrl_offs and flags values in the _omap4_wait_target_ready/disable functions. If the clkctrl_offs is zero and the HWMOD_OMAP4_ZERO_CLKCTRL_OFFSET flag is not set, the functions will return 0 without calling the low-level CM function.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   - It seems to address a specific issue related to the OMAP4 platform, but without further context, it is difficult to determine if it qualifies as a critical bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   - The patch does not directly mention any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   - The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on the information provided, it is not clear if the patch addresses a critical bug or a significant issue that would warrant inclusion in a stable release. Therefore, I would lean towards not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). However, further context and information about the specific bug or issue it addresses would be necessary to make a more definitive decision.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch fixes a bug related to fixed-link PHY registration in the fs_enet driver.
   - It ensures that any fixed-link PHY registered using of_phy_register_fixed_link() is properly deregistered and freed on probe errors and driver unbind.

2. Fixes:
   - The patch references the commit bb74d9a4a87b, which introduced the use of new fixed PHY helpers in the fs_enet driver.

3. Code Changes:
   - Line 980: If there is an error while preparing and enabling the clock, the patch jumps to the label "out_deregister_fixed_link" instead of "out_free_fpi".
   - Line 1061: Adds a new label "out_deregister_fixed_link" to deregister the fixed link PHY if it was registered.
   - Line 1079: Adds a check to deregister the fixed link PHY if it was registered before disabling the clock.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a real bug related to fixed-link PHY registration in the fs_enet driver. It ensures proper cleanup and deregistration in case of errors. Since it addresses a critical issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the xfrm_state_gc_destroy() function of the xfrm_state.c file. The patch adds a kfree() call to free the memory allocated for the aead algorithm name.

Since this patch addresses a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial fixes, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing an issue related to inappropriate zone congestion clearing in the vmscan module of the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that the removal of zone watermark checks from the compaction code in kswapd caused the zone congestion clearing to happen unconditionally on higher order reclaim, which messes up the reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages.

The patch suggests removing the clearing from the zone compaction section entirely and relying on the preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd to clear it if the zone is considered balanced.

Considering the nature of the issue being addressed and the proposed solution, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a real and critical bug that affects the reclaim throttling logic and can potentially lead to performance issues or data corruption. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch by kernel maintainers and testing in various scenarios is necessary before including it in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue with memory allocation in the `smd_pkt_init` function in `msm_smd_pkt.c`. The patch replaces the usage of `IS_ERR` and `PTR_ERR` with a check for `NULL` return value from `kzalloc`.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that improves code readability and correctness.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to accessing registers in the gt power well from userspace in the Intel i915 driver. The patch checks if the hardware generation is less than 6 before allowing userspace forcewake references.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Since the patch is related to accessing registers in the gt power well, it does not seem to address any of the mentioned critical issues. It appears to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than fixing a critical bug.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error by updating the prototype of the `release_pmu` function. This change ensures that possible build failures are prevented when `CONFIG_CPU_HAS_PMU` is not selected.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that can cause build errors, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to false interrupts triggering on UARTs A and B on Tegra chips. This bug can lead to the UART IRQ being disabled and potentially cause issues such as the kernel printing "irq 68: nobody cared". The patch enables UART_BUG_NOMSR to prevent the false interrupts from triggering.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch should be accepted (ACK) because it addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Title: drm/i915/fbdev: Stop repeating tile configuration on stagnation
   - The title suggests that the patch aims to stop repeating tile configuration when there is no progress in finding matching outputs.

2. Patch Description:
   - The patch fixes an issue introduced in a previous patch (b0ee9e7fa5b4) related to tiled monitor configurations.
   - It stops looping over unconfigured outputs when no progress is made in finding matching outputs.
   - The patch uses conn_seq instead of pass to apply tile configuration only on the first pass.

3. Fixes:
   - The patch is marked as fixing the issue introduced by the commit b0ee9e7fa5b4.

4. Signed-off-by and Cc:
   - The patch is signed-off by Chris Wilson and has several people in the Cc list, including maintainers and reviewers.

5. Code Changes:
   - The code changes in the patch modify the `intel_fb_initial_config` function in the `intel_fbdev.c` file.
   - The changes introduce the use of `conn_seq` to track the configured connectors.
   - The patch modifies the loop condition to check if `conn_seq` is zero instead of using the `pass` variable.
   - If the connector has already been configured or does not have tile support, it is skipped.
   - The patch also removes the `pass` variable and the check for `conn_configured` against `mask` after the loop.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to tiled monitor configurations and improves the behavior of the `intel_fb_initial_config` function. It does not seem to introduce any trivial changes or non-critical fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug related to tile configuration and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to interrupt storm caused by incompatible pin attributes between PCI and ISA IRQs. The issue was triggered on a KVM virtual machine and can potentially lead to system instability.

The patch modifies the code in the drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c, drivers/acpi/pci_link.c, and include/linux/acpi.h files. It introduces a new function `acpi_isa_irq_available` to check if an ISA IRQ is available and adds a check in `acpi_pci_link_allocate` to prevent allocating an IRQ that has a penalty level of `PIRQ_PENALTY_ISA_ALWAYS`. Additionally, the patch includes a new warning message in case no IRQ is available for a specific device.

Considering the nature of the bug and the changes made in the patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can cause interrupt storms and improves the compatibility between PCI and ISA IRQs.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a buffer overflow issue when reading the sysfs file of 'pending'. The patch addresses a warning and related memory destruction that occurs when there are a large number of pending requests in the hardware queue.

Given that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to memory corruption and a general protection fault, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a significant issue, making it suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the re-queueing of requests in the dm (device mapper) subsystem. The patch addresses an issue where requeued requests could potentially stay in the queue indefinitely if there are no other I/O activities to the device.

The patch includes a fix by adding the "blk_run_queue_async(q)" function call after requeuing the request. This function call ensures that the queue is kicked and the requeued request is processed even if there are no other pending I/O activities.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or hangs, and it does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a memory leak issue in the ssu100 driver for USB serial devices.
2. The fix involves replacing the ssu100_release function with ssu100_port_probe and ssu100_port_remove functions.
3. The ssu100_release function is no longer needed since commit 0998d0631001288, as the port private data is no longer freed at release.
4. The ssu100_attach function is modified to call ssu100_initdevice, which initializes the device.
5. The ssu100_port_probe function is added to allocate memory for the port private data and initialize necessary structures.
6. The ssu100_port_remove function is added to free the port private data.
7. The patch also updates the usb_serial_driver structure to use the new functions.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real issue (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the commit "Revert 'USB: quirks: add touchscreen that is dazzeled by remote wakeup'" is being reverted. The reason for the revert is that the issue described in the commit was only observed on prototype units and is not seen on newer units.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. Instead, it reverts a previous commit that added a quirk for a touchscreen device.

Since this patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release, the decision would be (B) to not accept it in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a typo in the code that could potentially lead to walking random data. This issue could potentially cause unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a circular dependency issue in the libata transport code. The patch removes the unnecessary reference counting and release functions for the parent device objects.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to address a code improvement rather than a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and check if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

The patch description states that it fixes a calculation issue related to the number of transmitted bytes in the c_can driver. The issue caused incorrect transmit byte counts to be displayed in programs like 'ifconfig'. The patch aims to update the transmitted byte count correctly when multiple CAN messages with different lengths are transmitted together.

Looking at the code changes, the addition of the line "c_can_object_get(dev, 0, msg_obj_no, IF_COMM_ALL);" seems unrelated to the fix. It is not clear why this line is added and how it contributes to fixing the issue.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine if this patch addresses a critical bug or a real security issue. It seems to be more of a functional fix rather than a critical issue.

Considering the criteria mentioned earlier, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my recommendation is to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues with directory navigation and symbolic links in the CIFS filesystem. The bug can lead to the inability to change directories or access symbolic links when the file type is different but the name and inode number are the same.

The patch aims to fix this issue by returning an error when the file type is different. It checks if both the inode number and the file mode (i_mode) remain the same before updating the inode in place. This ensures that the dentry cache is correctly updated when the file type changes.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real issue that can impact functionality and provides a reasonable solution.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch's implementation and testing is necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real bug that causes an Oops. The patch addresses the issue of a missing beep detach in the patch_conexant.c file, which leads to a memory leak and potential Oops. The patch adds a new function `cx_auto_free` that detaches the beep device and frees the codec, and updates the `free` field in the `hda_codec_ops` structure to use this new function.

Given that the patch fixes a critical bug that can cause an Oops and potential memory leak, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to dumping native eBPF programs attached to sockets in the sock_diag_put_filterinfo() function. The patch addresses the problem where orig_prog is always NULL for native eBPF programs, causing a panic when trying to access its filter length or copy the filter instructions.

Considering the patch's purpose is to fix a bug that could potentially lead to a panic, it falls under the category of fixing a critical issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an initialization failure on non-exynos3250 SoCs in the rtc-s3c driver. The patch adds a conditional check to determine if the rtc source clock is needed before attempting to get and enable it. If the clock is not needed, the initialization failure is avoided.

This patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It addresses a specific initialization failure on certain SoCs, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue but not critical.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to white noise on Dell laptops caused by the login screen and headphone. The fix involves adding a new fixup function, ALC292_FIXUP_DISABLE_AAMIX, for the Realtek ALC3235 codec with the Vendor Id 0x10ec0293 and Subsystem Id 0x102806db.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real issue that can cause an undesirable audio problem on Dell laptops. It does not appear to be a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the MIC VOP driver that could potentially lead to kernel memory corruption. The patch adds a check to ensure that a data structure has not changed between two successive reads from user space, thereby preventing the possibility of memory corruption.

Considering that this patch fixes a security issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch and evaluate if they meet the criteria for acceptance.

The patch modifies the cpufreq/intel_pstate.c file and changes the scaling behavior of the intel_pstate driver. It replaces the usage of the max turbo P-state with the max P-state. The change aims to address two issues: 

1. On a quiet system, intel_pstate can fail to respond to a load change.
2. On CPU SKUs with a limited number of P-states and no turbo range, intel_pstate fails to select the highest available P-state.

The patch adjusts the default_policy structure by changing the setpoint value from 109 to 97 and the p_gain_pct value from 17 to 20. Additionally, it sets the i_gain_pct value to 0.

In the intel_pstate_get_scaled_busy() function, the patch replaces the turbo_pstate variable with max_pstate. It calculates the busy_scaled value using the new max_pstate value instead of the current_pstate value.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to changing the MTU when using per-cpu processing in the mvneta driver. The issue causes blocking of all port's interrupts and prevents transmitting data after the MTU change under heavy load.

The patch addresses the problem by disabling percpu interrupts during the reconfiguration of TXQs and RXQs. It introduces two new functions, `mvneta_percpu_enable` and `mvneta_percpu_disable`, which respectively enable and disable percpu interrupts for the mvneta port.

Considering the patch's purpose of fixing a critical issue that can lead to data transmission problems, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes and focuses on resolving a real and critical bug. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, to lock access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. This indicates that there are potential concurrent modifications to the resource tree in other patches of the series.

2. The patch adds the `down()` function call to acquire the semaphore before accessing the resource tree and the `up()` function call to release the semaphore after the access. This ensures proper synchronization and prevents race conditions.

3. The patch also introduces a new variable, `retval`, to store the return value of the function. This allows for better error handling and makes the code more robust.

4. The patch includes the necessary `goto` statement (`goto exit`) to properly handle the case when the resource allocation is successful (`*new` is not NULL). It sets `retval` to 0 and jumps to the `exit` label to release the semaphore and return the success value.

5. The patch is signed-off by multiple authors, including maintainers and developers from Microsoft, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to address a real and critical issue related to concurrent modifications of the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. It introduces proper locking mechanisms and error handling, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a regression in the implementation of drm_vblank_on in Linux 3.18+. The patch aims to address a situation where a kms driver could override the user's choice of reenabling vblank irqs by setting vblank_disable_immediate to true. The patch ensures that vblanks are only reenabled if there are clients left or if the user has requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues with vblank interrupts. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to audio playback on Kirkwood / OpenRD client. The patch fixes a failure in the `asoc_simple_card_hw_params` function when the sysclk setting is not supported.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes the ONDA MT825UP product ID from the driver. The patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a specific device-related fix rather than addressing a broader issue.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that introduces a new macro `div64_long` in the `include/linux/math64.h` file. This macro is used to divide a 64-bit number by a long, depending on the system's architecture.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to handling encapsulation offloads when computing segment lengths in the net core.
2. It introduces a change to the `skb_gso_transport_seglen` function, which calculates the segment length for a given sk_buff.
3. The patch checks if `skb->encapsulation` is set, indicating the presence of inner network headers. If set, it adds the size of the inner network headers to the segment length calculation.
4. The patch also considers the `gso_type` field in `shinfo` to determine if the GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) type is TCPv4 or TCPv6. If it is, it adds the inner TCP header length to the segment length calculation.
5. If `skb->encapsulation` is not set, the patch falls back to the existing behavior of calculating the segment length based on the TCP header length.
6. The patch ensures that the size of the fragmentation payload (for UFO - Unidentified Fragmentation Object) is accounted for correctly.
7. The patch is signed-off by the author and the maintainer.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to encapsulation offloads and correctly calculates the segment length. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential issue that could lead to data corruption or other problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a warning generated by gcc 4.1.2 in the f81534_port_probe() function of the f81534.c file in the USB serial driver.

2. The warning states that the comparison in line 1250 is always false due to the limited range of the data type.

3. The patch suggests using an intermediate variable of type int to fix this issue.

4. Additionally, the patch proposes forwarding the actual error code instead of converting it to -ENODEV.

5. The patch also removes the unnecessary check for F81534_NUM_PORT, as the callee always returns a valid port number in case of success.

6. The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the driver for Fintek F81532/534.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a warning and improves error handling in the f81534_port_probe() function. It does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is updating the blacklist for certain Micron and Crucial SSD drives to reflect the fact that queued TRIM is broken on the M500 drives but working fine on later drives such as M600 and MX200. The patch also adds support for zeroing after TRIM for Micron and Crucial drives.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Instead, it seems to be a routine update to the blacklist and adding support for zeroing after TRIM.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. Description: The patch addresses an issue where the first call of the interrupt handler for CPU1 on the Exynos 4210 SoC is executed on CPU0 due to the timer firing before setting the IRQ affinity. This issue occurs when Multi Core Timer interrupts are shared.

2. Problem: The clock event device is registered before setting the interrupt affinity, causing the timer to start too early.

3. Solution: The patch suggests registering the clock event device after setting the interrupt affinity to prevent the timer from starting prematurely.

4. Impact: This issue can potentially lead to incorrect timer behavior and timing-related problems on the affected SoCs.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause timing issues on the Exynos 4210 SoC. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a type mismatch issue reported by the sparse tool. The issue is related to the assignment of `__le32` type to `u32` type in the `mmc_blk_packed_hdr_wrq_prep` function.

The patch correctly annotates the `packed_cmd_hdr` variable as `__le32` to match the expected type. This ensures proper endianness handling and resolves the sparse warning.

Since this patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a real and critical bug.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds an additional argument to the function `break_stripe_batch_list` in the `md/raid5.c` file. This change allows for conditional setting of the `STRIPE_HANDLE` flag based on the value of the `handle_flags` argument.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the ARM audit code in the Linux kernel. The bug causes incorrect usage of the saved application ip register, which can lead to libc corruption if the ip register is live. The patch aims to fix this issue by updating the syscall tracing code to use the "why" parameter to infer the syscall direction and only update the saved ip register if a ptrace trap will be signaled.

Considering that this patch addresses a critical bug that can potentially lead to data corruption and impacts the stability and security of the system, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption in the UDF filesystem. The patch addresses a race condition between two O_APPEND writes that can result in overwriting kernel buffers beyond the inode, potentially corrupting the filesystem.

The patch acquires the i_mutex before checking whether the write fits into the inode and uses __generic_file_aio_write() to ensure that the check and write are performed within one critical section. Additionally, the patch includes a WARN_ON_ONCE() statement to verify that the i_mutex is locked in the udf_expand_file_adinicb() function.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can lead to data corruption, and the changes made in the patch seem appropriate to mitigate the problem.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix for code indentation in the QP1 GRH flow in the `build_mlx_header` procedure.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the nl80211_send_mgmt() function and the cfg80211_mgmt_tx_status() function in the nl80211.c file.

4. Code Analysis:
   a. In nl80211_send_mgmt(), the patch adds the NL80211_ATTR_WDEV attribute to the nl80211 message. This attribute contains the wdev_id of the wireless device. This change ensures that the wdev identifier is included in the nl80211 notifications for management frame transmission.
   b. In cfg80211_mgmt_tx_status(), the patch also adds the NL80211_ATTR_WDEV attribute to the nl80211 message. This change ensures that the wdev identifier is included in the nl80211 notifications for management frame transmission status.

Based on the analysis, this patch appears to fix a specific issue related to P2P Device and management frame transmission. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new attribute and modifies the code logic. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix rather than addressing a critical bug or issue. The change made in the patch is to initialize the `tls` variable with `target->thread.tls_ptr` instead of leaving it uninitialized. This change does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to MDIO phy device refcounting in the of_mdio driver. The patch ensures that the reference count on the phy device is properly handled when phy_connect_direct() or phy_attach_direct() fails.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as data corruption or system instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch title suggests that it fixes a mask issue in the max3421-hcd driver related to the GPIO control register.

2. The patch author and sign-offs indicate that it has been reviewed and approved by Jaewon Kim and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

3. Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the calculation of the mask variable in the max3421_gpout_set_value() function.

4. The original code sets the mask using "1u << pin_number", which implies that each pin has a separate bit in the register.

5. The patch changes the mask calculation to "1u << (pin_number % 4)", indicating that the GPIO control register is divided into two parts (IOPINS1 and IOPINS2), and each part controls 4 pins.

6. The patch also updates the idx variable calculation to reflect the division of pins into two parts.

7. The patch does not introduce any spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, or other trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real bug in the max3421-hcd driver related to the mask calculation for GPIO output. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and could potentially cause issues such as incorrect GPIO output control.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freeing the per-net sysctl table on net exit in the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) module. The bug is causing an unreferenced object and triggering kmemleak warnings.

The patch includes the necessary changes to free the sysctl table by adding a call to kfree() for the table pointer. This ensures that the per-net sysctl table is properly freed during net exit.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix provided, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to memory leaks. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch and the accompanying explanation, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch reverts a previous commit that introduced a regression in the 3.6-rc kernels. The author explains that the backlight code is lacking locking, which can lead to races and potential issues. The patch aims to address these problems until the races are fixed properly.

The references to the mail archive and Bugzilla provide additional context and support for the decision to revert the commit.

Overall, this patch addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK):

1. The patch aims to address the issue of callers missing the fact that `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count` needs to be called under RCU lock.
2. Instead of providing a new `*_locked()` API, the patch suggests taking the RCU lock inside `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count()` and leaving the callers as they are.
3. The patch adds the necessary RCU lock acquisition at the beginning of `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count()` using `rcu_read_lock()`.
4. If `find_device_opp()` returns an error, the patch sets the error value to `count` and logs an error message before releasing the RCU lock and returning.
5. The patch then iterates through the `opp_list` and increments `count` for each available OPP.
6. Finally, the patch releases the RCU lock using `rcu_read_unlock()` before returning `count`.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a real issue related to missing RCU lock acquisition in `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count()`. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lock-inversion problem in the xHCI driver. The issue is related to threaded interrupts and the use of spin_lock() instead of spin_lock_irqsave() in the xhci_irq() function. The lockdep warning indicates a possible irq lock inversion dependency.

The patch modifies the xhci_irq() function to use spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_unlock_irqrestore() instead of spin_lock() and spin_unlock(). This ensures that interrupts are disabled while acquiring and releasing the lock, preventing lock inversion issues.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to lock inversion and potential deadlocks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. It fixes an issue that can cause hangs and impacts system stability.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition in the firmware loader. The patch ensures that all pending loading requests on the same firmware buffer can see the mapped 'buf->data' once the loading is completed. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to address a race condition, which is important but not critical.

Additionally, the patch contains some trivial changes, such as moving the fw_map_pages_buf() function and adding comments. These changes do not fix any critical issues.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that only involves reordering the cause codes for transaction aborts in the powerpc architecture.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes a hang, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals, and it includes references to bug reports and previous commits.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the tty_wait_until_sent function in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses an issue where the function may take up to twice as long as the requested timeout while waiting for driver and hardware buffers to drain.

The patch modifies the code to take the remaining number of jiffies (time units in the Linux kernel) into account after waiting for driver buffers to drain. This ensures that the timeout actually becomes a maximum timeout as documented.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can potentially cause delays and impact system performance, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to pid allocation in a pid namespace when the init process dies. The patch aims to prevent processes from accessing stale pointers and addresses the problem of waitpid returning before all processes in the pid namespace have exited.

The patch modifies the following files:
- include/linux/pid.h
- include/linux/pid_namespace.h
- kernel/pid.c
- kernel/pid_namespace.c

The changes include adding a new function `disable_pid_allocation` in `pid.h` and modifying the `struct pid_namespace` in `pid_namespace.h` to include a new flag `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING`. Additionally, the patch modifies the `free_pid` function in `pid.c` to remove the assignment of `-1` to `ns->nr_hashed`, and the `alloc_pid` function to check for the `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING` flag before allocating a new pid. The patch also adds the `disable_pid_allocation` function in `pid.c` and modifies the `create_pid_namespace` function in `pid_namespace.c` to set `ns->nr_hashed` to `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING`. Finally, the `zap_pid_ns_processes` function in `pid_namespace.c` is modified to call `disable_pid_allocation` to prevent any more processes from entering the pid namespace.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to pid allocation in a pid namespace. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "dm cache: dirty flag was mistakenly being cleared when promoting via overwrite." This suggests that there was a bug related to clearing the dirty flag during promotion via overwrite.

2. The patch includes changes to the `migration_success_post_commit` function in the `dm-cache-target.c` file.

3. In the original code, the `clear_dirty` function is called to clear the dirty flag for the cache block and origin block.

4. The patch introduces a conditional statement that checks if `mg->requeue_holder` is true. If it is true, the `clear_dirty` function is called as before, and `cell_defer` is also called with `true` as the second argument.

5. If `mg->requeue_holder` is false, indicating that the block was promoted via an overwrite, the `set_dirty` function is called to set the dirty flag for the cache block and origin block. Additionally, `bio_endio` and `cell_defer` are called with appropriate arguments.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a bug related to clearing the dirty flag during promotion via overwrite. The changes seem to be addressing a real issue and are not trivial in nature.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to skb trimming in the TCP stack. The patch addresses an issue where skb truesize can be underestimated when dealing with looped skbs. This bug can be triggered using syzkaller and a filter attached to a TCP socket over the loopback interface.

The patch modifies the __pskb_trim_head() function to return the trimmed length and updates the tcp_trim_head() function to use the returned value to adjust skb truesize and other related variables.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug that can lead to data corruption and has been tested, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to the sh73a0 CPU board and the irqdomain support. The patch modifies the RELOC_BASE value to address a conflict between two irq controllers.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues with other systems.

Therefore, my recommendation is to (A) accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK), but with the caveat that it should undergo thorough testing and review before final inclusion.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a null pointer dereference issue when mounting NFS over v4.1. The issue is caused by the missing "alloc_slot" function for backchannel operations. The patch adds the missing function to the backchannel tcp ops.

Considering that the issue is critical and can lead to a null pointer dereference, which can cause a hang or data corruption, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the radar_required field in the mac80211 module. The bug causes a stale radar_required field, which can prevent new scan requests from starting. The patch addresses this issue by clearing the radar_required field when ieee80211_vif_use_channel() fails.

Considering that this bug can potentially lead to functionality issues and impact the scanning capabilities of the wireless interface, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical issue related to a corrupted file system. The patch adds a new function called `ext4_iget_normal()` which is used for directory tree lookups. This function prohibits the use of directory entries that point at reserved, metadata inodes, treating them as bad inodes. This prevents the corrupted file system from being further modified or deleted, avoiding potential issues.

The patch also includes changes in the `ext4_lookup()`, `ext4_get_parent()`, and `ext4_nfs_get_inode()` functions to use the new `ext4_iget_normal()` function instead of the existing `ext4_iget()` function.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to data corruption and ensures the proper handling of corrupted file systems, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a trivial fix for a typo in the UBI (Unsorted Block Images) driver. The patch corrects the use of "VID" vs. "EC" in the header self-check computation of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to setting the physical active state on the GIC distributor in a preemptible section, which could lead to setting the active state on a different physical CPU than the one intended to run on.

2. The patch proposes a solution by moving the timer flush into a non-preemptible section, ensuring that the active state is set correctly.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Christoffer Dall and Marc Zyngier, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug in the ibmvnic driver. The patch corrects a mistake in the failure path of the ibmvnic_open() function, where it mistakenly calls napi_enable instead of napi_disable. This mistake can lead to a BUG_ON condition for any queues that were enabled in the previous call to napi_enable.

Since this bug can potentially cause issues such as hangs or data corruption, it qualifies as a critical bug fix. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/i915: Prevent timeline updates whilst performing reset" and aims to prevent modifications to the list of requests on the timeline while it is being walked.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references a previous commit that introduced the issue being addressed. This indicates that the patch is intended to fix a specific bug.

3. The patch is signed-off by Chris Wilson, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch includes several "Cc" tags, indicating that it has been sent for review and feedback to specific individuals and mailing lists.

5. The patch includes a "Reviewed-by" tag, indicating that Mika Kuoppala has reviewed and approved the changes.

6. The patch includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website, providing additional context and discussion about the patch.

7. The patch modifies the function `i915_gem_reset_engine` in the `i915_gem.c` file.

8. Within the function, a new variable `flags` of type `unsigned long` is introduced.

9. The function first checks if the engine has an `irq_seqno_barrier` and returns early if it does.

10. The function then checks if the incomplete context is the default context and returns early if it is.

11. The function proceeds to look up the timeline associated with the incomplete context and the engine.

12. The function acquires locks on both the global timeline and the context's timeline to prevent concurrent modifications.

13. The function then iterates over the requests on the engine's timeline and resets any requests associated with the incomplete context.

14. The function also iterates over the requests on the incomplete context's timeline and resets them.

15. Finally, the function releases the acquired locks.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific bug related to timeline updates during a reset operation in the i915 driver. The changes seem to be well-reviewed and necessary to prevent potential issues with concurrent modifications. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch addresses a situation where the mac80211 state machine gets confused due to a failed scheduling of a CSA (Channel Switch Announcement) time event. This confusion can lead to an unstable connection.

The patch disconnects the device if the CSA time event fails scheduling, which is considered the safest action in this case. The patch also includes appropriate sign-offs and review acknowledgments.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can impact the stability of the wireless connection, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes an issue where the ramp delay for buck4 was accidentally enabled when setting ramp delay for unsupported bucks (buck[56789] and buck10).

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Krzysztof Kozlowski and Axel Lin.

4. The patch modifies the `s2mpa01_set_ramp_delay` function in the `s2mpa01.c` file.

5. The patch adds a check to enable/disable ramp delay only for buck[1234], which are the supported bucks.

6. If the regulator is not one of the supported bucks, the patch skips the enable ramp rate operation.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a specific issue related to enabling ramp delay for unsupported bucks and adds a necessary check to prevent enabling ramp delay for unsupported bucks. It does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is reverting a previous commit that restricted a virtual function (VF) from configuring any VLAN mode. The reason for reverting the commit is to allow the same multicast address to be used with any VLAN, which saves multicast filters.

However, the patch also removes code that checks for specific MAC opcode values (QLC_MAC_STAR_ADD and QLC_MAC_STAR_DEL) and returns an error if they are detected. Without this check, it is possible for a VF to configure MAC + any VLAN filter, which was previously disallowed.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be more of a feature change or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch disables PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. This is because if the default PM Domain using PM_CLK is used for PM runtime, the real Clock Domain cannot be registered from DT later. This indicates a potential issue with PM runtime management.

2. The patch replaces explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT for most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms. This simplifies the platform logic and indicates an improvement in handling PM runtime management.

3. Backwards-compatibility with old DTs (mainly for R-Car Gen2) is provided by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT. This ensures compatibility with older DTs.

4. The default PM Domain is still needed for various cases, including backwards-compatibility with old DTs lacking PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy (non-DT) ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support, and legacy SuperH.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses issues related to PM runtime management and improves compatibility with different platforms. It does not seem to be a trivial fix and could potentially fix real and critical bugs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to revert a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The commit being reverted is 23c405912b88.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the following criteria:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? - The patch is reverting a previous fix for a memory leak. If the original fix was indeed addressing a real and critical bug, then reverting it would reintroduce the bug. However, without further information about the original fix, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? - The patch itself does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes? - The patch only removes a kfree() call for par_dev->state. Without additional context, it is unclear whether this removal is trivial or not.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, if the original fix for the memory leak was indeed addressing a real and critical bug, it is likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it would reintroduce the bug.

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The bug is described as setting `map_and_fenceable` to true when the object is not bound to the global GTT, which violates the change introduced in a previous patch.

2. The bug can cause issues: The bug can potentially lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results when the tiling is adjusted.

3. The patch fixes the bug: The patch unbinds the object from the global GTT if it is currently fenceable but will not be after the tiling change. This ensures that `map_and_fenceable` is set correctly according to the new requirements.

4. The patch has been tested: The patch has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals, including the original author and other contributors.

5. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch addresses a real and critical bug, and it does not include trivial changes such as spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the bug.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that removes a direct call to `mvneta_adjust_link()` in the `mvneta_ioctl()` function. The patch removes the unnecessary call and instead directly returns the result of `phy_mii_ioctl()`.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug, cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a workaround for a firmware issue in the igb i210 NIC. The patch adds an additional zeroing of the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register during the igb_get_phy_id function to address the misconfiguration.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. It seems to be addressing a specific issue with the firmware initialization of the igb i210 NIC.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the enabling of the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt in the ravb driver. The commit message states that the driver does not handle this interrupt, so it should not be enabled.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug or addresses a significant issue. However, the patch does not provide any information about the impact of not handling the "Receive FIFO full warning" interrupt.

Without further information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue or whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, I would recommend further investigation or clarification from the patch author or relevant maintainers before making a decision.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix a bug related to releasing overlays in the OMAPFB (OMAP Framebuffer) driver.

2. The bug occurs when omapfb disables all the overlays but fails to remove them from overlay managers.

3. This bug can lead to a crash if omapfb is unbound and bound again or if the omapfb module is removed and loaded while keeping omapdss (OMAP Display Subsystem) around.

4. The patch addresses the issue by calling the `unset_manager()` function for all overlays.

5. The `unset_manager()` function is only called if the overlay has a manager associated with it.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could potentially cause crashes and instability. It also addresses a specific issue related to overlay management in the OMAPFB driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it meets the criteria of fixing a critical bug and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a bug related to the handling of the "End of Table" entry in the dmi-sysfs. The patch moves the end-of-table check after it is handled by the dmi_table function.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real issue that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect behavior. It is not a trivial fix such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition between `copy_process()` and `cgroup_attach_task()`, where `child->se.parent,cfs_rq` may point to invalid (old) ones. This race condition can lead to a "use-after-free" bug and potentially cause a panic.

2. The bug has been observed and caught in RHEL6.4, indicating that it is a real and critical issue.

3. The patch includes a fix that ensures `child->se.parent,cfs_rq` points to valid ones by calling `__set_task_cpu()` after the parent's CPU and task group might have been changed.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Daisuke Nishimura and Peter Zijlstra, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Given these points, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug, and it does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to a panic at kfree in mei_release(). The bug occurs when the flow control request fails, and the "cl->read_cb" pointer is not set to NULL, causing it to point to random memory. This can lead to incorrect pointer references when the client is operated later.

The patch addresses this issue by setting "cl->read_cb" to NULL before releasing it, ensuring that it does not point to invalid memory. This fix prevents the panic and potential data corruption.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to a panic and data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue with the error passive level test in the pch_can driver. The patch modifies the condition for checking if the receive error counter has reached the error passive level.

The original condition (((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) > 127) is incorrect because the receive error counter is limited to a maximum value of 127. The patch suggests using the RP bit (15) to determine if the error passive level has been reached.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption in the pch_can driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing a regression issue in the mtd: gpmi driver. The regression causes the inability to mount the ubifs created by the new NAND ECC layout introduced in commit 2febcdf84b. The patch reverts to the legacy ECC layout to address this issue.

Since the inability to mount the ubifs is a critical bug that affects functionality, this patch can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, it is important to note that the patch does introduce a harmless cosmetic warning about an unused function. While this warning may not be ideal, it does not affect the critical functionality of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to fix a critical issue related to I2C transfer hangs on certain devices. The patch reduces the internal clock frequency of the TWI IP to address the problem. It is mentioned that this fix has no impact on the I2C bus frequency.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to meet the requirements. It addresses a real and critical bug that causes hangs during I2C frame transmission, which can be considered an "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to the confusion between PHY nodes and generic MDIO devices in the of_mdio driver. The patch adds a whitelist of PHY compatibilities and issues a warning if a compatible value known on the whitelist is found.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it addresses a code confusion issue and provides a warning for certain compatible values.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to information leakage in the L2CAP code of the Bluetooth subsystem. The patch initializes the `l2_bdaddr_type` member of `struct sockaddr_l2` and the padding byte for alignment, preventing the leakage of two bytes of kernel stack memory via the `getsockname()` syscall.

Considering that this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to information disclosure, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue in the reiserfs filesystem. The patch addresses the problem of not freeing the commit workqueue when mount fails, which can lead to resource leaks.

Considering that this patch fixes a critical bug that can cause resource leaks, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a real issue that can potentially lead to system instability or data corruption.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a regression caused by a previous patch and addresses a specific issue related to dirty pages not being written out before releasing the lower file. The patch includes a fix that ensures the dirty pages are written out by calling `filemap_write_and_wait()` just before releasing the lower file.

Considering that this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a generic quirk for matching Insyde devices in the bytcr_rt5640 driver. The patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, nor does it address any build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of MTU constraints in vxlan devices without an underlying device. Previously, their MTUs were limited to the conventional ethernet value of 1500, which prevented them from taking advantage of larger MTU sizes like jumbo frames.

The patch allows the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to be set to larger values, up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead. The default MTU remains 1500 for compatibility.

The patch modifies the `vxlan_change_mtu` function to call a new helper function `__vxlan_change_mtu` with an additional parameter `strict` set to true. The helper function calculates the maximum MTU based on the lower device's MTU and adjusts the new MTU if it exceeds the maximum. If the `strict` parameter is true, it returns an error if the new MTU is greater than the maximum, otherwise, it sets the new MTU to the maximum.

The patch also includes a new helper function `__vxlan_change_mtu` that takes the `dev`, `lowerdev`, `dst`, `new_mtu`, and `strict` parameters. This function calculates the maximum MTU based on the lower device's MTU and adjusts the new MTU if it exceeds the maximum. If the `strict` parameter is true, it returns an error if the new MTU is greater than the maximum, otherwise, it sets the new MTU to the maximum.

Overall, this patch addresses a real issue by relaxing the MTU constraints for vxlan devices without an underlying device, allowing them to take advantage of larger MTU sizes. It does not contain any trivial fixes and does not introduce any new issues or risks.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The G2D driver fails to register the video device, resulting in a boot warning and the driver not functioning correctly.

2. The bug causes a functional issue: The G2D driver is unable to register the video device, which can impact the functionality of the system.

3. The patch fixes the issue: By setting the v4l2_dev field in the video_device structure, the G2D driver can successfully register the video device.

4. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch focuses on fixing the registration failure and does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the critical bug and ensure proper functionality of the G2D driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption on termios updates for PL2303 USB devices. The patch compares the encoded settings with the previously used ones before configuring the device to avoid losing bytes when changing serial settings.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the preparation of a port STP update in the net/dsa/slave.c file. The issue is that a driver may return -EOPNOTSUPP from the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev. This issue occurs on a specific switch (6185) that does not support hardware bridging.

The patch modifies the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function by introducing the variables "p" and "ds" and updating the logic for handling SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE. It checks if the switchdev transaction is in the prepare phase and sets ret to 0 if the driver supports port_stp_update. Otherwise, it sets ret to -EOPNOTSUPP. In the commit phase, it calls the port_stp_update function with the appropriate arguments.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that can cause issues with STP state updates on the affected switch.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW accessing the freed buffers and potentially causing a host crash. 

The patch addresses this issue by first deregistering the MR in the firmware (FW) before freeing the fast_reg_page_list and other associated resources. It also includes error handling in case the deregistration fails.

Considering that this patch fixes a potential crash-inducing bug and ensures proper resource management, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a potential issue in the powerpc/eeh subsystem. The patch replaces the use of `list_for_each_entry()` with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe traversal of the EEH devices list, as devices may be removed from their parent PE during iteration.

Since this patch addresses a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior or instability, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds the missing xcopy_pt_cmd->sense_buffer[] required for correctly handling CHECK_CONDITION exceptions within the locally generated XCOPY I/O path. This indicates that it fixes a potential issue related to error handling.

2. The patch also updates target_xcopy_read_source() and target_xcopy_setup_pt_cmd() to pass the sense_buffer into transport_init_se_cmd() to correctly set up se_cmd->sense_buffer. This ensures that the sense_buffer is properly initialized and used in the code.

3. The patch includes reported-by and cc fields, indicating that the issue was reported by Thomas Glanzmann and Douglas Gilbert, and they are also included in the communication regarding this patch. This suggests that the issue has been identified and discussed by relevant parties.

4. The patch is signed-off by Nicholas Bellinger, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to error handling and includes necessary updates to ensure correct behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that causes corruption on the display and reference counting issues.
2. The bug was introduced in a previous commit and was not caught earlier due to specific circumstances.
3. The bug can now surface due to switchless S3 transitions.
4. The patch is reported by Stéphane Marchesin and signed-off by Chris Wilson and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals.
5. The patch includes changes to the i915_drv.h, i915_gem.c, and i915_suspend.c files, which are relevant to the issue being fixed.
6. The patch introduces a new function, i915_gem_restore_fences, which is called in the appropriate places to restore the fences after resume and GPU resets.
7. The patch also includes other necessary changes related to fence handling and initialization.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a critical bug and provides a proper fix for it. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug in the pch_uart driver that can lead to a memory access violation. The patch ensures that the DMA channel is allocated when necessary, preventing the issue from occurring.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is removing a call to `plane->destroy` from the `omap_crtc_destroy` function in the `omap_crtc.c` file. The reason for removing this call is that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework, so the explicit call is no longer needed.

The patch also mentions that the removal of this call fixes a crash caused by double freeing the plane.

Given this information, it appears that the patch is addressing a bug that could potentially cause a crash, which qualifies as a real and critical bug. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a comment explaining the scenario where an RPC client may no longer be held by anyone except the notification callback after its dentries were created.

2. The patch sets the per-net PipeFS superblock before sending a MOUNT notification for the RPC client.

3. If the MOUNT notification fails, the patch jumps to the "err_depopulate" label, which triggers the RPC_PIPEFS_UMOUNT notification and calls "__rpc_depopulate" to clean up the RPC client.

4. Finally, the patch sets "sn->pipefs_sb" to NULL to indicate that the per-net PipeFS superblock is no longer set.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific scenario related to RPC clients and ensures that the per-net PipeFS superblock is properly set and cleaned up. However, without further context or information about the bug or issue being fixed, it is difficult to determine if it meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the severity of the bug, the impact it has on the system, and whether it meets the criteria of fixing a real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or other significant issues.

Please provide more context or information about the bug or issue being fixed so that I can make a more accurate assessment.

2. Change in code:
   The patch modifies the line:
   `result = wacom_get_report(intf, WAC_HID_FEATURE_REPORT, rep_data[0], &rep_data, 2, WAC_MSG_RETRIES);`
   to:
   `result = wacom_get_report(intf, WAC_HID_FEATURE_REPORT, rep_data[0], rep_data, 2, WAC_MSG_RETRIES);`

   The change involves removing the address-of operator (`&`) before `rep_data` in the function call.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the provided information, it seems that `rep_data` is no longer an array, and passing its address to `wacom_get_report()` is incorrect. The patch fixes this issue by removing the address-of operator.

4. Impact:
   The bug being fixed is not explicitly described, but it appears to be related to retrieving the touch_max value. Without the patch, there might be incorrect behavior or unexpected results when retrieving this value.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch and evaluate if it meets the criteria for acceptance.

The patch addresses an issue where Rx data sometimes drops in non-DMA transfer mode due to the read complete condition not being true. The patch modifies the pch_spi_handler_sub function in the spi-topcliff-pch.c file.

The changes made by the patch are as follows:
- If the transfer complete interrupt is received and the tx_index is equal to bpw_len and the rx_index is equal to tx_index, the patch disables interrupts, sets the transfer_complete flag to true, sets the transfer_active flag to false, wakes up the wait queue, and informs pch_spi_process_messages that the transfer is completed.
- If the transfer complete interrupt is received and the above condition is not met, the patch logs an error message.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data loss. It fixes the read complete condition issue and ensures that the transfer is completed correctly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch fixes a bug in the staging driver for the rtl8821ae wireless chipset. The bug causes an undefined behavior warning due to an incorrect loop iteration that writes to an array with insufficient size.

Although the bug itself may not have a significant impact on functionality, it is still a valid bug that should be fixed. The patch changes the size of the `bb_swing_idx_ofdm` array to `MAX_RF_PATH`, which is the correct size based on the context.

Considering that the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch addresses a specific issue related to screen corruption when using FBC. Since screen corruption can be considered a critical bug, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a real and critical bug related to stack overflow when using CONFIG_KASAN with gcc-5. This bug can lead to build errors and potentially cause kernel stack overflow. The patch removes the use of ACCESS_ONCE, which is causing the issue, and has been verified to improve the object code generated by the compiler.

Considering that the bug affects builds with certain compilers and CONFIG_KASAN enabled, and that the patch has been tested and verified to resolve the issue, it would be appropriate to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. It is also mentioned that the patch can be backported to older kernels, indicating its importance for stability and security.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up. The patch includes a call to `mtk_stop()` to properly stop and free DMA resources and restore the state changed by `mtk_open()` during module removal.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to address a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues such as data corruption or system instability. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to replace the usage of `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `truncate_pagecache()` in the `ext4_collapse_range()` function in the `fs/ext4/extents.c` file. The patch's purpose is to truncate the page cache from the specified offset to the end of the file and remove private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. The patch does not fix a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, or a real security issue. Instead, it seems to address an issue related to file truncation and page cache management.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria of fixing a critical bug or a significant issue, it can be considered a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the disabling of the phy in the dwc2/gadget driver. The patch removes redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not fix a critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or real security issues. It seems to address a potential issue with the reference counter and consecutive module inserts, but it does not fall under the category of a critical bug.

Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce a new feature rather than fixing a bug or addressing a critical issue. The patch adds a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM, allowing the HCR to be changed on a per-vCPU basis.

Since the patch does not fix a real and critical bug, and it is not related to build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the correct decision would be (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to freezing groups with stopped tasks in the cgroup freezer subsystem. The patch reintroduces the "is_task_frozen_enough" function and uses it in the original locations where freezing is checked.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix. It creates a freezer cgroup, stops a task within it, and checks if the freezer state transitions to "FROZEN" correctly.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the cgroup freezer subsystem, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real bug: The patch fixes a bug that causes a splat (kernel warning) during the netns destroy path when using xt_hashlimit with both IPv4 and IPv6.

2. The bug has a critical impact: The bug causes a warning and potential data leakage, which can be considered a critical issue.

3. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch modifies the code to ensure the removal of both IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories in the netns destroy path.

4. The patch is signed-off by relevant contributors: The patch is signed-off by Sergey Popovich and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the critical bug and prevent potential data leakage.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that replaces a call to `snprintf` with `strlcpy` to avoid potential issues with formatting characters in the `pdev` name. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue in the DMA debug API related to handling multiple mappings of the same buffer. The patch updates the search algorithm to set the map_err_type correctly and introduces a side effect where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an improvement or optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses the issue of passing the correct pointer to free_irq(). It states that free_irq() expects the same pointer that was passed to request_irq(), otherwise the IRQ is not freed.

2. The patch includes a Coccinelle script that was used to identify the issue.

3. The patch is signed-off by Lars-Peter Clausen, indicating that the author has reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch includes Cc (carbon copy) recipients, including Srinidhi Kasagar and Linus Walleij, suggesting that they have been notified and may have reviewed the patch.

5. The patch is also signed-off by Andrew Morton and Linus Torvalds, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

6. The patch modifies the file drivers/rtc/rtc-pl031.c.

7. In the code changes, the line `free_irq(adev->irq[0], ldata->rtc);` is modified to `free_irq(adev->irq[0], ldata);`, passing the correct pointer to free_irq().

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug by fixing the issue of passing the correct pointer to free_irq(). It does not contain any trivial fixes and has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals, including the author and maintainers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that corrects a bit shifting operation in the f75375_write16 function of the f75375s.c file in the hwmon subsystem. The patch changes the left shift operation (<<) to a right shift operation (>>).

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the correct decision is (B) this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes an incorrect use of BUG_ON in the iscsit_process_nop_out() function. The patch replaces the BUG_ON with a return statement that generates a REJECT + PROTOCOL_ERROR response.

Considering that the incorrect BUG_ON can lead to a potential issue when a flood of zeros in the data stream reaches this block, and it is reported to cause a protocol error, it can be classified as a real and critical bug. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the incorrect alteration of the "kptr_restrict" variable instead of the "dmesg_restrict" variable. The patch adds a CAP_SYS_ADMIN check to both variables, as they are both sensitive.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch seems to fix a real issue that could potentially lead to a security vulnerability. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "xfs: fix remote attribute invalidation for a leaf." This suggests that it addresses a bug related to remote attribute invalidation in the xfs file system.

2. The patch description explains that when invalidating an attribute leaf block, there might be remote attributes that it points to. Due to recent changes in the remote attribute format, the length of the attribute needs to be calculated correctly. The current implementation in xfs_attr3_leaf_inactive() does not do this correctly, so the patch aims to fix it.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

4. The patch is cherry-picked from commit 59913f14dfe8eb772ff93eb442947451b4416329, which suggests that it has already been tested and merged into the mainline kernel.

5. The code changes in the patch modify the xfs_attr3_leaf_inactive() function in the file fs/xfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c. Specifically, it updates the calculation of the attribute length (lp->valuelen) using the xfs_attr3_rmt_blocks() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug related to remote attribute invalidation in the xfs file system. It does not seem to be a trivial fix, as it involves correcting the calculation of attribute length. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "KVM: ioapic: fix assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi (CVE-2014-0155)". It suggests a fix for a bug that causes a BUG_ON assertion failure in the ioapic_service function.

2. Bug Description:
   The bug is reported by QE (Quality Engineering) and triggers a BUG_ON assertion failure in the ioapic_service function. The bug is not reproducible, but there are two possible reasons for its occurrence.

3. Patch Analysis:
   The patch modifies the ioapic_service function in the virt/kvm/ioapic.c file. Specifically, it changes the assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi.

   Before the patch:
   ```
   ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi = ret;
   ```

   After the patch:
   ```
   ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi = (ret < 0 ? 0 : ret);
   ```

   The patch introduces a conditional assignment, setting ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi to 0 if ret is less than 0, otherwise setting it to ret.

4. Patch Justification:
   The patch aims to fix the assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi. It ensures that if the return value of kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic is less than 0, ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi is set to 0. This prevents potential issues caused by an invalid or out-of-range destination address.

5. Criticality Assessment:
   Based on the provided information, it is unclear whether the bug has any real and critical impact. The bug triggers a BUG_ON assertion failure, but its actual consequences are not described. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the criticality of the bug.

6. Triviality Assessment:
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. It addresses a specific issue related to the assignment of ioapic->rtc_status.pending_eoi.

Based on the available information, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, considering the lack of clear criticality and the absence of trivial fixes in the patch, it would be more appropriate to classify this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Further investigation and clarification of the bug's impact would be necessary before considering its inclusion in a stable release.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the firmware code on exynos mcpm systems. It aims to stop relying on the code provided by the bootloader and instead use the kernel's own code for bringing up secondary CPUs.

2. The patch mentions that older bootloaders might have put slightly different code into the location where the firmware expects the kernel's entry point for secondary CPUs. By using the kernel's own code, this potential problem is fixed.

3. The patch includes a simple code jump to the kernel, which is expected to resolve issues caused by older bootloaders and ensure consistent behavior across different hardware.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers and has been tested, indicating that it has undergone review and verification.

5. The changes made in the patch are specific to the exynos-mcpm subsystem and do not appear to be trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Based on these points, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical issue related to firmware code and improves the stability and reliability of the system. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to introduce new functions `task_ppid_nr_ns()` and `task_ppid_nr()` to abstract the lookup of the PPID (real_parent's pid_t) of a process, including rcu locking, in the arbitrary and init_pid_ns. These functions provide an alternative to `sys_getppid()`, which is relative to the child process' pid namespace.

The patch also includes the function `pid_alive()` to check if a process is alive based on its task structure.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be introducing new functionality rather than addressing an existing issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug related to the transmission handling in the dw_mmc driver. The bug causes a sequence break and lock-up when the IDMAC interrupt is handled, leading to incorrect completion of the current request and allowing the next request to proceed even though the data transfer is still in progress.

The patch addresses this issue by removing the setting of the EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE flag after handling the IDMAC interrupt and suggests setting it after the DTO interrupt is generated.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical issue that can lead to lock-ups and incorrect data transfer. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix an issue in the ARM architecture's net code related to the BPF_ALU | BPF_DIV | BPF_K instruction.

2. The problem occurs when emit_udiv() is called with rn == ARM_R0 (r_scratch), and rm is loaded into ARM_R0 before rn. This results in jit_udiv() being called with the same dividend and divisor, which is incorrect.

3. The proposed fix is to load rn first into ARM_R1 and then load rm into ARM_R0. This ensures that the correct values are used for the dividend and divisor in jit_udiv().

4. The patch includes appropriate comments explaining the register overlap issues for different scenarios.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug that could potentially lead to incorrect calculations in the ARM net code. It does not contain any trivial fixes and seems to be a critical issue that could cause data corruption or incorrect behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   - The patch fixes the sane_reclaim() helper for legacy memcg.
   - It ensures that the sane_reclaim() helper returns false for memcg reclaim if the legacy hierarchy is used.
   - This behavior was accidentally broken by commit 33398cf2f360c ("memcg: export struct mem_cgroup").
   - The patch aims to restore the correct behavior.

2. Fixes:
   - The patch references commit 33398cf2f360c ("memcg: export struct mem_cgroup") as the commit that accidentally broke the behavior.
   - This indicates that the patch is addressing a specific bug introduced by that commit.

3. Signed-off-by and Acked-by:
   - The patch is signed-off-by Vladimir Davydov <vdavydov@parallels.com>.
   - It is also Acked-by Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org> and Michal Hocko <mhocko@suse.com>.
   - These indicate that the patch has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

4. Code Changes:
   - The code change is in the mm/vmscan.c file.
   - Specifically, it modifies the sane_reclaim() function.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a specific bug related to the sane_reclaim() helper for legacy memcg. It has been reviewed and approved by multiple individuals. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there was a recent change that was intended to fix an off-by-one error in the OOB-port completion handler in the digi_acceleport driver. However, this change introduced a new off-by-one error instead. This error could lead to modem-status changes going unnoticed, effectively breaking TIOCMGET.

The patch includes a fix for the loop-condition underflow, which is marked for stable. However, it is mentioned that this fix should not be backported without the fix for the off-by-one error.

Considering the nature of the bug and its impact on functionality, it seems to be a real and critical issue that could cause data corruption and affect the proper functioning of the TIOCMGET feature. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is intended to fix a specific issue related to the controllable backlight on Acer C720 and C720P Chromebooks. The patch adds a quirk to ignore the backlight presence check during backlight setup.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the controllable backlight on Acer C720 and C720P Chromebooks.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue?
   The patch does not introduce any of these issues.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   The patch does not appear to contain any trivial fixes.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a typo in the documentation and removes two bits from the DMA channel status register when reading it. The patch does not address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. It seems to be a trivial fix related to documentation and register reading.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze its content.

The patch appears to address a specific issue related to the handling of requests in the DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) driver. It aims to ensure that requests on the barrier_acked_requests list receive the necessary events when IO is thawed after suspension due to a fence_peer handler returning.

The patch introduces changes in two files: `drivers/block/drbd/drbd_req.c` and `drivers/block/drbd/drbd_state.c`. In `drbd_req.c`, the `RESEND` case of the `__req_mod` function is modified to include a check for local-only READ requests and complete them. This change ensures that the resend event finishes correctly for such requests.

In `drbd_state.c`, the `w_after_conn_state_ch` function is modified to include changes related to the handling of connection loss while pending. The `tl_clear` function call is replaced with `_tl_restart` and `_conn_request_state` calls, which apply the necessary events and state changes.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to request handling in the DRBD driver. However, without further context or knowledge of the severity of the issue, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to consider factors such as the impact of the issue, the severity of the bug being fixed, and whether the patch has been tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers and developers.

Therefore, without additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch is titled "dm snapshot persistent: fix missing cleanup in persistent_ctr error path". It suggests fixing a missing cleanup issue in the error path of the `persistent_ctr` function in the `dm-snap-persistent.c` file.

2. Problem Description:
   If an unsupported option is given, the `persistent_ctr` function leaks memory allocated for the 'pstore' and never destroys the 'metadata_wq'.

3. Fixes:
   The patch claims to fix the issue introduced by commit b0d3cc011e53, which added support for a new persistent store option to handle overflow.

4. Code Analysis:
   The patch adds a new variable `r` of type `int` to store the return value of the function. It then modifies the error handling code in the `persistent_ctr` function as follows:
   - If the workqueue allocation fails, it sets `r` to -ENOMEM and jumps to the `err_workqueue` label to perform cleanup before returning.
   - If an unsupported option is provided, it sets `r` to -EINVAL and jumps to the `err_options` label to perform cleanup before returning.

5. Cleanup:
   In the error handling paths, the patch adds code to destroy the workqueue and free the allocated memory before returning with the appropriate error code.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue by adding missing cleanup in the error path of the `persistent_ctr` function. It fixes a potential memory leak and ensures proper cleanup in case of errors. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a build error caused by uninitialized data usage in the hns_dsaf_set_promisc_tcam() function. The error is flagged by gcc-7.0.1, indicating a potential issue with uninitialized variables 'tbl_tcam_data.low.val' and 'tbl_tcam_data.high.val'. The patch initializes the tbl_tcam_data structure to avoid this issue.

Since the patch fixes a build error and addresses a potential bug, it can be considered a real and critical bug fix. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the SP (Spatial Reuse Protocol) in the mac80211 module. The bug causes the SP to remain open indefinitely, preventing the opening of new SPs and responding to poll frames from the client.

The patch addresses this issue by manually clearing the WLAN_STA_SP flag when a frame that was polled during the SP is queued due to a starting A-MPDU session. This ensures that even though the client may not see the EOSP bit, it can still poll new frames in another SP.

Considering that the patch fixes a critical bug that can lead to a loss of functionality and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to freezing in the usb-stor-scan thread. The patch introduces changes to make the usb-stor-scan thread freezable without actually freezing, allowing other threads waiting for scanning to finish to no longer be blocked. It achieves this by requesting a fake signal when freezing and using interruptible sleep to wake the thread early when freezing happens.

Considering that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause hangs and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for the Killer E2500 device ID in the alx driver. This is a hardware-specific patch and does not fix any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues. Additionally, it does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to CPU load average increase caused by the SENSE_PORT command in the mlx4_core driver. The patch suggests using wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() instead of wait_for_completion_timeout() to put the thread in the interruptible state, which does not contribute to the CPU load average.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? Yes, it addresses the issue of increased CPU load average caused by the SENSE_PORT command.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? While it may not directly cause any of these issues, an increased CPU load average can impact system performance and stability.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes? No, the patch introduces a significant change by replacing wait_for_completion_timeout() with wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout().

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real issue and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch addresses a specific issue in the ASoC driver for the nau8825 codec. It fixes an incorrect configuration of the clk_ref_div in the Pre-Scalar of the FLL (Frequency-Locked Loop) register.

Looking at the code changes, it appears that the clk_ref_div value is being assigned directly to the NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK field. However, the correct behavior should be to shift the clk_ref_div value by NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT before assigning it to the field.

The patch correctly modifies the code to include the necessary shift operation:

```
regmap_update_bits(nau8825->regmap, NAU8825_REG_FLL4,
                   NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_MASK,
                   fll_param->clk_ref_div << NAU8825_FLL_REF_DIV_SFT);
```

Additionally, the changes made in the patch seem to be trivial, as they involve adding and removing a few lines of code and updating some field assignments.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the bnx2x driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes incorrect configuration of the VF interrupt scheme, leading to interrupt generation issues for VFs using multiple queues.

The patch modifies the bnx2x_vf_igu_reset() function in the bnx2x_sriov.c file. It updates the calculation of the parent PF value used for configuring the VF interrupt scheme. Instead of using BP_FUNC(bp), it uses (BP_ABS_FUNC(bp) >> 1) to correctly identify the parent PF.

The patch also includes additional debug information to print the value in IGU_REG_VF_CONFIGURATION after the write operation.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause interrupt issues for VFs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that cleans up unused assignments in two different files. Since the patch does not fix any real and critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues, it does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to bookkeeping of skb during the batching process in the hv_netvsc driver. The patch adds proper bookkeeping for the skb of the batched packet, ensuring that the previous skb is properly freed and preventing a potential panic.

The patch also introduces a new function, `move_pkt_msd()`, which moves the packet out of the `multi_send_data` structure and clears it. This function is used to handle the case when a new send section is allocated.

Overall, the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to issues such as panics. It does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a specific issue related to TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) frame transmission in multiple buffers in the 8139cp driver.

2. The patch modifies the `cp_start_xmit` function in the `8139cp.c` file.

3. The issue being fixed is that the first descriptor was not being set up in TSO mode when sending a TSO frame in multiple buffers.

4. The patch introduces a new variable `ctrl` to store the control flags for the descriptor.

5. The `ctrl` variable is initialized with the values of `first_eor`, `first_len`, `FirstFrag`, and `DescOwn`.

6. If the `mss` (Maximum Segment Size) is non-zero, the `LargeSend` flag is set in `ctrl` along with the `mss` value.

7. If the `skb->ip_summed` is `CHECKSUM_PARTIAL`, the appropriate checksum flags (`IPCS` and `TCPCS` or `UDPCS`) are set in `ctrl` based on the IP protocol.

8. Finally, the `opts1` field of the descriptor is set with the value of `ctrl`.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch fixes a specific issue related to TSO frame transmission in the 8139cp driver. It introduces necessary changes to correctly set up the first descriptor in TSO mode and handle checksum flags appropriately. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to TSO frame transmission in the 8139cp driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the USB gadget UVC driver. It changes the "length" field in the "uvc_request_data" structure from an unsigned int to __s32 (a signed 32-bit integer). The purpose of this change is to allow the "length" field to be used to signal an error by setting it to a negative value.

The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Fernandez Gonzalo. It also includes a "Signed-off-by" tag from Laurent Pinchart, who made the patch, and Greg Kroah-Hartman, who reviewed and approved it.

The patch is also CC'd to the stable mailing list, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in the stable branch of the Linux kernel.

Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the "uvc_send_response" function in the "uvc_v4l2.c" file. It adds a check to ensure that the "length" field is not negative before proceeding with further operations. The "min_t" macro is used to assign the minimum value between "uvc->event_length" and "data->length" to the "req->length" field.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific bug and introduces a necessary change to fix it. It does not contain any trivial fixes or cosmetic changes. Therefore, it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a logical omission in the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() function in the dwc2 USB driver. The patch addresses memory manipulation issues and ensures that Host DDMA bulk transfers work correctly.

The patch also fixes a bug introduced by a previous patch that caused the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() function to return a failure status even when the descriptor was processed normally. This resulted in an incorrect break from the loop processing the remaining descriptors assigned to the QTD.

The patch modifies the dwc2_process_non_isoc_desc() function to properly handle the failure status and the completion of non-isochronous transactions in Host DDMA mode. It also updates the debug message to provide relevant information.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect behavior in the USB driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to copying the upper halves of the vector registers instead of the lower halves in the REGSET_VX_LOW ELF notes. The patch correctly modifies the memcpy call to copy the lower halves of the SIMD registers.

Since this patch fixes a real bug that could potentially cause data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a critical bug: It addresses a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race condition in the probe function of the legousbtower driver. This bug can lead to potential security vulnerabilities and local privilege escalation.

2. The patch restructures the probe function: The probe function is modified to only register the interface after successfully reading the board's firmware ID. This ensures that the interface is registered correctly and avoids potential issues.

3. The patch includes proper error handling: If there is an error receiving the device's firmware ID, the patch handles it by deregistering the USB interface and providing an appropriate error message. This prevents any further issues related to the incomplete registration of the device.

4. The bug has existed since 2003: The patch addresses a long-standing bug that has been present for a significant period of time. Fixing such long-standing bugs is crucial for maintaining the stability and security of the Linux kernel.

5. The patch has been tested: The patch has been tested by emulating the device, which adds confidence in its effectiveness.

Considering the critical nature of the bug, the proper error handling, and the testing performed, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the per-device workqueue (`rq_wq`) and replaces it with a single workqueue for all devices (`rbd_wq`). This change is aimed at improving the efficiency of the workfn processing for devices.

The patch also removes the allocation and destruction of the per-device workqueue in the `rbd_dev_device_setup` and `rbd_dev_device_release` functions, respectively. Instead, it allocates and destroys the single workqueue (`rbd_wq`) in the `rbd_init` and `rbd_exit` functions.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of an optimization change rather than a bug fix.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the warning message from pr_warn to pr_info and adds a printout of the supported RAPL domains. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the sp5100_tco watchdog driver. The bug causes ACPI to malfunction due to incorrect register offsets being used. The patch introduces a helper function to check for the correct register layout and uses it consistently throughout the code.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems to address a real and critical issue that could potentially lead to system instability or data corruption. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a real and critical bug related to power-map configuration for speaker-pins on certain HP laptops. The bug causes the driver to incorrectly treat these pins as jack-detectable, leading to a lack of sound from the speakers.

The patch proposes a fix by replacing the check of persistent power-map bits with a proper is_jack_detectable() call. This change should resolve the confusion caused by the BIOS on affected HP laptops.

Considering that this patch addresses a real bug that affects sound functionality on specific hardware, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix concurrent access to `alloc_blocks` in `hfsplus_inode_info()` by protecting it with the `extents_lock` mutex. This is important to prevent possible allocation bitmap corruption in race conditions while extending and truncating files.

2. The patch includes changes to two instances where `alloc_blocks` modification was not protected with the `extents_lock` mutex.

3. The patch also includes the removal of an unused label `out`.

4. In the `hfsplus_file_extend()` function, the patch acquires the `extents_lock` mutex before modifying `alloc_blocks` and then releases it before returning.

5. In the `hfsplus_file_truncate()` function, the patch acquires the `extents_lock` mutex before modifying `alloc_blocks` and releases it before returning.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug related to concurrent access to `alloc_blocks` in the `hfsplus_inode_info()` function. It also fixes a potential allocation bitmap corruption issue. The changes made in the patch seem appropriate and necessary to ensure proper synchronization and prevent data corruption.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific corner case in the pxa_dma driver where the residue calculation may return an incorrect value. The issue occurs when the transfer is ongoing and the current transfer pointer changes to the "finisher/linker" descriptor. In this case, the residue returned is the whole transfer length instead of 0.

The patch addresses this issue by ensuring that the current transfer pointer is read before checking the descriptor completion. It includes a memory barrier (rmb()) to prevent reordering of the load and the test.

Considering the nature of the issue and the fix, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect residue calculation. Additionally, the fix does not appear to contain any trivial changes.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for different device IDs of the Petatel NP10T modem. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug, nor does it address any build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. It seems to be a trivial fix that adds support for new device IDs.

Therefore, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) as it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to replace the use of VM_NO_THP and VM_BUG_ON with an actual VMA check in the mm/huge_memory.c file.

2. The issue being addressed is that khugepaged (a kernel thread responsible for collapsing transparent huge pages) cannot distinguish private /dev/zero mappings from other special mappings like /dev/hpet, which leads to false-positive VM_BUG_ON and incorrect installation of Transparent Huge Pages (THP) where they are not expected.

3. The patch is reported by Dmitry Vyukov and fixes a bug introduced by commit 78f11a255749, which is related to /dev/zero MAP_PRIVATE and vm_flags cleanups.

4. The patch is signed-off by Konstantin Khlebnikov and has been acknowledged by Vlastimil Babka and Kirill A. Shutemov.

5. The patch is also CC'd to Dmitry Vyukov, Andrea Arcangeli, and the stable mailing list.

6. The code changes in the patch involve modifying the khugepaged_enter_vma_merge() and hugepage_vma_check() functions in mm/huge_memory.c.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real bug that can lead to false-positive VM_BUG_ON and incorrect THP installation. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, and it fixes an issue introduced by a previous commit.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes a bug related to the detection of BREAK on the sunsab serial console. Previously, BREAK detection was only performed when there were also serial characters received simultaneously. However, to handle all BREAKs correctly, the patch duplicates the code fragment responsible for checking for BREAK and calling uart_handle_break(). This duplicated code is then pulled out of the loop over the received characters.

The patch is signed-off by two contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them. It applies to the 3.16-rc6 version of the kernel.

This patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause issues with the detection of BREAK on the sunsab serial console. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, this patch meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases and should be included.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use `xfs_icluster_size_fsb()` to calculate the inode alignment mask when the block size is larger than the inode cluster size.

2. The patch explains that when the block size is larger than the inode cluster size, the call to `XFS_B_TO_FSBT(mp, mp->m_inode_cluster_size)` returns 0.

3. It also mentions that `mkfs.xfs` would have set `xfs_sb->sb_inoalignmt` to 0.

4. Due to the above conditions, in `xfs_set_inoalignment()`, `xfs_mount->m_inoalign_mask` gets initialized to -1 instead of 0.

5. However, `xfs_mount->m_sinoalign` would be correctly initialized to 0 because the condition `!(mp->m_dalign & mp->m_inoalign_mask)` would evaluate to false for every positive value of `xfs_mount->m_dalign`.

6. The patch states that `xfs_imap()` works fine even with `xfs_mount->m_inoalign_mask` having -1 as the value because `blks_per_cluster` variable would have the value 1, and hence there would be no need to use `xfs_mount->m_inoalign_mask` to compute the inode chunk's agbno and offset within the chunk.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch addresses a specific scenario where the inode alignment mask is not correctly initialized. However, it does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Additionally, the patch seems to be more of an optimization rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an error handling issue in the HID cp2112 driver. The patch modifies the `cp2112_gpio_direction_input` function to correctly handle the case of a zero-length report. 

The change in the patch is replacing the condition `ret <= 0` with `ret < 0` in the return statement. This change ensures that if `ret` is less than zero, it will be returned as the error code, otherwise, `-EIO` will be returned.

Considering the patch fixes an error handling issue and does not contain any trivial changes, it seems to meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch aims to address an issue related to hangs in certain cases when the VM is used in the radeon driver. The patch suggests flushing the VM for every IB (Instruction Buffer) to mitigate the problem.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the criteria mentioned earlier. 

1. Does the patch fix a real and critical bug? 
   Yes, the patch addresses hangs in certain cases, which can be considered a critical bug.

2. Does the bug cause a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a real security issue?
   The bug causes hangs, which can be considered a significant issue but not necessarily a build error, an oops, data corruption, or a security issue.

3. Does the patch contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)?
   Based on the provided patch, it does not seem to contain any trivial fixes.

Considering the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug. However, further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the patch effectively resolves the hang issue without introducing any regressions.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a bug that can cause a kernel NULL pointer dereference and subsequent crash. This is a critical issue that can lead to system instability and potential security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to comply with the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases. The patch addresses a potential issue in the suspend flow of the iwlwifi driver. It ensures that if the suspend flow fails and the hardware needs to be restarted, the fw_restart module parameter is taken into account. This allows for better debugging and avoids losing the firmware state when an error occurs during the start of the D3 image.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc64 architecture. The warning indicates that the function `find_numa_latencies_for_group()` references the function `find_mlgroup()` without the appropriate `__init` annotation.

The patch suggests adding the `__init` annotation to both `find_numa_latencies_for_group()` and `find_best_numa_node_for_mlgroup()` functions. It also includes the necessary changes to the function declarations.

Considering the patch's purpose is to address a section mismatch warning, which does not fall under the criteria of a critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or a real security issue, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix. Therefore, I would not recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The commit message states that this patch fixes a potential crash in __netdev_pick_tx() caused by an issue in the normal forward path, specifically related to sender_cpu & napi_id skb fields being a union.

2. The patch is intended to fix the same issue in the bridge, where skb can be forwarded.

3. The bug triggers if the packet was received on a NIC using skb_mark_napi_id().

4. The Fixes tag references a previous commit that fixed xps for stacked devices.

5. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and reported and tested by Bob Liu.

6. The change made in the patch is to add the skb_sender_cpu_clear() function call before dev_queue_xmit(skb) in the br_dev_queue_push_xmit() function in br_forward.c.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential crash issue and is fixing a bug related to skb fields being a union. It also has proper sign-off and testing information.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the function `cpsw_ale_stop` from the `cpsw_ale_destroy` function in the `cpsw_ale.c` file. The reason for this change is to address a deadlock issue that occurs when the `ti_cpsw` module is inserted and removed, causing a delete timer to be created and destroyed.

The patch is removing the call to `cpsw_ale_stop` in the `cpsw_ale_destroy` function. However, without further context or information about the deadlock issue and the impact of removing this call, it is difficult to determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

To make an informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the root cause of the deadlock issue and evaluate the impact of removing the `cpsw_ale_stop` call. Additionally, it would be helpful to review any discussions or testing related to this patch to assess its effectiveness and potential side effects.

Without this additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether the patch should be accepted (ACK) or not (NAK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue related to the VMMOUSE driver in the Linux kernel. The patch removes the request_region() and release_region() calls for the VMMOUSE_PROTO_PORT, which is a port reserved by the ACPI module during system startup. The patch also removes the check for port availability and the associated error handling.

Considering the patch's purpose is to remove the port reservation and allow other drivers to reserve it, it seems to address a specific issue related to port availability. However, it does not fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other "oh, that's not good" issue.

Therefore, based on the criteria provided, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Description of the problem:
   The current implementation of nfs4_handle_exception in nfs4proc.c can cause a hang in a specific test case where a client tries to lock a file after the server returns NFS4ERR_BADSESSION. The open recovery is not scheduled properly, leading to the hang.

2. Proposed solution:
   The patch suggests waiting for session recovery to run before retrying the lock. This will ensure that the session recovery is completed before proceeding with the lock attempt.

3. Analysis:
   The problem described seems to be a real issue that can cause a hang in certain scenarios. The proposed solution of waiting for session recovery before retrying the lock appears to address the problem directly.

4. Impact assessment:
   The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change existing behavior. It only modifies the control flow within the nfs4_handle_exception function to ensure proper synchronization with session recovery.

5. Patch quality:
   The patch is signed-off by two contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them. It also includes a clear description of the problem and the proposed solution.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real issue that can cause a hang and does not contain any trivial fixes.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "mac80211: stop polling in disassociation" and aims to stop connection monitor poll during disassociation. This is done by calling the `ieee80211_stop_poll` function.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue where a scan is deferred due to connection monitoring while disassociation happens. This can cause problems connecting to another access point (AP) because the scan blocks further scan requests until the interface is brought down and up again.

3. The patch includes the necessary changes in the `ieee80211_set_disassoc` function to call `ieee80211_stop_poll` before disassociating from the AP.

4. Additionally, the `ieee80211_sta_connection_lost` function no longer calls `ieee80211_stop_poll` as it is already called in `ieee80211_set_disassoc`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real issue related to connection monitoring and disassociation, which can cause problems connecting to other APs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a specific issue related to the Realtek ALC889 audio codec on VAIO Z machines. The patch addresses a regression that causes silent output from the speaker. 

The patch introduces a fix-up to choose the speaker pin as the primary output, ensuring that the correct DAC is assigned on this device. It also adds a new fixup function, `alc882_fixup_no_primary_hp`, which prevents the HP output from being taken as the primary output on VAIO Z machines.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it addresses a specific regression on a specific hardware configuration, it seems to meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release. The issue it fixes can be considered a real and critical bug that affects the functionality of the audio output.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the tick broadcast mechanism in the Linux kernel. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.

1. The patch adds a check for the broadcast device mode being TICKDEV_MODE_PERIODIC.
   - This is a valid condition to check for, as it determines if the system is in periodic mode.

2. If the broadcast device is in periodic mode, the patch checks if it is hrtimer-based.
   - This additional check is necessary to handle the specific case of a hrtimer-based broadcast device.

3. If the broadcast device is hrtimer-based, the patch returns -EBUSY.
   - This indicates that the system cannot handle hrtimer-based broadcasts properly.

4. The patch includes proper attribution and references.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue related to hrtimer-based broadcast devices in periodic mode. It does not appear to be a trivial fix, as it introduces a new condition and returns an error code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to connection polling in the mac80211 module. The bug was introduced in commit 392b9ff, which accidentally removed the setting of IEEE80211_STA_CONNECTION_POLL, rendering the connection polling useless.

The patch correctly adds the missing setting of IEEE80211_STA_CONNECTION_POLL, ensuring that the flag is properly set. This fix addresses a real issue that could potentially impact the functionality of the module.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to passing arbitrary data to the sideband interface in the DRM driver for Intel DSI panels. The change restricts the data passed to the sideband interface to only the least significant bit (LSB) of the original value.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to address a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be more of a preventive measure or a minor improvement rather than a fix for a critical issue.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and evaluate if it meets the criteria mentioned earlier.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a potential "oh, that's not good" issue rather than a critical bug. It seems to fix a specific issue in the CEC subsystem, but it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a stable release as it does not address a critical bug or a real security issue. Therefore, my recommendation is (B) to not accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing a redundant error check on the return code of `copy_to_user`. The check is already made a few lines earlier, and this redundant check is considered logically dead code.

Since this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue, it can be considered a trivial fix. Therefore, the patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a possible information leak and improves the handling of credentials when switching to a new memory map (mm). Here is the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch addresses a previous behavior where switching to new credentials was delayed until after mapping the executable. This behavior is odd since the new executable should actually run with the new credentials.

2. The patch also ensures that profiling events and tracing are turned off before mapping the new executable state. This is important to prevent potential information leaks.

3. The patch includes acknowledgments from several individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch adds a call to the "install_exec_creds" function after setting up the new execution environment. This ensures that the new credentials are installed before proceeding with the execution.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential information leak and improves the handling of credentials during the execution of a new executable. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix an unchecked dereference of the `arch_pwrdm` variable in the `arch/arm/mach-omap2/powerdomain.c` file. This issue was reported by Dan Carpenter and has been acknowledged by Nishanth Menon.

The patch checks if `arch_pwrdm` is not null and if `arch_pwrdm->pwrdm_wait_transition` is not null before calling `arch_pwrdm->pwrdm_wait_transition(pwrdm)`. This change ensures that the dereference is safe and avoids potential issues.

Considering that the patch fixes a real bug and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding support for a new revision of Apple's wired aluminum keyboard. This patch does not fix any real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It seems to be a trivial addition of USB device IDs for the new revision of the keyboard.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

2. The patch does not contain trivial fixes: The patch does not include any trivial changes like spelling corrections or whitespace cleanups. It focuses on fixing the bug mentioned above.

3. The patch introduces a necessary change: The patch updates the proc_ns_follow_link function to use nd_jump_link instead of manually updating nd.path.dentry. This change is required due to a VFS change that mandates the use of nd_jump_link.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off: The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Eric W. Biederman, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a mutex lock definition for `trace_types_lock` in `trace_events.c`. This lock is used to protect the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list.

2. The patch also adds an external declaration for `trace_types_lock` in `trace.h`.

3. In the `subsystem_open` function, the patch adds a mutex lock before accessing the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list and unlocks it afterward.

4. In the `trace_add_event_call` function, the patch adds a mutex lock before registering and adding an event to the tracers, and unlocks it afterward.

5. In the `trace_remove_event_call` function, the patch adds a mutex lock before removing an event call, and unlocks it afterward.

6. In the `trace_module_notify` function, the patch adds a mutex lock before handling module notifications, and unlocks it afterward.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch adds necessary mutex locks to protect the `ftrace_trace_arrays` list and ensures proper synchronization when accessing it. This addresses a potential concurrency issue and improves the stability of the code.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

5. The patch does not contain any trivial fixes like spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, as it focuses on addressing the specific bug.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the identified bug in the Nouveau driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that adds a printk statement and assigns the value of "op.value" to the "err" variable. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. Therefore, I would classify this patch as a trivial fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch changes the usage of strncpy to strscpy in the orangefs_inode_getattr function in the orangefs-utils.c file.

2. The patch addresses a potential issue where a rogue client-core could send a symlink target that is not NUL terminated, which could result in corrupt data.

3. The patch uses strscpy instead of strncpy to copy the link target, which has a maximum length defined by ORANGEFS_NAME_MAX.

4. If the strscpy function returns -E2BIG, indicating that the link target exceeds the maximum length, the patch sets the return value to -EIO and jumps to the "out" label.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue related to corrupt data in the orangefs_inode_getattr function. It replaces strncpy with strscpy, which is a safer alternative. Additionally, it handles the case where the link target exceeds the maximum length by returning -EIO.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that could lead to data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to enable journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled for the ext4 filesystem. This patch seems to address a potential issue related to data integrity and security. 

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to fix a build error, an oops, a hang, or data corruption. However, it does address a real security issue by enabling journal checksumming when metadata checksumming is enabled. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a critical bug that causes a panic due to an inability to handle a kernel paging request. The bug is caused by freeing a Tx frag that was never mapped before. The patch modifies the loop in the `qlcnic_release_tx_buffers` function to start from index 1 instead of 0, ensuring that only mapped Tx frags are freed.

Given that the bug causes a panic and the patch addresses the issue directly, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a build error that occurs when building with a modular phylib. Without the patch, the 'ksz9021rn_phy_fixup' function is undeclared, causing a build error.

2. The patch addresses the issue by checking if phylib is built-in rather than enabled. This ensures that the 'ksz9021rn_phy_fixup' function can be called from platform code even if phylib is a module.

3. The bug was originally reported by Artem Bityutskiy and partially fixed in a previous commit.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a specific issue related to modular phylib. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a regression introduced by commit 5ed0bdf21a85d78e04f89f15ccf227562177cbd9, which changed the behavior of negative timeouts in the WAIT_IOCTL function in the i915 driver.

2. The previous behavior of negative timeouts was to wait indefinitely, but the regression caused negative timeouts to return immediately.

3. The patch includes a testcase (igt/gem_wait) and references a bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89494), indicating that it addresses a real issue.

4. The patch is signed-off by the author (Chris Wilson) and reviewed by Daniel Vetter.

5. The patch includes a minor fix for a checkpatch complaint about whitespace.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression, addresses a real issue, and has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the HIH6130/1 sensor and certain I2C bus drivers that do not allow zero-length data transfers. The patch proposes a workaround by writing a zero dummy byte, which is ignored by the sensor. The patch has been tested and verified to work with the OMAP I2C bus driver on a BeagleBone board.

The changes in the patch are limited to the "hih6130.c" file in the "drivers/hwmon" directory. The patch introduces a new variable "write_length" in the "hih6130" structure to store the length for the I2C measurement request. Additionally, the patch modifies the "hih6130_update_measurements" function to handle the case where zero-length packets are not allowed by the I2C bus driver.

The patch also includes a check in the "hih6130_probe" function to determine if the I2C bus driver supports the I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_QUICK functionality. If not, the "write_length" variable is set to 1, indicating that a dummy byte should be written to allow sensor measurements on such systems.

Overall, the patch addresses a real issue related to I2C bus drivers and provides a practical solution. It does not contain any trivial fixes and meets the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that changes the return value of the probe function from "err" to 0. This change does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It is a simple return value modification.

Therefore, this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch adds support for emac on dm816x, which refers to two emac controllers with separate memory areas.

2. Cc and Signed-off-by:
   The patch includes Cc recipients and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. Changes in davinci_emac.txt:
   The patch modifies the davinci_emac.txt file to include an additional compatible string "ti,dm816-emac" in the required properties section.

4. Changes in davinci_emac.c:
   The patch adds a new entry in the emac_platform_data structure for dm816_emac_data, which specifies the version as EMAC_VERSION_2.

   The patch adds a new entry in the davinci_emac_of_match array for the "ti,dm816-emac" compatible string, with the associated data set to &dm816_emac_data.

Based on the analysis, it appears that this patch adds support for the dm816x emac controllers and includes the necessary changes in the device tree bindings and driver code. Since it addresses a specific hardware support issue and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered a valid fix for a real and critical bug. Therefore, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a revert of a previous commit. The commit being reverted is "s390/kdump: Clear subchannel ID to signal non-CCW/SCSI IPL". 

The patch description explains that there are use cases where an intermediate boot kernel uses kexec to boot the final production kernel. In this scenario, the original boot information should be provided to the production kernel. Therefore, clearing the boot information during kexec should not be done.

Looking at the code changes, the lines that clear the subchannel ID and number have been removed. These lines were previously used to signal the new kernel that no CCW or SCSI IPL has been done during kexec and kdump.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is reverting a change that is necessary for specific use cases involving kexec and kdump. Without further information about the specific bug or issue that this patch is addressing, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and analysis of the bug or issue that this patch is addressing before making a final decision on whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch enables a workaround for the P2020/P2010 erratum eTSEC 20, which causes excess delays when transmitting large frames with TOE (TCP/IP hardware accelerations) enabled. This erratum was fixed in Rev 2.0.

2. Impact:
   Frames larger than 2500 bytes with TOE enabled may experience excess delay before transmission starts.

3. Patch Changes:
   The patch adds a check for the specific P2020 and P2010 versions with revisions less than 0x20. If the check passes, the GFAR_ERRATA_76 flag is set in the "priv->errata" variable.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug (excess delays in transmitting large frames with TOE enabled) caused by the eTSEC 20 erratum in P2020/P2010 versions. The patch provides a necessary workaround for affected systems, improving their functionality and performance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to the xHCI driver in the Linux kernel. The bug causes a race condition between URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer, potentially leading to an oops in certain scenarios.

The patch modifies the xhci_urb_dequeue() function to remove TDs (Transfer Descriptors) from the TD lists and canceled TD lists before giving back the URB. It also includes additional changes in various functions to ensure proper removal of TDs from the lists.

Considering that the patch addresses a critical bug that can cause an oops and potential data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the MIPS architecture in the KVM module. The patch addresses a potential problem with accessing guest code during MMIO load completion, which could lead to reading the branch instruction from host user memory instead. 

The patch calculates the resume PC in advance and saves it in the vcpu->arch.io_pc field. It then restores the saved resume PC on MMIO completion. This change ensures that the correct branch instruction is read from the guest code.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially cause data corruption or incorrect execution in the MIPS architecture with KVM.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real issue related to interrupt timeout handling in the net/mvmdio driver. The patch ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, which guarantees that wait_event_timeout will always wait at least 1 jiffie.

Since this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to timeouts and incorrect behavior, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix related to handling power-gating for the VCE (Video Codec Engine) block in the AMDGPU driver. The patch checks if the power-gating support for VCE is enabled before attempting to start or stop the VCE block.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider if it fixes a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue.

Without further context or information about the bug being fixed, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided code changes, it seems to be a targeted fix related to power-gating support for the VCE block. It does not appear to address any critical issues such as build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) unless there is additional information or context that indicates it addresses a critical bug or issue.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "sunvnet: Initialize network_header and transport_header in vnet_rx_one()". It suggests initializing the network_header and transport_header fields in the skb structure created in the vnet_rx_one() function.

2. The patch is signed-off by Sowmini Varadhan <sowmini.varadhan@oracle.com> and David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>, who are recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

3. In the vnet_rx_one() function, after checking the version of the VIO interface, the patch calls skb_reset_network_header(skb) to reset the network_header field of the skb.

4. The patch then checks if the received packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag set. If the packet is an IPv4 packet (skb->protocol == ETH_P_IP), it initializes the iphdr structure pointer (iph) using the ip_hdr() helper function.

5. The patch sets the iphdr checksum field (iph->check) to 0 and recalculates the checksum using ip_send_check(iph).

6. Next, the patch checks if the received packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag set and if skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE. If both conditions are true, it further checks if the packet is an IPv4 packet (skb->protocol == htons(ETH_P_IP)).

7. If the packet is an IPv4 packet, the patch initializes the iphdr structure pointer (iph) again and calculates the IP header length (ihl) in bytes.

8. The patch then calls skb_reset_transport_header(skb) to reset the transport_header field of the skb and sets the transport_header field to the correct offset (ihl) using skb_set_transport_header(skb, ihl).

9. Finally, the patch calls the vnet_fullcsum() function to compute the full checksum for the packet.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to checksum calculation for IPv4 packets in the sunvnet driver. It ensures that the network_header and transport_header fields are properly initialized and that the checksum calculation is performed correctly.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a critical bug and improves the stability and security of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload). The bug occurs when the buffer is within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of a 4G boundary. The patch introduces a workaround to detect and handle this condition.

Considering that data corruption is a critical issue, and the patch addresses a specific hardware revision (ASIC_REV_5762), it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, to make a final decision, it would be helpful to review the patch in more detail, including any potential side effects or regressions it may introduce.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that does not address any real and critical bug, build error, oops, hang, data corruption, or security issue. The patch simply moves the call to `omap_hsmmc_context_save()` to a different location within the `omap_hsmmc_probe()` function.

Since the patch does not meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases, I would recommend not accepting it (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug: The patch fixes a double fetch bug in the ioctl function of the cros_ec_dev driver. This bug could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" change between the two copy_from_user() calls.

2. The patch ensures data integrity: By verifying that "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" have not changed between the copy_from_user() calls, the patch prevents potential buffer overflows and data corruption.

3. The patch handles a potential issue with cros_ec_cmd_xfer(): The patch takes into account that cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value. It uses the new smaller value to avoid copying too much data to the user.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: The patch includes the Reported-by, Fixes, Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Tested-by tags, indicating that the bug was reported by Pengfei Wang, the fix addresses a specific commit, and it has been reviewed and tested by other individuals.

5. The patch is concise and focused: The changes in the patch are limited to the relevant code section, ensuring that it only addresses the specific bug without introducing unnecessary modifications.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to meet the criteria for acceptance in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a trivial fix that addresses a merge error and initializes a missing variable. This fix does not seem to address any real and critical bug that causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, security issues, or any other significant issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in block/blk-ioc.c.

2. The current implementation uses a double lock dancing technique, which can be simplified by using trylock on the queue_lock and backing out from the ioc lock on trylock failure.

3. The patch removes the variable "last_q" and replaces it with "q" to represent the request_queue.

4. Inside the while loop, the patch checks if it can acquire the queue_lock using spin_trylock(). If successful, it calls ioc_exit_icq() and releases the lock using spin_unlock(). If not successful, it releases the ioc lock, performs a CPU relax, and then acquires the ioc lock again using spin_lock_irqsave_nested().

5. After the while loop, the patch releases the ioc lock using spin_unlock_irqrestore().

6. Finally, the patch frees the memory using kmem_cache_free().

Based on the analysis, this patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary lock dancing and replaces it with a more straightforward approach using trylock. It does not introduce any trivial fixes and does not seem to have any negative impact on the functionality or introduce any new bugs.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to event processing delay and potential data halt and disconnection on the AP interface. The patch requeues work after the scan is complete for all VIF types, ensuring that event processing is not delayed for the AP interface when it coexists with a STA.

Considering the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption and disconnection, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect behavior in the btrfs_page_exists_in_range function.
2. The bug can cause the function to return false, indicating that there are no pages in the specified range, even though there might be at least one page.
3. The function is used to prevent races in hole punching and lock_extent_direct operations, where it is crucial to ensure the absence of pages in certain ranges.
4. The bug occurs when the start and end indices are below the 16TiB boundary and the high bits of the end index get trimmed due to the incorrect use of the int type.
5. The bug can result in unexpected failures and potentially lead to stale data reads.
6. The patch fixes the issue by using the correct types (unsigned long) for the page indices, ensuring that the high bits are not trimmed.

Considering the critical nature of the bug and the potential impact on data integrity and security, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue in the KVM virtual interrupt controller (vgic) code for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses a problem where the active state of an interrupt is checked incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior when external inputs need to access the state of a virtual interrupt.

2. Impact:
   The patch addresses a bug that can cause incorrect behavior in the handling of virtual interrupts. While the patch does not explicitly mention any specific negative consequences, it implies that the incorrect behavior can lead to issues with external inputs, such as the architected timer code.

3. Reported-by, Acked-by, and Signed-off-by:
   The patch includes information about the person who reported the issue, as well as individuals who have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug that can potentially cause incorrect behavior in the handling of virtual interrupts. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a memory leak issue in the HID multitouch driver. The patch addresses the fact that `mt_free_input_name()` was never called during the `.remove()` function, leading to a memory leak of the allocated names.

The patch restores the original name before freeing it to avoid accessing an already freed pointer. It also updates the `mt_free_input_name()` function to correctly handle the freeing of the input name.

Considering that this patch fixes a real bug (memory leak) and does not contain any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch aims to fix an issue where allocating new chunks fails when considering missing devices. It explains that the current code allocates new chunks based on the number of writable devices and missing devices to ensure that RAID levels on a degraded file system are honored. However, this approach prevents the allocation of new chunks when there are not enough writable devices available. The patch proposes to fix this by ignoring the number of missing devices when allocating new chunks.

2. Code Changes:
   The patch modifies two functions: `btrfs_reduce_alloc_profile` and `update_block_group_flags`. In both functions, the code that adds the count of missing devices to the number of writable devices is removed. Instead, only the number of writable devices is used.

3. Analysis:
   Based on the patch description and code changes, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to allocating new chunks in a degraded file system. By ignoring the number of missing devices, the patch ensures that new chunks can be allocated even when there are not enough writable devices available. This fix does not seem to introduce any trivial changes like spelling or whitespace modifications.

Considering the above analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a real and critical bug related to chunk allocation in degraded file systems.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address two issues:

1. Allowing the media manager to be initialized without a storage backend for device drivers like null_blk.
2. Fixing incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk, specifically the get/set bad block interface.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze each change:

1. The first change modifies the null_lnvm_id function in drivers/block/null_blk.c. It updates the id->cap value from 0x3 to 0x2. This change does not fix a critical bug or address any of the specified issues. It seems to be a trivial fix, possibly a configuration change. Therefore, this change does not meet the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. (NAK)

2. The second change modifies the nvm_register function in drivers/lightnvm/core.c. It adds a conditional check to ensure that the device supports the get/set bad block interface before attempting to initialize the media manager. This change addresses the issue of incorrect configuration of capabilities in null_blk and prevents unnecessary initialization attempts for devices that do not support the required interface. This change seems to fix a real issue and meets the criteria for acceptance in a stable release. (ACK)

Based on the analysis of the patch, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases with the exception of the first change in null_blk.c.

Therefore, I would classify this patch as a "trivial" fix and it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs filesystem. The patch ensures that the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set earlier, before the inode hash table lock is dropped. It also modifies the find actor function to use only the location objectid for matching inodes.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch addresses a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to incorrect search results in the inode hash table due to the race condition. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue in the mtk_tx_map() function in the mediatek Ethernet driver. The patch corrects a copy & paste error by using the correct descriptor pointer when looking up the tx_buffer in the error path.

Since this patch addresses a specific bug and does not contain any trivial fixes, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to optimize the irq restore process for the s390 architecture. Let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

1. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h` file.
   - It adds a new macro `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` which represents the enabled state of interrupts.
   - This macro is used in the subsequent changes.

2. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h` file.
   - It modifies the `arch_local_irq_restore` function to check if the `flags` parameter indicates a transition from disabled to enabled interrupts.
   - If the transition is valid, it calls `arch_local_irq_enable()` to enable interrupts.

3. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/include/asm/irqflags.h` file.
   - It modifies the `arch_irqs_disabled_flags` function to use the `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` macro instead of a hardcoded value.

4. The patch modifies the `arch/s390/mm/init.c` file.
   - It replaces the call to `arch_local_irq_restore` with a call to `__arch_local_irq_stosm` with the value `0x04`.
   - This change directly sets the interrupt state to disabled->disabled using the faster `stosm` instruction.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch optimizes the irq restore process by using the faster `stosm` instruction instead of the slower `ssm` instruction. It also adds checks to ensure that the transition from disabled to enabled interrupts is valid before enabling interrupts.

Considering that this patch improves performance and does not introduce any trivial changes, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to interrupt flags on the Rx LL2 in the qed driver.

2. The problem is that the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

3. The patch fixes this issue by passing a pointer to the lock_flags variable to qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() and qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() functions, allowing them to update the flags correctly.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real and critical bug that can lead to incorrect interrupt status. It does not contain any trivial fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit b0d0d915, which removed the BKL (Big Kernel Lock) in the ipx module.
2. The regression causes a deadlock scenario in the mars-nwe (NetWare emulator) where the ncpserv process reads a request using recvmsg and then forks and spawns nwconn. Subsequently, ncpserv calls a blocking recvmsg and waits for new requests, while nwconn deadlocks in sendmsg on the same socket.
3. The commit b0d0d915 replaced the BKL locking with lock_sock/release_sock, but it did not handle the scenario where a blocking recvmsg would block a concurrent sendmsg.
4. The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while working with the socket data and releases it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram().
5. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags.

Based on the analysis, this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a deadlock scenario, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a specific issue related to the numa task selection process. The patch aims to avoid selecting oneself as a swap target, which can lead to issues when trying to acquire the same lock twice for the swap migrate.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not appear to fix a critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any other significant issue. It seems to be more of an optimization or improvement rather than a fix for a critical problem.

Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a bug related to the contamination of the percpu pointer with the DEAD flag. The patch proposes to update the __ref_is_percpu() function to test both the ATOMIC and DEAD flags before returning the percpu pointer.

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, this patch appears to fix a real and critical bug that could potentially lead to data corruption. It does not seem to contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the code block responsible for checking the minimum length of I/O requests has been removed. The comment suggests that the restriction on I/O smaller than the file system block size or not aligned to it is being lifted.

Considering the information provided, it seems that this patch is addressing a real issue where recent Linux clients send GETLAYOUT requests with minlength less than the block size. The patch also references an observed indefinite hang on fsx runs on some clients due to this issue.

Given that the patch addresses a critical bug causing hangs and aligns with the specifications outlined in RFC 5661, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue where partitions added by user space to the loop device were not being cleaned up after detaching the loop device.

2. The patch replaces the use of BLKRRPART with code that unconditionally cleans up partitions on detach.

3. The patch also exports the delete_partition() function, which was modified by Jens Axboe.

4. In the loop_clr_fd() function in drivers/block/loop.c, the patch removes the BLKRRPART ioctl call and instead removes all partitions manually using the delete_partition() function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch fixes a real and critical bug related to cleaning up partitions when detaching the loop device. It does not contain any trivial fixes and addresses a potential data corruption issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its purpose and impact.

The patch addresses a bug related to reading a maximally sized remote attribute when CRCs are enabled. The bug causes a verification error, specifically "remote attribute header does not match required off/len/owner." The patch provides two fixes for this issue.

The first fix addresses the incorrect calculation of the mapped length, which does not take into account CRC headers. The patch modifies the calculation to directly use the value length, ensuring the correct length is used.

The second fix addresses the byte count of valid data within a buffer. Currently, it is capped by the length of the data and does not consider the possibility of longer buffers due to headers. The patch calculates the data space in the buffer before determining the actual byte count of data.

Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch fixes a real and critical bug that can lead to a verification error and incorrect attribute reading. It does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to increase the output resolution of the fam15h_power hardware monitoring driver.

2. It addresses an issue where on high CPU load, the accumulating values in the running_avg_cap register are very low, leading to poor output resolution.

3. The patch modifies the calculation of the running_avg_range by incrementing it by 1.

4. The patch also modifies the calculation of curr_pwr_watts by shifting the tdp_limit and data->base_tdp by the running_avg_range and subtracting the running_avg_capture.

5. Finally, the patch adjusts the conversion of curr_pwr_watts by shifting it by (10 + running_avg_range).

Based on the analysis, this patch does not fix a real and critical bug that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or any "oh, that's not good" issue. It appears to be a performance improvement patch that increases the output resolution of the fam15h_power driver.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific bug related to out-of-bounds memory accesses in the nouveau_fbcon_init() function. The bug report and the commit message indicate that the issue causes an oops when loading the nouveau module with a GTX 780 Ti video adapter.

The patch itself adds a null check before accessing the fbdev structure, ensuring that the assignment to fbcon->helper.fbdev->pixmap.buf_align is only performed if fbcon->helper.fbdev is not null.

Considering the patch addresses a specific bug that can lead to an oops, it can be categorized as fixing a critical issue. Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. Patch Description: The patch is titled "media: tda10071: fix returned symbol rate calculation" and indicates that the detected symbol rate value was returned too small.

2. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed off by Antti Palosaari and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

3. Code Changes: The patch modifies the code in the tda10071_get_frontend function in the tda10071.c file.

   - Line 860: The original code assigns the symbol rate value by combining the values of buf[0], buf[1], and buf[2].
   - The modified code multiplies the combined value by 1000.

Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch fixes a bug related to the symbol rate calculation in the tda10071 driver. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the severity of the bug or whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in a stable release.

To make an informed decision, I would need additional information such as the impact of the bug, whether it causes build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or poses a security risk. Additionally, I would need to assess whether the fix is non-trivial and does not contain any unnecessary changes.

Please provide more details about the bug and its impact, and I will be able to give a more accurate recommendation.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch disables the forced PORTS_IMPL for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3.
2. It explains that some early controllers incorrectly reported zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register, and the ahci driver fabricated PORTS_IMPL based on the number of ports in those cases.
3. With the new nvme controllers, there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should be honored.
4. The patch disables the workaround for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to incorrect reporting of zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register. It is not a trivial fix, as it involves disabling a workaround for certain AHCI versions. However, it does not explicitly mention any critical bugs, build errors, oops, hangs, data corruption, or security issues.

Considering the criteria for accepting patches in Linux -stable releases, this patch does not seem to meet the requirements. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "drm/radeon: handle non-VGA class pci devices with ATRM". It suggests an update to the ATRM fetch method in order to handle newer PX systems with non-VGA pci class dGPUs.

2. The patch references a bug report in the Linux kernel bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75401). This indicates that there is a real bug that needs to be addressed.

3. The patch is signed-off by Alex Deucher and Christian König, who are both recognized contributors to the Linux kernel.

4. The patch includes changes to the radeon_atrm_get_bios() function in the radeon_bios.c file.

5. The added code block checks for non-VGA class pci devices by iterating through the devices with the PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_OTHER class. It attempts to retrieve the ACPI handle for each device and checks if the "ATRM" handle exists. If found, it sets the "found" flag to true.

6. If no VGA class pci devices are found and the "found" flag remains false, the function returns false.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a real bug and introduces a necessary update to handle non-VGA class pci devices with ATRM. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a specific issue related to GPU hangs on certain machines when large amounts of text scroll in an xterm. The patch disables semaphores on Sandy Bridge (SNB) while leaving them enabled for Ivy Bridge (IVB).

Considering the criteria for accepting a patch in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch:

1. Does it fix a real and critical bug? Yes, it addresses GPU hangs, which can be considered a critical issue.

2. Does it cause a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue? Yes, GPU hangs can be considered a "oh, that's not good" issue.

3. Does it contain any "trivial" fixes (spelling changes, whitespace cleanups, etc)? No, the patch focuses on disabling semaphores on SNB.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a real and critical bug without any trivial fixes.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a critical bug that could potentially lead to a system crash. The patch addresses a double-free bug that occurs when a new beacon cannot be obtained from mac80211, resulting in a system crash on the next beacon transmission attempt.

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause a system crash, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Additionally, the patch does not contain any trivial fixes such as spelling changes or whitespace cleanups, which aligns with the criteria for acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a real and critical bug related to data corruption in the spi-ti-qspi driver. The bug occurs when spi_finalize_current_message() is called before terminating the transfer at the hardware side, which can lead to overlapping transactions and data corruption.

The patch addresses this issue by moving the command to terminate the transfer to before calling spi_finalize_current_message().

Considering that the patch fixes a real and critical bug that can cause data corruption, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
