This patch fixes a bug in the xmon data-breakpoint feature in the powerpc architecture. Currently, when a watchpoint match occurs, the hw_breakpoint_handler is called but it does not find any associated perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. This causes the xmon breakpoint handler to not be notified.

The patch solves this issue by returning NOTIFY_DONE when hw_breakpoint_handler does not find any perf_event associated with the matched watchpoint. This ensures that the core code continues calling the other breakpoint handlers, including the xmon one.

The patch has been reviewed and tested, and it is a bug fix that improves the functionality of the xmon data-breakpoint feature. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: 

The patch removes the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the clk-44xx.c, clk-54xx.c, and clk-7xx.c files in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 clock driver. This is necessary because when the gpmc.c file calls clk_get(..., "fck"), it gets a dummy clock with a rate configured to zero. This results in divisions by zero and misconfigured timings, causing devices on the bus to be lost. By removing the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock, gpmc.c can fail gracefully.

The patch has been Acked-by Tero Kristo <t-kristo@ti.com> and Signed-off-by Florian Vaussard <florian.vaussard@epfl.ch> and Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>. It is also marked for stable releases from v3.14 onwards.

This patch adds a check to ensure that a guest which sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value will receive a #GP (General Protection) exception. Currently, if the vmx (Virtual Machine Extensions) supports loading the PAT CR during entry, the value is not checked. This patch adds the necessary check in that case.

The patch modifies the vmx_set_msr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c to call the kvm_mtrr_valid function to check the validity of the PAT CR value. If the value is invalid, the function returns 1, indicating that the patch should not be accepted.

The patch also adds the kvm_mtrr_valid function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c to check the validity of the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values. This function is used by the set_msr_mtrr function to check the validity of the MTRR values. The kvm_mtrr_valid function returns true if the values are valid.

Finally, the patch adds the kvm_mtrr_valid function declaration in arch/x86/kvm/x86.h.

Overall, this patch adds necessary checks to ensure that invalid values for the PAT CR and MTRR are not accepted. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Explanation: The patch fixes a bug in the btrfs file system where fs_info->pending_changes is never cleared. The original code uses cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0), which only clears it if pending_changes is already 0. This can cause problems when mounting btrfs with the inode_cache mount option, as pending_changes will always be 1 even when the file system is frozen. The patch replaces cmpxchg with xchg to ensure that fs_info->pending_changes is always cleared. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers.
true || ACK

Explanation: The patch adds a check to skip adding PWM fan control attributes if DPM (Dynamic Power Management) is disabled. Since PWM fan control is only available with DPM, there is no non-DPM support on amdgpu. Therefore, the sysfs nodes for PWM fan control attributes would never be created if DPM is disabled. The patch adds the check as an extra precaution to avoid any potential crashes. This change does not affect the functionality of the driver when DPM is enabled. Hence, it is safe to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

Explanation: 

The patch fixes a WARNING of "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" that is triggered during unloading block driver. The patch removes the unnecessary freezing and unfreezing of the queue in blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() function. Since the queue has already been freezed by blk_cleanup_queue(), there is no need to freeze it again before deleting the tag set. This change improves the code by removing redundant operations and fixes the warning.

This patch fixes a bug in the bcm_sysport_resume() function where a UniMAC reset was missing after coming out of a suspend cycle. This can lead to receive FIFO corruptions and duplicated/corrupted packets being delivered to the host CPU interface. The patch adds the missing UniMAC reset, ensuring that the RX FIFO is properly reset and preventing the delivery of corrupted packets.

The patch also includes a fix for a specific scenario where the issue could be reproduced on a crowded network with Wake-on-LAN enabled for the interface. In this scenario, the switch still forwards packets to the host CPU interface, and leaving the UniMAC RX enable bit on allows matching MagicPackets. However, during the resume function, there is a small window where the UniMAC receive is still enabled, but the RDMA and RBUF engines are not ready. This leads to packets getting stuck in the UniMAC RX FIFO and ultimately delivered as corrupted. The patch addresses this issue by resetting the UniMAC during the resume function, ensuring that packets are properly queued and avoiding the delivery of corrupted packets.

The patch includes a Fixes tag referencing the commit that introduced the suspend and resume support for the systemport driver, indicating that this patch is fixing a bug introduced in that commit.

The patch has been signed-off by the relevant authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on the provided information, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

This patch adds a check to the try_ram_remap() function in the memremap code to ensure that the PFN passed to pfn_to_page() is valid before dereferencing it. This is important because on some architectures, such as ARM and arm64, the 'System RAM' iomem region may include regions for which pfn_valid() returns false.

By adding this check, the patch ensures that both __va() and pfn_to_page() are only called on PFNs/physical addresses for which pfn_valid() returns true. This improves the reliability and correctness of the code.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Explanation: 

This patch fixes a bug in the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() functions where the use count of md5sig_pool is increased for each tcp md5sig peer. However, tcp_v4_clear_md5_list() assumes that multiple tcp md5sig peers only hold one reference to md5sig_pool. This can lead to memory leaks and incorrect behavior.

The patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first tcp md5sig peer. Additionally, it adds checks to free md5sig_pool if there are no entries for md5sig_info.

This patch is necessary to ensure proper handling of md5sig_pool references and prevent memory leaks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

This patch fixes a locking regression in the ipx_sendmsg and ipx_recvmsg functions. The regression was introduced by commit b0d0d915, which removed the BKL (Big Kernel Lock) and replaced it with lock_sock/release_sock. However, this change caused a blocking recvmsg syscall to block a concurrent sendmsg syscall on the same socket.

The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while actually working with the socket data and release it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram(). This ensures that a blocking recvmsg does not block a concurrent sendmsg.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Jiri Bohac and Arnd Bergmann. It has also been signed-off by David S. Miller, the maintainer of the net/ipx/af_ipx.c file.
