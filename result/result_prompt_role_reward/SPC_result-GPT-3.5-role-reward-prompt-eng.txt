false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use PCI Express Capability access functions to simplify the ath9k driver.

2. The patch removes the usage of the `pci_pcie_cap` function and replaces it with the `pcie_capability_clear_word` and `pcie_capability_read_word` functions.

3. The patch also removes the usage of `pci_read_config_byte` and `pci_write_config_byte` functions and replaces them with `pcie_capability_clear_word` and `pcie_capability_read_word` functions.

4. The patch checks if the device is a PCI Express device using the `is_pciexpress` field of the `ath_hw` structure. If it is not a PCI Express device, the function returns without making any changes.

5. If the device is a PCI Express device and Bluetooth coexistence is enabled, the patch clears the ASPM (Active State Power Management) settings for both the device and its parent device using the `pcie_capability_clear_word` function.

6. If Bluetooth coexistence is not enabled, the patch reads the ASPM settings from the parent device using the `pcie_capability_read_word` function and checks if L0s or L1 states are enabled. If they are enabled, the `aspm_enabled` field of the `ath_hw` structure is set to true.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch simplifies the code by using PCI Express Capability access functions and ensures consistent ASPM settings for the device and its parent device. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a straightforward addition of a wrapper function for the `device_tx_status` callback in the `dmaengine` subsystem. This wrapper function simplifies the code and improves readability for users of the `device_tx_status` function.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the function `vlv_infoframe_enabled` in the `intel_hdmi.c` file of the `i915` driver. The function is responsible for checking if the infoframe is enabled for a given encoder.

The patch introduces a new variable `intel_dig_port` of type `struct intel_digital_port` and initializes it with the value of `enc_to_dig_port(encoder)`. This variable represents the digital port associated with the encoder.

Next, the patch adds a new variable `port` and assigns it the value of `intel_dig_port->port`. This variable represents the port associated with the digital port.

The patch then modifies the return statement of the function. It checks if the `port` matches the port value obtained from the register `VIDEO_DIP_PORT_MASK` and if so, it returns the result of the bitwise AND operation between `val` and `VIDEO_DIP_ENABLE`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a necessary check to ensure that the infoframe is enabled only for the correct port. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `sch_generic.c` file in the `net/sched` directory. It introduces a change in the behavior of handling the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag.

The patch adds a condition `!(dev->priv_flags & IFF_NO_QUEUE)` to the existing condition `if (dev->tx_queue_len)` in the `attach_one_default_qdisc` function. This change ensures that the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is considered as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero when selecting the default qdisc.

Similarly, the patch modifies the condition in the `attach_default_qdiscs` function to include the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag as a condition for attaching the default qdiscs.

Overall, the patch allows the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag to be used as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero when selecting the default qdisc. This change seems reasonable and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

This change is made to ensure uniformity and compatibility with device tree (DT) usage.

The patch modifies the `__ae_match` function to compare the `fwnode_handle` instead of the `device_node`. Similarly, the `find_ae` function is updated to accept a `fwnode_handle` parameter instead of `device_node`. The `hnae_get_handle` function is also modified to use `fwnode_handle` instead of `device_node`.

In addition, the `hns_nic_priv` structure is updated to include a `fwnode_handle` pointer instead of a `device_node` pointer.

Overall, this patch seems to be a necessary change to ensure consistency and compatibility with device tree usage. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the check for `dst == NULL` in the `ip6t_SYNPROXY` module is unnecessary. The patch suggests removing this check and only checking `dst->error` instead. 

Since `ip6_route_output()` is guaranteed to never return a NULL pointer, the check for `dst == NULL` is redundant and can be safely removed. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the clocksource driver for the sh_tmu platform to use the clockevents_config() and clockevents_config_and_register() helpers, which are now exported. This is a good practice as it ensures the driver is using the recommended APIs.

2. The patch removes the TODO comment related to calculating the shift from rate and counter bit width. This suggests that the necessary calculations have been implemented or are no longer required.

3. The clockevents_config() function is used to configure the clock event device (ced) with the provided rate. This ensures that the clock event device is properly configured.

4. The clockevents_config_and_register() function is used to configure and register the clock event device. It takes additional parameters for the min_delta_ns and max_delta_ns values. This ensures that the clock event device is properly registered with the specified parameters.

5. The patch also includes a dev_info() call to provide information about the clock event device being used for clock events.

Overall, the patch appears to be a clean and necessary update to the clocksource driver for the sh_tmu platform. It resolves a long-standing TODO item and ensures the driver is using the recommended APIs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is modifying the drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16209_trigger.c and drivers/staging/iio/accel/adis16240_trigger.c files. The patch replaces the existing event handler functions adis16209_data_rdy_trig_poll() and adis16240_data_rdy_trig_poll() with the iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function.

The iio_trigger_generic_data_rdy_poll() function is a generic function provided by the IIO (Industrial I/O) framework for handling data ready triggers. It is a recommended approach for handling data ready triggers in IIO drivers.

Considering this information, it seems that the patch is improving the code by using a standardized function for handling data ready triggers. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the variable "npend" is not initialized before being used in the function "ath9k_has_tx_pending" in the file "drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/main.c". This results in a warning during compilation.

To fix this issue, the patch initializes the variable "npend" to 0 before the loop in the "ath9k_has_tx_pending" function.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a potential issue of using an uninitialized variable, which could lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the code. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and Acked by Felix Fietkau and signed-off by Geert Uytterhoeven and John W. Linville, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and does not take into account any potential conflicts or dependencies with other parts of the Linux kernel codebase.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called `calibration_delay_done()`. This function is intended to be used by architectures to indicate that the CPU delay calibration is done and to stop accepting delay timer registrations after this point.

2. The function `calibration_delay_done()` is marked as weak, which means it can be overridden by architecture-specific implementations if needed.

3. The patch also includes the necessary function declaration and implementation for `calibration_delay_done()`.

4. The patch modifies the `calibrate_delay()` function to call `calibration_delay_done()` after the delay calibration is performed.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the condition `if (oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID)` and the corresponding `LASSERT` check. The reason for removing this condition is that it is redundant. The previous check `(oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID) == 0` already ensures that `(oa->o_valid & OBD_MD_FLID)` is always true after that point.

By removing this redundant check, the code becomes cleaner and more concise. It also eliminates unnecessary code execution, which can improve performance.

The patch has been reviewed and tested by Dan Carpenter, who reported the issue, and Oleg Drokin, who made the changes. It has also been signed-off by Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted maintainer.

Therefore, considering the removal of redundant code and the positive reviews, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward removal of unused #defines in the IOAT driver. Since these #defines are not being used anywhere in the code, removing them should not have any impact on the functionality or stability of the driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch replaces the usage of `device_schedule_callback()` with `device_remove_file_self()` in the `sdev_store_delete()` function. The reason for this change is that the driver-core now supports synchronous self-deletion of attributes, and the asynchronous removal mechanism is scheduled for removal.

The `sdev_store_delete()` function is responsible for handling the deletion of a device attribute. Previously, it used `device_schedule_callback()` to schedule the deletion asynchronously. However, with this patch, it directly calls `device_remove_file_self()` and then immediately removes the SCSI device using `scsi_remove_device()`.

This change makes the "delete" behavior synchronous, ensuring that the attribute is deleted immediately without relying on a callback mechanism. It simplifies the code and aligns with the current best practices in the driver-core.

Given that the patch improves the code by using the recommended synchronous deletion mechanism, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a cleanup patch with no functional changes. It removes an unnecessary forward declaration and does not introduce any new code or modify existing functionality.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a local variable called "handle" of type "acpi_handle" to store the value of "device->handle". This change improves the readability and maintainability of the code by reducing the repetition of "device->handle" throughout the function.

2. The patch replaces "device->handle" with the newly introduced "handle" variable in multiple places within the function. This change ensures consistency and improves code clarity.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify the existing logic. It only improves the code by introducing a local variable for better expression economy.

Overall, the patch seems to be a clean and straightforward improvement without any potential negative impact. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a missing `platform_device_put` function call in the error path of the `raumfeld_audio_init` function.

The purpose of the `platform_device_put` function is to release the reference count of a platform device, allowing it to be properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed. In this case, if the `platform_device_add` function fails (returns a negative value), the patch ensures that the `raumfeld_audio_device` is properly released before returning the error code.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a potential resource leak, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding interrupt resources for McASPs on the ARM Davinci DM646x platform. The interrupts are named "tx" and "rx" and have corresponding IRQ numbers.

The patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary fix to prevent a potential kernel panic. It does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could cause regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding a new function called `dce_v10_0_check_soft_reset` to the `dce_v10_0_ip_funcs` structure in the `dce_v10_0.c` file of the AMDGPU driver. This function checks if the display is hung and updates the `hang` status of the DCE IP block accordingly.

Considering the purpose of the patch and the fact that it does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing code, it seems to be a reasonable addition. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward constification of the `drm_proc_list` array and related pointers in the `drm_proc.c` file. The patch adds the `const` qualifier to the `drm_proc_list` array and modifies the function signatures of `drm_proc_create_files` and `drm_proc_remove_files` to accept `const` pointers to `drm_info_list`.

Given that this patch only introduces constification and does not modify any existing functionality, it can be considered a safe change. Constifying variables can help improve code readability and prevent accidental modifications.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the wacom_raw_event() function in the hid-wacom.c file. The purpose of the patch is to move the check for the Graphire report header to a more appropriate location. The current check is valid only for Wacom Graphire devices, as their reports always start with 0x03. However, the patch acknowledges that Intuos4 WL high-speed reports begin with 0x04, so the existing check would incorrectly filter out valid reports.

The patch introduces a conditional statement that checks if the device is a Wacom Graphire Bluetooth device. If it is, the patch then checks if the report header is 0x03. If the condition is met, the patch calls the wacom_gr_parse_report() function to parse the report. If the condition is not met, the patch logs an error message and returns 0.

This change ensures that the check for the report header is only applied to the appropriate device, preventing valid reports from being filtered out for other devices.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Ping Cheng <pingc@wacom.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a relevant maintainer.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "staging: lustre: fix socklnd issues found by Klocwork Insight tool." This suggests that the patch aims to fix issues identified by the Klocwork Insight tool in the socklnd module of the Lustre staging driver.

2. The patch includes a fix for a null pointer issue. It mentions that a null pointer 'best_iface' that comes from line 802 may be dereferenced at line 832.

3. The patch adds a check for the null pointer 'best_iface' at line 804 using the LASSERT macro. This check ensures that 'best_iface' is not null before it is used.

4. At line 838, another LASSERT macro is added to check the validity of 'best_iface' before it is used again.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to a null pointer dereference in the socklnd module of the Lustre staging driver. The added LASSERT checks help ensure that 'best_iface' is not null before it is used, thereby preventing potential crashes or undefined behavior.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function called `tpic2810_set` which is used to set the output level of the GPIO pin.
2. The `tpic2810_direction_output` function is modified to call `tpic2810_set` with the provided `value` parameter. This ensures that the proper output level is set for the GPIO pin.
3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior of the driver. It only improves the implementation by setting the output level correctly.
4. The patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Axel Lin and Linus Walleij, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the `gpio-tpic2810` driver and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies three files: `ip_set_bitmap_gen.h`, `ip_set_hash_gen.h`, and `ip_set_list_set.c`. In each file, there are two changes made:

1. The line `ipset_nest_end(skb, adt);` or `ipset_nest_end(skb, atd);` is moved after the error handling code block, specifically after the `return` statement.

The purpose of `ipset_nest_end()` is to end a nested attribute in a netlink message. By moving this line after the error handling code block, it ensures that the nested attribute is properly closed even in case of an error. This change improves the error handling and prevents potential resource leaks.

2. The `nla_nest_cancel()` function is called before `ipset_nest_end()`.

The `nla_nest_cancel()` function cancels the current nested attribute, which is useful when an error occurs during the creation of a nested attribute. By calling this function before `ipset_nest_end()`, it ensures that any partially created nested attribute is properly canceled before ending the attribute.

Overall, these changes improve the error handling and ensure proper cleanup in case of errors. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a crash issue in the acpi_power_meter driver. Currently, the driver crashes the kernel if it encounters unexpected events or internal implementation errors. The proposed change replaces the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, which allows the kernel to continue execution instead of crashing.

The patch modifies three sections of code in the acpi_power_meter.c file. In each section, the BUG() macro is replaced with the WARN() macro, which prints an error message indicating the unexpected condition or implementation error. Additionally, a break statement is added after the WARN() macro to prevent further execution of the switch statement.

By replacing the BUG() macro with the WARN() macro, the patch ensures that the kernel does not crash unnecessarily and provides more informative error messages. This change is considered safe and does not introduce any new risks or regressions.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch is signed-off by Andy Grover <agrover@redhat.com> and Nicholas Bellinger <nab@linux-iscsi.org>, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

3. In the code changes, the line `char buf[16];` is replaced with `char buf[] = "rd_pages=8,rd_nullio=1";`. This change initializes the `buf` array with the desired configuration parameters for the nullio device.

4. The `memset` and `sprintf` calls that were previously used to set the `buf` array to "rd_pages=8" have been removed since the desired configuration parameters are already provided in the initialization.

5. The `hba->transport->set_configfs_dev_params(dev, buf, sizeof(buf));` line sets the configuration parameters for the nullio device using the `buf` array.

6. Finally, the `target_configure_device(dev);` function is called to configure the device.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary change to make virtual_lun0 a nullio device. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals, and the code changes seem appropriate. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes are related to making the `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs` arrays constant. The patch also updates the declaration of the arrays, as well as the `find_freq_tables()` and its callsites.

Considering that the arrays `pxa255_run_freqs` and `pxa255_turbo_freqs` are only read and not modified, making them constant is a reasonable change. This helps improve code clarity and potentially allows for better compiler optimizations.

Additionally, the patch updates the function signatures of `pxa_cpufreq_change_voltage()` and `find_freq_tables()` to use `const` pointers for the `pxa_freqs` parameter. This change ensures that the passed `pxa_freqs` data is not modified within these functions, which is a good practice for maintaining code integrity.

Overall, the changes in this patch seem reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the `I2CR` and `I2CW` macros from the `s626.c` file in the `drivers/staging/comedi` directory. These macros are used to expand the I2C read and write addresses, respectively. They are only used in one place each and include the name of a local variable `devpriv` in their expansion.

The patch replaces the usage of the `I2CR` macro with the expanded value of `devpriv->I2CAdrs | 1` and replaces the usage of the `I2CW` macro with the expanded value of `devpriv->I2CAdrs`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary macros and expanding them in place. This change does not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of the code. Therefore, it can be considered a clean-up or refactoring change.

2. The implementation of `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()` reads the register value corresponding to the GPIO pin's direction using the `pca953x_read_single()` function. It then checks the bit corresponding to the GPIO pin in the register value and returns the direction (input or output) accordingly.

3. The patch also updates the `gpio_chip` structure initialization in the `pca953x_setup_gpio()` function to assign the new `gc->get_direction` callback to `pca953x_gpio_get_direction()`. This ensures that the new functionality is properly integrated into the driver.

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch adds a long-awaited feature to the `gpio-pca953x` driver, providing a way to retrieve the direction of a GPIO pin. It appears to be well-implemented and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses build errors on device drivers with tristate Kconfig options when using custom initcall levels. Instead of adding ifdeffery into the drivers, the patch adds the missing initcall_sync variants. This fix is necessary to ensure proper functionality and compatibility.

2. The patch also updates the comment in init.h to clarify the valid use cases for custom initcall levels. It mentions that while most drivers should use regular module_init, there are still valid cases where custom initcall levels are needed, such as for bus snooping debug drivers or drivers implementing Linux frameworks like pinctrl.

3. The patch is signed-off by Tony Lindgren and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or behavior. They only provide missing initcall_sync variants and update the comment for clarity.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds two WARN_ON statements to the code. WARN_ON is a macro that generates a warning message if the given condition evaluates to true. In this case, the conditions are related to the hardware compatibility of the Intel graphics driver (i915) with specific CPU types.

2. The first WARN_ON statement checks if the CPU is not an ULT (Ultra Low TDP) CPU when the LynxPoint PCH (Platform Controller Hub) is detected. ULT CPUs are a specific type of CPU architecture, and the warning is triggered if the detected PCH is not paired with an ULT CPU.

3. The second WARN_ON statement checks if the CPU is not an ULT CPU when the LynxPoint LP (Low Power) PCH is detected. Similar to the first warning, this warning is triggered if the detected LP PCH is not paired with an ULT CPU.

4. The purpose of these warnings is to ensure that the correct combination of CPU and PCH is used, as there may be compatibility issues or performance limitations when using mismatched combinations.

5. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

The patch modifies the conditional logic in the `visornic_init()` function of the `visornic_main.c` file in the staging/unisys/visornic directory. 

Before the patch, the code checks if the `visorbus_register_visor_driver()` function returns a success code. If it does, the function returns 0, indicating success. However, if the function returns an error code, it does nothing and continues execution.

After the patch, the code checks if the `visorbus_register_visor_driver()` function returns an error code. If it does, it jumps to the `cleanup_debugfs` label, indicating a failure. Otherwise, it continues execution.

This change ensures that the function handles errors correctly by checking for an error code instead of a success code. It improves the code's reliability and maintainability.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it suggests replacing the use of `pr_err` with `dev_err` in the `cpsw_probe_dt` function of the `cpsw.c` file in the `drivers/net/ethernet/ti` directory. 

The `pr_err` function is used to print an error message to the kernel log, while the `dev_err` function is used to print an error message associated with a specific device. 

Considering this change, it is generally a good practice to use `dev_err` instead of `pr_err` when reporting errors related to a specific device. This change improves the clarity of error messages and helps in identifying the source of the error.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, the memset call is redundant and can be safely removed.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for reading from a video device if the camera bus driver supports it. This is a useful feature as it allows users to read data from the video device, enhancing the functionality of the camera driver.

2. The patch includes a debug line, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

3. The patch checks if the camera bus driver supports the "init_videobuf2" operation and if the video device supports reading (VB2_READ). If both conditions are met, the patch uses the "vb2_read" function to read data from the video device. This ensures that the reading operation is only performed if it is supported by the driver and the device.

4. If the camera device does not support reading or the "init_videobuf2" operation, the patch returns an error (-EINVAL) and logs an error message. This ensures that the reading operation is not attempted if it is not supported.

Overall, the patch adds a useful feature and handles the reading operation in a safe and controlled manner. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to address a failure in rcutorture's testing of invocations of call_rcu() with interrupts disabled. It adds interrupt disabling using local_irq_disable() before one of the existing invocations of call_rcu() and enables interrupts using local_irq_enable() afterward.

The addition of interrupt disabling and enabling around the call_rcu() invocation allows for testing the behavior of call_rcu() when interrupts are disabled. This is an important aspect to consider as it helps ensure the correctness and robustness of the call_rcu() implementation.

Given that the patch addresses a known issue and improves the testing coverage of call_rcu(), it is reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases.

The patch removes the check for CLK_IS_BASIC in the omap2_clk_deny_idle() and omap2_clk_allow_idle() functions. The comment in the patch states that this check is not doing anything useful and is blocking the removal of the __clk_get_flags() API.

Since the code is never called with a basic clock type, removing this check does not introduce any functional changes or regressions. It simply allows for the removal of the __clk_get_flags() API, which is no longer needed.

The patch has been Acked-by Tero Kristo and Signed-off-by Stephen Boyd, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant developers.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing the `.owner` field for the `a3700_spi_driver` structure in the `spi-armada-3700.c` file. The reason for this removal is to allow calls that automatically set the `.owner` field.

In general, the `.owner` field is used to keep track of the module that owns the driver. By removing it, the ownership tracking mechanism is disabled. This change may be acceptable if there are specific calls in the code that automatically set the `.owner` field correctly.

However, without further context or information about the specific calls that set the `.owner` field automatically, it is difficult to determine the impact of this change. It is important to consider the potential consequences of removing the ownership tracking mechanism.

Therefore, I would recommend further review and testing of this patch before deciding whether to accept it in Linux -stable releases.

This can improve code readability and potentially reduce the risk of bugs related to uninitialized memory.

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The changes made in the patch do not appear to introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It is a straightforward memory allocation improvement.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable and safe improvement to the code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds error handling for panel initialization in the OMAPDSS HDMI driver. This is important because blindly assuming successful panel initialization can lead to issues if the initialization fails.

2. The patch also groups the mutex initialization at a single place, which improves code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch initializes the `lock` member of the `ip_data` structure using `mutex_init()`. This ensures proper initialization of the mutex and avoids potential issues with uninitialized mutexes.

4. The patch calls `hdmi_panel_init()` to initialize the HDMI panel. If the initialization fails (`hdmi_panel_init()` returns a non-zero value), an error message is printed, and the necessary cleanup is performed before returning the error code.

5. The patch adds error handling for panel initialization failure, including releasing the acquired clocks and returning the error code.

Overall, the patch improves error handling and ensures proper initialization of mutexes and the HDMI panel. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch updates the plane state during initialization in the "intel_find_initial_plane_obj" function. This is important for atomic plane updates, as they rely on having an accurate plane_mask.

2. The primary plane's "crtc" and "state->crtc" pointers are updated to point to the "intel_crtc->base" object. This ensures that the plane is associated with the correct CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller).

3. The state of the primary plane's framebuffer ("primary->fb") is updated using the "update_state_fb" function.

4. The "plane_mask" of the "intel_crtc->base.state" is updated to include the primary plane using the "drm_plane_index(primary)" function.

5. In the "intel_modeset_gem_init" function, the primary plane's "crtc" and "state->crtc" pointers are set to NULL, indicating that the plane is not associated with any CRTC.

6. The state of the primary plane's framebuffer is updated again using the "update_state_fb" function.

7. The "plane_mask" of the "c->state" is updated to exclude the primary plane using the "~(1 << drm_plane_index(c->primary))" expression.

Overall, this patch ensures that the plane state is correctly updated during initialization and handles the association and disassociation of the primary plane with the CRTC. It also updates the "plane_mask" appropriately. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the duplicated callback functions in the codec driver and component driver for the wm9713 codec are being addressed. The functions are currently copied from the codec driver to the component driver during register timing, which is considered a quick-hack. The patch aims to move these functions from the codec driver to the component driver.

Considering the patch's purpose of removing duplicated callback functions and improving code organization, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to clean up the handling of the `open_count` variable in the `mac802154_slave_open` and `mac802154_slave_close` functions of the `net/mac802154/iface.c` file.

In the `mac802154_slave_open` function, the patch replaces the increment of `open_count` with a check if it is zero. If `open_count` is zero, it calls `drv_start(local)` and increments `open_count`. This change ensures that `drv_start(local)` is only called once when `open_count` transitions from zero to one.

In the `mac802154_slave_close` function, the patch decrements `open_count` before calling `drv_stop(local)`. It also changes the condition for calling `drv_stop(local)` to check if `open_count` is zero. This ensures that `drv_stop(local)` is only called when `open_count` transitions from one to zero.

Overall, the patch simplifies the logic for handling `open_count` and ensures that the driver start and stop functions are called correctly. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an odd use of WARN_ON() in the srpt_abort_cmd() function in the ib_srpt.c file.
2. The current code uses WARN_ON("ERROR: unexpected command state"), which is not clear in terms of its intent.
3. The patch replaces the existing WARN_ON() with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state), which provides more useful information by showing the "state" value.
4. The change improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message, making it easier to understand and debug unexpected command states.

Overall, the patch improves the code quality and enhances the error reporting in the srpt_abort_cmd() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests adding the __must_check attribute to the declarations of the dvb_usb_generic_rw() and dvb_usb_generic_write() functions in the dvb-usb.h header file. This attribute indicates that the return values of these functions must be checked by the caller.

By adding the __must_check attribute, the patch ensures that the drivers using these functions will handle errors correctly. Without checking the return values, the drivers may not behave as expected in case of errors.

Since this patch improves the reliability and correctness of the drivers, it is advisable to include it in the Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix or improvement for the iio/hid-sensors ALS (Ambient Light Sensor) driver. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze its content and potential impact. 

1. The patch introduces new variables to the `struct als_state`:
   - `scale_pre_decml`: Represents the scale value before the decimal point.
   - `scale_post_decml`: Represents the scale value after the decimal point.
   - `scale_precision`: Represents the precision of the scale value.
   - `value_offset`: Represents the offset value.

2. In the `als_read_raw` function, the patch modifies the behavior of the `IIO_CHAN_INFO_SCALE` case. Instead of returning the `als_illum.units` value, it now returns the `scale_pre_decml`, `scale_post_decml`, and `scale_precision` values.

3. In the `als_read_raw` function, the `IIO_CHAN_INFO_OFFSET` case now returns the `value_offset` value instead of using `hid_sensor_convert_exponent`.

4. In the `als_parse_report` function, the patch adds a call to `hid_sensor_format_scale` to calculate the `scale_precision`, `scale_pre_decml`, and `scale_post_decml` values based on the HID usage and attribute information.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch improves the handling of scale and offset values in the ALS driver. It ensures compliance with the IIO ABI and provides more accurate and precise scale information. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code modification in the staging/iio/adc/mxs-lradc.c file. The patch replaces the existing code for pushing data to the buffer with a new function, iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp(), which also includes the timestamp.

Considering the patch's purpose is to make the code shorter and less ugly, and it has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the fm10k_debugfs.c and fm10k_ethtool.c files. It replaces the use of sprintf() with snprintf() in several places to avoid potential buffer overflow issues.

In the fm10k_debugfs.c file, the sprintf() calls are replaced with snprintf() calls when generating folder and file names for debugfs entries. By using snprintf() with the size of the name buffer, the patch ensures that the buffer is not overflowed.

Similarly, in the fm10k_ethtool.c file, the sprintf() calls are replaced with snprintf() calls when generating strings for statistics names. Again, this change prevents buffer overflow by specifying the size of the destination buffer.

Overall, the patch improves the code's safety by using snprintf() instead of sprintf() to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code cleanup change. The patch removes the unnecessary initialization of two global variables, `ll_remote_perm_cachep` and `ll_rmtperm_hash_cachep`, to NULL. 

Since these variables are already declared as global variables, they will be automatically initialized to NULL by default. Therefore, the explicit initialization to NULL is redundant and can be safely removed.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be categorized as a clean-up or cosmetic change. Such changes are generally accepted in stable releases, as they improve code readability and maintainability without introducing any risks.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering that the patch is adding support for a specific USB device, it seems reasonable to include it in the Linux -stable releases. This would ensure that users of the POD X3 Live can use it with the Linux kernel without any issues.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix or enhancement for the "mfd: arizona" driver in the Linux kernel. The patch allows the CODEC DAPM context to be accessed elsewhere, which is required for integrating with signal sources in the audio portion.

Considering the patch's purpose and the fact that it introduces a new structure member "struct snd_soc_dapm_context *dapm" to the "struct arizona" structure, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). This change allows other device functions to integrate with signal sources in the audio portion, which can be beneficial for various use cases.

6. The patch handles the case where the packet exceeds the MTU by sending an ICMP message and dropping the packet.

7. The patch increments the `IPSTATS_MIB_INHDRERRORS` statistic using the `net` variable instead of `dev_net(skb_dst(skb)->dev)`. This ensures that the correct network namespace is used for statistics tracking.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness and reliability of the `ip_forward` function by correctly computing the network namespace and using it consistently throughout the function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the intention is to make the function `CsrUInt16ToHex` static and move it from `csr_util.c` to `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`. The patch also updates the header file `csr_util.h` to remove the declaration of `CsrUInt16ToHex`.

Considering the changes made, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. The function `CsrUInt16ToHex` is made static, which limits its visibility to only the file it is defined in, reducing the risk of potential conflicts or misuse. Additionally, the patch ensures that the function is only called from `csr_wifi_hip_card_sdio_intr.c`, which suggests that it is specific to that file's functionality.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the btrfs filesystem. The patch modifies the btrfs_add_nondir function to take btrfs_inode instead of the generic inode structure. It also updates the function calls to pass the appropriate btrfs_inode pointers.

2. The `WQ_MEM_RECLAIM` flag is set to ensure forward progress under memory pressure. This indicates that the patch addresses a potential issue related to memory management.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs and a reviewed-by tag, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

4. The code change itself is straightforward and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The cleanup_perf_probe_events() function is responsible for freeing resources related to a perf probe event. However, it was only freeing resources in trace probe events and not perf probe events. This patch aims to fix this by calling clear_perf_probe_event() as well.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior. It only adds informational print statements.

7. The patch does not appear to have any potential negative impact on the stability or performance of the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, I believe that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch removes the call to `free_irq` in the `wl1251_spi_remove` function. The reason for this change is that the IRQ is allocated using `devm_request_irq`. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Is the removal of `free_irq` justified? If the IRQ is indeed allocated using `devm_request_irq`, then it is not necessary to explicitly free it with `free_irq`. This change aligns with the use of managed resources in the kernel, which automatically handles resource cleanup.

2. Does the patch introduce any new issues or regressions? Removing `free_irq` should not introduce any new issues as long as the IRQ is correctly allocated and released using `devm_request_irq`.

3. Is the patch specific to a particular hardware or driver? The patch is specific to the `wl1251` driver in the `drivers/net/wireless/ti/wl1251/spi.c` file. If this driver is widely used and the change is beneficial, it may be suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

Based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis, including testing and consideration of any potential side effects, is necessary before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with wrong checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The problem lies in comparing the obtained value directly with the target value, which doesn't work as expected. 

The patch introduces a fix by properly shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value. It retrieves the power state using the AC_VERB_GET_POWER_STATE verb, shifts the obtained value by 4 bits to the right, and applies a bitmask to extract the relevant bits. Then, it compares the modified state value with the target value.

This fix ensures that the power state bits are checked correctly, resolving the issue with wrong checks. The patch also applies the same fix to the update_conv_power_state function.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary fix for the incorrect power state checks in the hda/via driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds variable resolution support to the gspca driver by allowing subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions. This enhancement can improve the flexibility and compatibility of the driver.

2. The patch modifies the try_fmt_vid_cap function to pass the original resolution to the subdriver's try_fmt function. This allows the subdriver to modify the format parameters if needed.

3. The vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function is modified to handle the case when the subdriver has a try_fmt function. If the subdriver has a try_fmt function, it sets the gspca_dev->pixfmt to the modified format parameters. Otherwise, it sets gspca_dev->pixfmt to the default format based on the selected mode.

4. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function is modified to call the subdriver's enum_framesizes function if it exists. This allows the subdriver to provide custom frame size enumeration.

5. The gspca.h header file is modified to include new function pointers (cam_format_op and cam_frmsize_op) in the sd_desc structure. These function pointers are used by the subdrivers to implement the try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions.

Overall, the patch adds important functionality to the gspca driver and maintains backward compatibility. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the use of __dev* attributes in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are being removed because the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option is going away.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of __dev* attributes is necessary due to the removal of CONFIG_HOTPLUG, and it does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a local variable called "scanned_queue" to the function "rtw_createbss_cmd23a_callback" in the file "rtw_cmd.c" of the rtl8723au driver.
2. The local variable is assigned the address of the "scanned_queue" member of the "mlmepriv" structure.
3. The patch replaces multiple references to "pmlmepriv->scanned_queue" with the new local variable "scanned_queue" to simplify the code and improve readability.
4. The change also addresses a checkpatch.pl warning about a line exceeding 80 characters by splitting the assignment onto a new line.
5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors.

Overall, the patch seems to improve code readability and maintainability by introducing a local variable and simplifying references to the "scanned_queue" member. It also addresses a coding style warning. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

1. The patch renames the `enum dio200_layout` to `enum dio200_layout_idx`. This change is a simple renaming and does not introduce any functional changes.

2. The comment in the patch states that the `enum dio200_layout` is only used once and renaming it frees up the `dio200_layout` tag for future use. This suggests that the renaming is done to improve code organization and potentially allow for future enhancements.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ian Abbott and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change is limited to the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c` file, which is part of the staging directory. The staging directory is used for drivers that are not yet considered stable but are being actively developed and tested. Therefore, the patch is not introducing changes to stable code.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. This database helps in identifying the vendor string for USB devices.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix and improvement for the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements a rate_update hook in the rs (rate scaling) module of the iwlwifi driver. It re-initializes the rate scaling when a rate_update hook is called, which occurs when a remote STA changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

The patch includes changes in the mac80211.c, rs.c, and rs.h files of the iwlwifi driver. It adds a new parameter "init" to the rs_initialize_lq and iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init functions, and introduces a new function rs_rate_update. The rs_rate_update function is called when a rate_update hook is triggered and performs necessary actions to stop ongoing aggregations and re-initialize the rate scaling.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific issue related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver and improves its functionality.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to be a straightforward code improvement. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma" in the "vb2_vmalloc_put_userptr" function. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by Marek Szyprowski and signed-off by multiple developers.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality from the hdmi_pll_reset() function. The comment in the patch states that the SYSRESET bits in the HDMI PLL do not actually reset the PLL itself but only affect the power used for the PLL. Since there is no reason to use the SYSRESET bits and they are not used in other PLLs, the patch suggests removing the HDMI PLL reset to simplify the code and make it similar to other PLLs.

Removing the HDMI PLL reset does not seem to have any negative impact on the functionality of the code. The hdmi_pll_enable() function, which calls hdmi_pll_reset() before hdmi_pll_config(), no longer calls hdmi_pll_reset() after applying the patch. However, the hdmi_pll_config() function is still called, ensuring that the PLL is configured properly.

Overall, the patch seems to improve the code by removing unnecessary functionality and making it more consistent with other PLLs. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `reconnect_one()` function in `fs/exportfs/expfs.c`. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a filesystem operation.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. The `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function is similar to `lookup_one_len()`, but it performs the lookup without acquiring the inode lock on the parent directory. This change is made to address a specific scenario where the lookup yields a different dentry than the one being reconnected.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is explained in the comment block:

```
/*
 * Somebody has renamed it since exportfs_get_name();
 * great, since it could've only been renamed if it
 * got looked up and thus connected, and it would
 * remain connected afterwards.  We are done.
 */
```

This logic handles the case where the `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function returns a dentry that is different from the one being reconnected (`tmp != dentry`). In this scenario, it implies that the dentry has been renamed since the `exportfs_get_name()` operation. The comment explains that if the dentry has been renamed, it must have been looked up and connected, and it will remain connected afterwards. Therefore, the function can simply skip the reconnection process and proceed to the `out_reconnected` label.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the `reconnect_one()` function, addressing a specific scenario and providing a more efficient way to perform the lookup. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for ARM architecture related to the vm_struct and ioremap mappings. The patch ensures that the phys_addr member of the vm_struct structure is filled in, allowing /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Considering the Acked-by tag from Nicolas Pitre and the Signed-off-by tag from Russell King, both respected contributors in the Linux kernel community, it indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by them.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces NULL values returned by `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it provides more specific error information.

2. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` when too many instances of the audio service are initialized. This is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in handling the error gracefully.

3. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)` when `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory. Again, this is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in proper error handling.

4. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EPERM)` when VCHI connections fail to open. This is another valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in handling the error appropriately.

5. The patch replaces a NULL check where `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is called with `IS_ERR(...)`. This change ensures that the error pointer returned by `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is properly checked.

Overall, the patch improves error handling and provides more specific error information. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. 

The removal of unused code is generally considered a good practice as it reduces code complexity and improves maintainability. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch suggests using an enum for DRM_MINOR_* constants instead of hard-coding the IDs. This change improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The addition of DRM_MINOR_CNT allows for range-checks in follow-up code, which can help prevent potential issues.

3. The IDs of the minor-types are changed by -1, but since they are not used as indices, this change does not introduce any problems.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable and beneficial change to the codebase, and it does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `ur_set_online` function in the `vmur.c` file of the `s390` driver. The purpose of the patch is to link the parent CCW device during the creation of the virtual unit record (UR) device.

The specific change made by the patch is in the `device_create` function call. Previously, the parent device was set to `NULL`, but with the patch, it is set to `&cdev->dev`, which is the parent CCW device.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change seems to be a logical improvement as it ensures that the parent CCW device is properly linked during UR device creation.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes redundant code in the bnx2x_init_dev() function.
2. The redundant code sets the device power state to D0, which is already done by the Pci_enable_device() function.
3. The patch also removes redundant code for finding the power management capability of the PCI device, as the pci core has already saved this value.
4. The patch includes appropriate Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch improves code efficiency by removing redundant operations and does not introduce any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command. This option allows explicitly enabling the CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. This addition enhances the functionality of the "perf record" tool.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "builtin-record.c" file to handle the new option. It adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the list of available options and sets the "record.opts.sample_cpu" flag accordingly.

3. The "perf.h" file is modified to include the "sample_cpu" flag in the "record_opts" structure.

4. The "evsel.c" file is updated to check if the "sample_cpu" flag is set or if the target has a CPU. If either condition is true, the CPU sample bit is set for the event selector.

Overall, the patch introduces a new option to explicitly enable CPU sample type in the "perf record" command. It appears to be well-implemented and does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the `dm_thin_find_block()` function in the `dm-thin-metadata.c` file. The issue is that the `->fail_io` flag is checked outside the `metadata` device's `root_lock`, which can lead to a race condition with the setting of this flag.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for `pmd->fail_io` inside the `root_lock` section. If `pmd->fail_io` is true, the function returns `-EINVAL` and releases the `root_lock` before doing so.

This change ensures that the `->fail_io` flag is properly synchronized with the `root_lock`, preventing any race conditions.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the race condition and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning related to NOHZ local_softirq_pending. This indicates that the patch addresses a known issue and aims to resolve it.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `netif_rx()` with `netif_rx_ni()`. The `netif_rx_ni()` function is specifically designed to be used from process/softirq context, which suggests that this change is necessary to ensure proper context handling.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The change is localized to the `dp83640.c` file within the `drivers/net/phy` directory, which suggests that it is specific to the DP83640 PHY driver.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid fix for a known issue and does not introduce any significant risks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple addition of MODULE_ALIAS for the "aat2870-regulator" platform. This alias allows the module to be loaded using the platform name instead of the module name.

Since this patch is a minor addition and does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing code, it can be considered a safe and non-disruptive change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds debug error messages to report command timeout in the `lio_process_ordered_list()` function. This can be helpful for troubleshooting and identifying any issues related to command timeouts.

2. The patch also adds the host failure status in an existing error message in the `if_cfg_callback()` function. This provides additional information about the failure status, which can aid in diagnosing and resolving any configuration-related issues.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The changes are specific to the `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/lio_main.c` and `drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/liquidio/response_manager.c` files, which suggests that they are targeted and relevant to the specific driver in question.

Overall, the patch appears to improve error reporting and enhance the debugging capabilities of the `liquidio` driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

By removing this redundant code, the patch simplifies the codebase and improves maintainability.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors and relevant individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Therefore, considering the reasons mentioned above, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to tidy up the ni_stc.h header file in the staging/comedi directory.
2. It renames the CamelCase and converts enums into defines, which improves code readability and maintainability.
3. The patch uses the BIT() macro to define the bits, which is a common practice in the Linux kernel.
4. The patch modifies the ni_cdio_cmdtest() function by replacing the CR_PACK_FLAGS() macro with NI_M_CDO_MODE_SAMPLE_SRC_MASK, improving clarity and consistency.
5. The ni_cdo_inttrig() function remains unchanged.
6. The ni_cdio_cmd() function is modified to use the NI_M_CDO_MODE_* defines instead of the CDO_* enum values. This change improves code readability and maintainability.
7. The ni_cdio_cmd() function now sets the cdo_mode_bits variable using the NI_M_CDO_MODE_* defines, which makes the code more explicit and easier to understand.
8. The ni_cdio_cmd() function also sets the cdo_mode_bits variable based on the cmd->scan_begin_arg value, which is a valid operation.
9. The ni_cdio_cmd() function sets the cdo_mode_bits variable based on the cmd->scan_begin_arg & CR_INVERT condition, which is also a valid operation.
10. The ni_cdio_cmd() function writes the cdo_mode_bits value to the NI_M_CDO_MODE_REG register, which is the intended behavior.
11. The ni_cdio_cmd() function writes the s->state value to the NI_M_CDO_FIFO_DATA_REG register, which is the intended behavior.
12. The ni_stc.h header file is modified to define the NI_M_CDO_MODE_* bits and masks, which is consistent with other definitions in the file.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch modifies the `whitelist` array in the `intel_uncore.c` file of the i915 driver.

2. The change is made to the `gen_bitmask` field of the `whitelist` array entry that corresponds to the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` register.

3. The original `gen_bitmask` value was `GEN_RANGE(4, 8)`, which means it allowed the register to be accessed for generations 4 to 8 (inclusive).

4. The patch changes the `gen_bitmask` value to `GEN_RANGE(4, 9)`, which means it allows the register to be accessed for generations 4 to 9 (inclusive).

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is extending the range of generations for which the `RING_TIMESTAMP(RENDER_RING_BASE)` register can be accessed. This change appears to be a valid and safe modification.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `nouveau_abi16` which is a locked variant of `nouveau_abi16_get`. This new function will be used by USIF to access ABI16 data for limited interoperability.

2. The existing `nouveau_abi16_get` function is modified to call the new `nouveau_abi16` function and return the `cli->abi16` value if it exists.

3. The `nouveau_abi16_get` function acquires the client mutex lock before calling `nouveau_abi16` and returns the `cli->abi16` value if it exists. If `cli->abi16` does not exist, the mutex lock is released before returning NULL.

4. The `nouveau_abi16_put` function is not modified in this patch.

Overall, this patch introduces a locked variant of `nouveau_abi16_get` and ensures proper locking and unlocking of the client mutex. It appears to be a valid and necessary modification to improve the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch removes the ceph_osdc_build_request() function call from the start_read() function in fs/ceph/addr.c and adds it after allocating the request structure. Similarly, in fs/ceph/file.c, the ceph_osdc_build_request() function call is removed from the ceph_sync_write() function and added after setting the alignment and inode. In net/ceph/osd_client.c, the ceph_osdc_build_request() function call is removed from the ceph_osdc_readpages() and ceph_osdc_writepages() functions and added after setting the extent and alignment.

The patch also adds a comment in fs/ceph/file.c to indicate a potential bug, but it is commented out.

Overall, the patch seems to improve the code by deferring the building of the osd request until necessary, which can potentially enhance performance and reduce unnecessary overhead. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for Gemini Lake processors to the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. Here is my analysis:

1. The patch adds support for the Gemini Lake processor by including it in the list of supported CPUs in the intel_pstate_cpu_ids array.
2. The patch uses the same parameters as the INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_GOLDMONT processor, indicating that the Gemini Lake processor shares similar characteristics and can be handled in a similar manner.
3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Intel, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for a new processor and follows the existing pattern for handling similar processors in the intel_pstate driver.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new advertising setting called "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" to the Bluetooth subsystem. This setting allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting.

2. The patch modifies the "enable_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" to handle the new advertising setting. If the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set, the controller is switched to connectable mode. Otherwise, the existing "get_connectable" function is used to determine the connectable mode.

3. The "set_advertising" function in "net/bluetooth/mgmt.c" is also modified to handle the new advertising setting. If the "cp->val" (value) is 0x02, the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set. If it is 0x00 or 0x01, the flag is cleared. This ensures that the advertising mode is correctly set based on the provided value.

4. The patch includes proper error handling and response sending to user space.

Overall, the patch adds a useful feature to the Bluetooth subsystem by allowing independent control of the connectable mode during advertising.

2. The change in `frequency_min` from 110000000 to 55000000 ensures that the minimum frequency range is adjusted to cover the complete ATSC/QAM-B range. This change aligns with the purpose of the patch and ensures compatibility with the desired frequency range.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable and beneficial modification to the Si2157 tuner driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the '0x' notation from the format specifier '%pad' used in the dev_dbg() statements. The '%pad' format specifier automatically prints the value in hexadecimal format, including the '0x' prefix. However, in this case, the '0x' prefix is unnecessary and can result in a '0x0x' string.

By removing the '0x' prefix, the patch ensures that the dev_dbg() statements correctly print the value without any redundant '0x' prefix.

The patch has been signed-off by Fabio Estevam and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes. Additionally, it has been Acked-by Paul Zimmerman, further confirming its acceptance.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to use the comedi_fc helper `cfc_check_trigger_arg_is()` to validate the trigger arguments when the source is TRIG_TIMER.

2. The local variable `tmp` is changed to an unsigned int and renamed to `arg` for aesthetic reasons.

3. The patch checks if the triggers are trivially valid.

4. If `cmd->scan_begin_src` is TRIG_TIMER, the patch performs the following steps:
   a. Rounds `cmd->scan_begin_arg` to the nearest microsecond.
   b. Updates `cmd->scan_begin_arg` with the rounded value.
   c. Calls `cfc_check_trigger_arg_is()` to validate the argument.
   d. Sets the `err` flag if there is an error.

5. If `cmd->convert_src` is TRIG_TIMER, the patch performs similar steps as in step 4.

6. Finally, the patch checks if there were any errors during the argument validation and returns the result.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It introduces improvements by using the comedi_fc helper to validate trigger arguments and ensures that the arguments are correctly rounded to the nearest microsecond.

3. The patch modifies the __sched_setscheduler() function to use the attr::sched_flags field instead of the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag.
4. The patch also adds a new SCHED_FLAG_RESET_ON_FORK flag to be used with the sched_{set,get}attr() calls.
5. The _sched_setscheduler() function is introduced to handle the legacy SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK hack and set the attr::sched_flags field accordingly.
6. The sched_setscheduler() and sched_setscheduler_nocheck() functions are modified to use the _sched_setscheduler() function.
7. The sched_getattr() function is modified to set the attr::sched_flags field if the task has the sched_reset_on_fork flag set.

Overall, the patch improves the handling of the SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK flag and introduces a new attr::sched_flags field to handle flags in a more organized manner. It also ensures backward compatibility with the legacy SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK hack. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fix it provides, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the pr_debug() statement is never executed. The patch suggests removing the pr_debug() statement, which is considered unreachable code. 

In general, it is good practice to remove unreachable code as it can lead to confusion and unnecessary overhead. However, it is important to ensure that the removal of the code does not introduce any unintended side effects or break any existing functionality.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it removes unreachable code, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

1. The patch adds a new line of code `pDevice->byPacketType = CARDbyGetPktType(pDevice);` at line 342. This sets the `byPacketType` variable in the `pDevice` structure by calling the `CARDbyGetPktType` function. This change seems to fix an issue where `byPacketType` was not being set at all. This change appears to be a bug fix.

2. The patch modifies the condition in the `CARDbIsOFDMinBasicRate` function at line 876. It changes `(pDevice->wBasicRate)` to `(pDevice->basic_rates)` in the condition. This change seems to fix an issue where the `wBasicRate` variable was not being checked correctly. This change also appears to be a bug fix.

Based on the analysis, it seems that this patch addresses two issues and provides bug fixes. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new helper function called `sk_stream_is_writeable()` in `include/net/sock.h`. This helper function simplifies the condition used in several call sites that check if the socket's write space is sufficient.

2. The motivation for introducing this helper function is to accommodate the future support for TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT, which will change the condition for TCP sockets.

3. The patch is signed-off by Eric Dumazet and David S. Miller, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch also includes Acked-by from Neal Cardwell, indicating that he has reviewed and approved the changes.

5. The patch modifies multiple files (`net/ceph/messenger.c`, `net/core/stream.c`, `net/dccp/proto.c`, `net/ipv4/tcp.c`, `net/sunrpc/svcsock.c`, `net/sunrpc/xprtsock.c`) to use the new helper function instead of the hardcoded condition.

6. The changes in these files ensure that the `sk_stream_is_writeable()` helper function is used consistently across different network protocols.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and beneficial improvement. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `__put_ioctx` function in the `fs/aio.c` file. The changes involve replacing the calls to `cancel_delayed_work` and `cancel_work_sync` with a single call to `cancel_delayed_work_sync` on the `ctx->wq` delayed work queue.

The purpose of this change is to ensure that any delayed work scheduled on the `ctx->wq` work queue is canceled synchronously before freeing the resources associated with the `kioctx` structure.

By using `cancel_delayed_work_sync`, the patch ensures that any pending delayed work is canceled and waits for the work to complete before proceeding. This helps prevent any potential race conditions or resource leaks that could occur if the work is not canceled properly.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary improvement to the code. It addresses a potential issue and improves the reliability and stability of the AIO (Asynchronous I/O) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix and enhancement for the DRM driver of the Intel i915 graphics card. The patch adds support for CRC interrupts for pre-gen5/vlv and includes a small refactoring for gen2.

2. The issue was reported by Paulo Zanoni and reviewed by the same person, indicating that it has been thoroughly examined by an experienced developer.

3. The patch adds a check to filter out frontbuffer tracking flushes when no bits are set. If no bits are set, the function returns early, avoiding unnecessary processing.

4. The patch also includes a call to `intel_mark_fb_busy()` and `intel_edp_drrs_flush()`, which are relevant functions for handling frontbuffer tracking.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue and provides a clean solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to prevent recursion in the get_user_pages() function within the drm/amdgpu driver. It introduces a new structure called "amdgpu_ttm_gup_task_list" to keep track of tasks inside get_user_pages() and ignores MMU callbacks from there.

The patch modifies the "struct amdgpu_ttm_tt" by adding the "guptasklock" spinlock and "guptasks" list_head to handle the new structure. It initializes these new additions in the amdgpu_ttm_tt_set_userptr() function.

In the amdgpu_ttm_tt_pin_userptr() function, the patch adds code to create a new "guptask" and adds it to the "guptasks" list before calling get_user_pages(). After the get_user_pages() call, it removes the "guptask" from the list. This ensures that the current task is not affected by the MMU callbacks.

In the amdgpu_ttm_tt_affect_userptr() function, the patch adds code to iterate over the "guptasks" list and checks if the current task is already present. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the userptr is not affected by the current task.

Overall, the patch introduces necessary changes to prevent recursion and handle MMU callbacks properly. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a warning reported by the static analysis tool Smatch. The warning indicates a duplicate "const" declaration in the file "drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-imx.c" at line 435.

2. The patch removes the duplicated "const" keyword from the declaration of the variable "list" at line 435.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

4. The change is a simple fix that removes the duplicate "const" keyword, which is not necessary and can cause confusion or potential issues.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported warning and does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to make the VLAN deletion function symmetric with the VLAN addition function in the mlxsw spectrum driver. Previously, the __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() function was removed from the driver's init sequence, causing it to be non-symmetric.

The patch reintroduces the __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_del() function and places it after the necessary operations. It first checks if the port is bridged, and if not, returns an error. Then, it sets the port's PVID (Port VLAN ID) to 0 if it falls within the range of the VLANs being deleted. After that, it removes the VLANs from the port using the __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_set() function. Finally, it performs additional operations related to the VLAN deletion.

The patch ensures that the VLAN deletion function is symmetric with the VLAN addition function, which improves the overall consistency and maintainability of the mlxsw spectrum driver.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

The patch modifies the `dw_mipi_dsi_dcs_short_write` function in the `dw-mipi-dsi.c` file of the Rockchip DRM driver. The purpose of the patch is to avoid an out-of-bounds read on `tx_buf` and to explicitly encode the endianness instead of casting a `u16`.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:
- The `tx_buf` variable is changed from `const u16*` to `const u8*`.
- A new variable `data` of type `u16` is introduced and initialized to 0.
- The `val` variable is now assigned the value of `GEN_HDATA(data) | GEN_HTYPE(msg->type)`.
- The `tx_buf` array is accessed to populate the `data` variable based on the `msg->tx_len` value.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses an issue related to out-of-bounds read on `tx_buf` and improves the endianness encoding. These changes appear to be valid and necessary for the stability and correctness of the Rockchip DRM driver.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to ensure that all DAPM widget IO operations hold the component mutex (codec or platform). This is achieved by introducing two new inline functions, `soc_widget_lock` and `soc_widget_unlock`, and modifying the existing function `soc_widget_update_bits` to use these new functions.

The patch also modifies several places where `soc_widget_update_bits` is called to use the new function `soc_widget_update_bits_locked` instead.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it addresses a potential issue by ensuring proper locking, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for a NULL platform data pointer, which is important for preventing issues when a driver incorrectly sets up a probe request without defining the platform_data structure. This check ensures that the driver does not proceed with uninitialized or invalid data.

2. The patch also includes an error message ("NULL platform data") to provide clear feedback in case the check fails. This helps with debugging and identifying the root cause of the issue.

3. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior significantly. It only adds a necessary check for NULL platform data, which is a defensive programming practice.

Considering these factors, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames `pfScanResult` of `struct scan_attr` to `result` to avoid using CamelCase naming convention. This change improves code readability and consistency.

2. In the `Handle_Scan` function, the patch updates the assignment of `pfUserScanResult` from `pstrHostIFscanAttr->pfScanResult` to `pstrHostIFscanAttr->result`. This change aligns with the renamed variable in `struct scan_attr`.

3. Similarly, in the `host_int_scan` function, the patch updates the assignment of `pfScanResult` from `ScanResult` to `msg.body.scan_info.result`. Again, this aligns with the renamed variable in `struct scan_attr`.

Overall, the patch is a simple and straightforward change that improves code style and consistency without introducing any functional changes or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `rpcrdma_receive_wc` to `rpcrdma_wc_receive`. This change aligns with the naming convention used elsewhere in the codebase, which is `{svc_rdma,rpcrdma}_wc_{operation}`. This improves code consistency and maintainability.

2. The function `rpcrdma_wc_receive` is invoked by the RDMA provider for each polled Receive WC (Work Completion). The function takes a completion queue (`cq`) and a completed WR (Work Request) as parameters.

3. The patch updates the assignment of the `done` field in the `rr_cqe` structure of the `rpcrdma_rep` object. It changes the assignment from `rpcrdma_receive_wc` to `rpcrdma_wc_receive`. This ensures that the correct function is invoked when a Receive WC is completed.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves code consistency and naming conventions.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch switches the usage of `dcache_readdir` to `iterate_shared` in multiple file operations structures (`spufs_context_fops`, `autofs4_root_operations`, `autofs4_dir_operations`, and `simple_dir_operations`). This change ensures that the directory is not locked during the iteration, improving performance.

2. The patch removes the unnecessary locking of the directory in `dcache_dir_lseek()`. Since per-struct file exclusion is already in place, there is no need for additional locking. This change simplifies the code and reduces unnecessary locking overhead.

3. The patch removes the `inode_lock` and `inode_unlock` calls in `dcache_dir_lseek()`. As the directory locking is no longer required, these calls become unnecessary.

Overall, the patch improves performance and simplifies the code without introducing any apparent issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch moves some deallocations to the `dev_release()` function, which is a step towards using the class device lifetime management features more effectively. This improves code maintainability and reduces redundancy.

2. The `regulator_dev_release()` function is modified to deallocate the `rdev->constraints` and release the reference to `rdev->dev.of_node`. This ensures proper cleanup of resources when a regulator device is released.

3. The `regulator_unregister()` function is modified to remove the deallocation of `rdev->constraints` and the release of `rdev->dev.of_node`. These deallocations are now handled in the `regulator_dev_release()` function, which is called during device release.

Overall, the patch improves code organization and ensures proper resource deallocation. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid patch for the Linux kernel. The patch adds the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro to the of_palmas_match_tbl array in the palmas.c file under the drivers/mfd directory. This macro is used to generate the necessary data structures for device probing and matching based on the Open Firmware device tree.

Including the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro is generally recommended for device drivers that use the of_device_id table for device matching. It allows the kernel to automatically load the driver module when a matching device is found in the device tree.

3. The patch introduces a local variable `size` to store the calculated size, which helps shorten some lines and improve code readability.

4. The patch checks for potential overflow before allocating memory for `header->snapc`. It ensures that the multiplication of `snap_count` and `sizeof(header->snapc->snaps[0])` does not exceed the maximum size allowed by `SIZE_MAX`.

5. The patch also checks for potential overflow before allocating memory for `header->snap_sizes`. It calculates the size based on `snap_count` and `sizeof(*header->snap_sizes)`.

6. The patch replaces the usage of `sizeof(ondisk->block_name)` with `sizeof(ondisk->block_name) + 1` when allocating memory for `header->object_prefix`. This ensures that there is enough space to store the null-terminated string.

7. The patch copies the content of `ondisk->block_name` to `header->object_prefix` using the calculated size minus one to avoid copying the null terminator twice.

8. The patch does not introduce any new issues or regressions.

2. The patch includes a clear error message indicating the lack of credits to receive LE L2CAP data.

3. The patch calls the "l2cap_send_disconn_req" function to send an appropriate L2CAP Disconnect request when there are no credits available. This ensures that the channel is properly disconnected in such situations.

4. The patch returns -ENOBUFS to indicate the lack of available buffers when there are no credits, which is an appropriate error code for this scenario.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a proper solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a section mismatch warning in the pmagb-b-fb driver. The warning occurs due to a missed update from a previous commit. The patch removes the incorrect `__init` annotation from the `pmagbbfb_erase_cursor` function, resolving the section mismatch issue.

Since the patch fixes a warning and ensures proper function annotations, it is considered a valid fix for the issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the dummy implementation of the `load_lut()` callback function is being removed from the `mdp4_crtc_helper_funcs` and `mdp5_crtc_helper_funcs` structures in the `mdp4_crtc.c` and `mdp5_crtc.c` files respectively.

The patch states that the `load_lut()` callback is optional, and therefore a dummy implementation is not needed. This suggests that the function is not required for the proper functioning of the code.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it removes unnecessary code and aligns with the intention of making the `load_lut()` callback optional.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not take into account any potential dependencies or conflicts with other parts of the codebase. A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire codebase is recommended before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch removes an unnecessary check before calling the `platform_device_put()` function. The `platform_device_put()` function already checks if its argument is NULL and returns immediately, so the additional check is redundant. Removing this unnecessary check improves code readability and reduces code complexity.

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by two contributors, Markus Elfring and Tomi Valkeinen, which indicates that it has undergone some level of review and testing.

Therefore, considering the removal of redundant code and the sign-off by contributors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Additionally, the patch has been Acked-by Uwe Kleine-König and Signed-off-by Marc Kleine-Budde, indicating that it has already received positive reviews from other developers.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the intention is to replace the usage of `unlock_page` and `page_cache_release` with `f2fs_put_page` for a more uniform coding style in the f2fs code.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) and including it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `nfs_direct_write_reschedule` and `nfs_direct_write_schedule_iovec` functions in the `fs/nfs/direct.c` file.

In both functions, the patch replaces the call to `nfs_pageio_init_write` with a call to `NFS_PROTO(dreq->inode)->write_pageio_init`. This change reintroduces the capability for direct IO to use pnfs.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a regression with pnfs and ensures that direct IO can use pnfs as intended.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential side effects or conflicts with other patches. A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire Linux kernel codebase would be necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros from the code. The comment states that these macros are "silly use-once macros that simply obfuscates the code." Removing these macros simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.

The patch also modifies the DBG_8723A macro in the rtw_cfg80211_add_monitor_if function. Previously, it used the NDEV_FMT and NDEV_ARG macros to print the name of the monitor interface. With the patch, it directly uses pwdev_priv->pmon_ndev->name to print the name. This change improves code readability and removes unnecessary macro usage.

Overall, the patch improves code clarity and removes unnecessary macros. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, but it simplifies the codebase. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch aims to improve the performance of the memslot lookup operation in the KVM subsystem by adding a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism.
   - It states that in typical guest boot workloads, only 2-3 memslots are extensively used, and the same memslot lookup operation is performed repeatedly.

2. Changes introduced by the patch:
   - A new field `lru_slot` of type `atomic_t` is added to the `struct kvm_memslots` to store the index of the most recently used memslot.
   - The `search_memslots` function is modified to utilize the LRU cache:
     - It first checks if the requested `gfn` falls within the range of the memslot stored in the `lru_slot`. If so, it returns the memslot directly.
     - If not, it iterates over all memslots to find the appropriate one and updates the `lru_slot` with the index of the found memslot.

3. Benefits of the patch:
   - The patch claims to improve the average lookup time for the given workload from 46 to 28 cycles, which is approximately a 40% improvement.
   - By caching the most recently used memslot, the patch reduces the need for iterating over all memslots in most cases, resulting in faster lookup operations.

2. The `its_read_baser` function takes an `its_node` structure and a `struct its_baser` pointer as arguments. It calculates the index of the `baser` within the `its->tables` array and reads the corresponding value from the ITS BASERn register using `readq_relaxed`.

3. The `its_write_baser` function takes the same arguments as `its_read_baser` along with a `u64` value to be written. It calculates the index of the `baser` within the `its->tables` array and writes the value to the ITS BASERn register using `writeq_relaxed`. It also updates the `baser->val` field by calling `its_read_baser` after the write operation.

4. The patch modifies the `its_alloc_tables` function to use the new helper functions. Instead of directly accessing the ITS BASERn register, it now uses `its_read_baser` to read the value and `its_write_baser_cache` to write the value. This improves code readability and maintainability.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of existing code. It only adds helper functions and updates the usage in the `its_alloc_tables` function.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the condition `path > 0 || tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is being removed and replaced with `path > 0`. The patch also includes a reported-by tag and is signed-off by multiple contributors.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the changes made and their impact on the codebase.

In the original code, the condition `path > 0 || tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is used to check if either `path` is greater than 0 or `tid` is greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID`. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false and sets the `csmi_status` accordingly.

The patch removes the `tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID` part of the condition, making it `path > 0`. This change implies that the check for `tid` being greater than `ESAS2R_MAX_ID` is no longer necessary or relevant.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is removing a test for an impossible condition (`tid > ESAS2R_MAX_ID`) and simplifying the code by only checking `path > 0`. Since the original condition is unnecessary and the patch does not introduce any new issues, it is reasonable to conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `host1x_bo_lookup()` in the `gr2d.c` file of the `drivers/gpu/host1x/drm` directory. The purpose of the patch is to fix the return value of the function.

In the original code, the function returns 0 when the `drm_gem_object_lookup()` function fails to find a gem object. However, returning 0 implies success, which is incorrect in this case. The patch changes the return value from 0 to NULL, which accurately represents the failure to find a gem object.

This change ensures that the caller of `host1x_bo_lookup()` can correctly handle the failure case. By returning NULL, it allows the caller to identify the failure and take appropriate action.

Therefore, considering the correctness and improvement in error handling, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward replacement of the deprecated `hid_output_raw_report` function with the recommended `hid_hw_output_report` function. This change is suggested for the Wiimote driver in the HID subsystem.

Considering that the patch is a simple API replacement and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions, it can be considered safe for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to set the clock divider in the probe function instead of setting it for each transfer in the meson_i2c driver. This change is beneficial because the bus frequency is fixed to what is set in the device tree (DT), so there is no need to set the clock divider for each transfer.

The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" and the related code that sets the clock divider based on this frequency. Instead, the frequency value is obtained from the device tree using the "clock-frequency" property. If the property is not found, a default frequency is used.

The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is modified to accept the frequency as an argument and set the clock divider accordingly.

In the "meson_i2c_probe" function, the clock frequency is obtained from the device tree, and then the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is called to set the clock divider based on this frequency.

Overall, this patch simplifies the code by setting the clock divider in the probe function and removes the need to set it for each transfer. It also improves maintainability by obtaining the frequency value from the device tree.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the omapdrm driver's framebuffer creation error messages. Instead of printing the error messages as error-level logs, it changes them to debug-level logs. This change is made to prevent userspace from flooding the kernel log with validation failures of userspace parameters.

The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues. It only modifies the log level of error messages. This change is not expected to have any negative impact on the stability or functionality of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose and impact, it seems reasonable to accept it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Additionally, the patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Markus Elfring and Takashi Iwai, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Therefore, considering the removal of unnecessary code and the sign-off by the contributors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the declaration of the variable `ErrXDCode` is being moved from the header file `smil.h` to the file `smilsub.c`. This change is made because `ErrXDCode` is only used in `smilsub.c`, so there is no need for an external declaration in the header file and an unnecessary declaration in `smilmain.c`.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change improves code organization by keeping the declaration of `ErrXDCode` within the file where it is used, reducing unnecessary declarations in other files. Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant contributors, which adds credibility to its acceptance.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and its impact on the system would be necessary for a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is titled "KVM: VMX: Improve error reporting during invalid guest state emulation." It aims to enhance error reporting to userspace when instruction emulation fails.

In the code changes, the patch adds error reporting logic when the `err` variable is not equal to `EMULATE_DONE`. It sets the `exit_reason` field of the `vcpu->run` structure to `KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR` and the `suberror` field to `KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION`. Additionally, it sets the `ndata` field to 0. This ensures that the error is properly reported to userspace.

The patch also includes a check for pending signals before returning from the function, which is unrelated to the error reporting improvement.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to error reporting during invalid guest state emulation in the KVM VMX subsystem. It provides a clear and concise solution without introducing any potential regressions or side effects. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `rawv6_send_hdrinc()` in the `net/ipv6/raw.c` file. The change involves switching from passing `msg->iov_iter.iov` to passing `msg` itself as an argument.

The patch updates the function call `rawv6_send_hdrinc(sk, (struct iovec *)msg->msg_iter.iov, len, &fl6, &dst, msg->msg_flags)` to `rawv6_send_hdrinc(sk, msg, len, &fl6, &dst, msg->msg_flags)`.

The change is beneficial because it simplifies the function signature and eliminates the need for type casting. Instead of passing the `iov_iter.iov` member of the `msg` structure, the entire `msg` structure is passed directly.

This change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only improves code readability and maintainability by using the `msg` structure directly.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the failure logging into the `isl29028_set_als_scale()` function. Previously, the failure logging was done by the callers of this function. Moving the logging reduces code duplication and improves code maintainability.

2. The patch adds a `dev` variable to get the device associated with the `regmap` in `isl29028_set_als_scale()`. This variable is then used to log the failure message if `regmap_update_bits()` fails.

3. The `ret` variable is declared and used to store the return value of `regmap_update_bits()`. If the function fails, the error message is logged using `dev_err()` and the error code is returned.

4. After setting the ALS scale, the `lux_scale` member of the `chip` structure is updated.

5. In the `isl29028_write_raw()` function, the call to `isl29028_set_als_scale()` is modified to remove the duplicate error logging. The error logging is now handled within `isl29028_set_als_scale()` itself.

6. In the `isl29028_chip_init_and_power_on()` function, the call to `isl29028_set_als_scale()` is modified to remove the duplicate error logging. The error logging is now handled within `isl29028_set_als_scale()` itself.

Overall, the patch improves code maintainability by reducing code duplication and centralizing the failure logging. It also ensures that the failure message is consistently logged when `regmap_update_bits()` fails. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple typo fix in the zd_usb.c and zd_mac.c files of the zd1211rw driver. The patch corrects the spelling of "reseting" to "resetting" in two different locations.

false || This patch is a simple renaming of a function in the rtl8192e staging driver. The function `r8192_wx_set_retry` is renamed to `_rtl92e_wx_set_retry` to follow the naming convention used in other rtlwifi devices.

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a straightforward code cleanup and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes. Therefore, it can be considered a safe change and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

My recommendation is to accept this patch (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's my analysis:

The patch introduces a new function called `reset_shadow_stats()`, which is intended to move the shadow counters reset code into a separate function. This is done as a preparation for moving it into its own object.

The patch also modifies the existing function `perf_stat__reset_stats()` to call the newly introduced `reset_shadow_stats()` function after resetting the stats for each event selector in the event list.

The changes made in this patch seem reasonable and follow good coding practices by separating the reset code into its own function. This can improve code readability and maintainability.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs and relevant Cc's to the appropriate individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the relevant parties.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to correct the number of bitrates in the mwifiex driver's supported bitrate array. Previously, two bitrates (22Mbps and 72Mbps) were removed, reducing the number of bitrates from 14 to 12. 

The patch initializes the ".n_bitrates" field to the size of the mwifiex_rates array using the ARRAY_SIZE macro, instead of hardcoding the value to 14. This change ensures that the ".n_bitrates" field is always updated correctly if the mwifiex_rates array size changes in the future.

Overall, this patch improves the accuracy of the supported bitrate array by dynamically setting the number of bitrates based on the array size. It is a straightforward and necessary correction, and it does not introduce any potential issues or regressions.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" (IBS) facility on the s390 architecture. The patch modifies the `struct sclp_info` in `arch/s390/include/asm/sclp.h` to include a new flag `has_ibs`, and updates the `sclp_facilities_detect` function in `drivers/s390/char/sclp_early.c` to set the `has_ibs` flag based on the value of `sccb->fac117 & 0x20`.

Considering that the patch adds support for a new hardware facility, it is likely a functional enhancement rather than a bug fix. Therefore, it should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). Stable releases typically focus on bug fixes and security patches rather than introducing new features or hardware support.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the patch and its impact on the stability and compatibility of the Linux kernel would be necessary for a definitive decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function `bcm47xxnflash_ops_bcm4706_dev_ready` which checks the device readiness status. This function is necessary for proper operation of the bcm47xxnflash driver.

2. The `dev_ready` function is then assigned to the `dev_ready` field of the `nand_chip` structure, indicating that it should be used for checking device readiness.

3. The `chip_delay` field of the `nand_chip` structure is also set to 50, which specifies the delay in microseconds between chip select and command execution. This value is necessary for proper timing in the bcm47xxnflash driver.

4. The patch also sets the `bbt_options` field of the `nand_chip` structure to `NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH`, indicating that the driver should use the flash for bad block management.

5. Finally, the patch sets the ECC mode to `NAND_ECC_NONE`, indicating that the driver does not currently implement ECC functionality.

Overall, the patch adds necessary functionality and configuration options to the bcm47xxnflash driver. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code cleanup change. The patch removes the assignment of the "owner" field in the platform_driver structure, as it is not necessary. The "owner" field is automatically populated by the driver core.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a termios/port flags mismatch in the serial core driver.
2. The patch ensures that the uart port drivers reconfigure termios settings correctly based on available hardware support.
3. The patch calls the port driver's `.set_termios` method after reconfiguring the termios settings, ensuring proper synchronization.
4. The patch reloads the `cflag` from termios after calling `uart_change_speed`, which allows the port driver to override flags if necessary.
5. The patch addresses a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward fix for a termios/port flags mismatch in the serial core driver. It improves the correctness and reliability of the driver, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch moves the `qos_request` field from the `saa7134_fh` structure to the `saa7134_dev` structure in the `saa7134-video.c` file. This change makes `qos_request` a global field instead of a per-filehandle field.

2. In the `saa7134-streamon` function, the patch updates the `pm_qos_add_request` function call to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.

3. In the `saa7134-streamoff` function, the patch updates the `pm_qos_remove_request` function call to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`.

4. In the `saa7134.h` header file, the patch removes the `qos_request` field from the `saa7134_fh` structure.

5. In the `saa7134_dev` structure, the patch adds the `qos_request` field.

Based on the analysis, it seems that the patch is making changes to improve the handling of the `qos_request` field in the `saa7134` driver. The changes appear to be logical and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the scan_read_raw_oob() function in the nand_bbt.c file. It introduces a change to handle the return value of mtd->read_oob() specially when scanning for simple bad block markers.

Previously, any non-zero return value from mtd->read_oob() would be considered an error and returned as is. However, with this patch, ECC errors (-EUCLEAN or -EBADMSG) are ignored when checking for bad block markers. This change is justified because ECC errors are not relevant for identifying true bad blocks in this specific context.

Similarly, the patch also modifies the scan_block_fast() function to ignore ECC errors when checking for bad block markers.

Overall, this patch improves the handling of ECC errors during bad block marker scanning, making the process more efficient and accurate.

Hence, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code change related to the MIPS architecture in the Linux kernel. The patch moves the bus watcher from the deprecated `__initcall` to `device_initcall`. 

In general, patches that involve moving code from deprecated functions to recommended alternatives are considered beneficial for stability and maintainability. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes it introduces:

1. The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` in `vport.c` file. This function is responsible for modifying the minimum inline header mode for a virtual function (VF) in the Mellanox mlx5 driver.

2. The function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` takes the Mellanox device (`mdev`), the virtual port number (`vport`), and the minimum inline value (`min_inline`) as input parameters.

3. Inside the function, it initializes an input buffer `in` with the necessary fields for modifying the minimum inline header mode.

4. The function then calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` with the input buffer and its length to modify the NIC vport context.

5. The patch also adds a declaration for `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` in `vport.h` and updates the declaration for `mlx5_query_nic_vport_min_inline` to include the correct parameter type.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch introduces a new function and updates the necessary declarations to enable setting the minimum inline header mode for virtual functions in the Mellanox mlx5 driver. Since this is a driver-specific enhancement and does not affect the core functionality of the Linux kernel, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a specific issue related to the interaction between freezing the file system and the auto defragmentation feature in Btrfs. 

The patch adds two lines of code to the __btrfs_run_defrag_inode() function in fs/btrfs/file.c. It calls sb_start_write() before initiating the defragmentation process and sb_end_write() after completing it. These functions are used to acquire and release the superblock write lock, respectively.

Considering the purpose of the patch and the changes it introduces, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue where the auto defragmentation process could run even when the file system is frozen, which could lead to unexpected behavior or performance degradation.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch's code and testing in various scenarios is necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch simplifies the ternary operators in the mwifiex_config_scan() function using the GNU extension. This simplification improves code readability and reduces the chances of introducing errors. The patch has also been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone thorough scrutiny.

Therefore, I believe this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to clean up manual bias level transitions in the ASoC adau17x1 CODEC driver. This suggests that the patch improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The patch replaces the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in the suspend function and SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in the resume function with the suspend_bias_off flag. This change makes the code shorter and cleaner.

3. The patch modifies the adau1761_codec_driver and adau1781_codec_driver structures by setting the suspend_bias_off flag to true. This ensures that the CODEC driver's suspend_bias_off flag is set correctly.

4. The patch removes the adau17x1_suspend function, which was previously used to set the bias level to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF during suspend. This function is no longer needed since the suspend_bias_off flag handles the transition automatically.

5. The adau17x1_resume function remains unchanged, except for the removal of the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY. This function is responsible for resuming the CODEC and synchronizing the register cache.

6. The adau17x1_suspend function declaration is removed from the adau17x1.h header file since it is no longer used.

Overall, the patch improves code cleanliness and removes unnecessary manual bias level transitions. It also simplifies the suspend and resume functions by utilizing the suspend_bias_off flag. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes are adjusting the default values of some encoder parameters in the s5p-mfc driver. The purpose of these changes is to improve the encoded output using the default settings.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The changes seem reasonable and aim to enhance the performance of the driver without introducing any major risks or regressions.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` and `.bus` fields for the `b53_spi_driver` structure in the DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) driver for the Linux kernel. The reason for this removal is that the `module_spi_driver()` function is used, which automatically sets these fields.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of these fields is justified since they are redundant and can be automatically set by the `module_spi_driver()` function. Removing redundant code can help improve code clarity and maintainability.

However, please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and its description. A more thorough review of the code and its impact on the overall system would be necessary for a final decision.

Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to make a definitive decision on whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Further analysis, including a detailed review of the patch and its impact, is necessary to make an informed decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward renaming of the function `pga_event` to `out_drv_event` in the ASoC twl6040 codec driver. The reason for the renaming is mentioned as the previous name being misleading.

Since this patch only involves a renaming and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally accepted in stable releases if they are not disruptive and do not introduce any regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds support for reading the micbias voltage from the device property, either from ACPI or Device Tree (DT). This allows for more flexibility in configuring the micbias voltage for the analog mic.

2. The patch introduces the "maxim,micbias" property, which specifies the valid voltage values for the micbias. This property provides clear documentation on the valid voltage options for the micbias.

3. In the max98090_probe() function, the patch reads the "maxim,micbias" property using device_property_read_u32(). If the property is not found, it falls back to a default value of 2.8v and prints an informational message.

4. The patch performs a range check on the micbias value. If the value is out of range, it logs an error message and sets the micbias to the default value of 2.8v.

5. Finally, the patch updates the micbias voltage using snd_soc_update_bits() with the micbias value obtained from the device property.

Overall, the patch adds support for configuring the micbias voltage based on the device property, provides clear documentation, and handles error cases appropriately. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there was a regression introduced by the commit d0b1252d in the file patch_hdmi.c. The pin NID assignment was not done correctly, causing the issue. 

The patch fixes this regression by correctly assigning the pin NID in the spec->pins[0].pin_nid field instead of spec->cvts[0].cvt_nid.

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it addresses a regression and fixes the incorrect pin NID assignment.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the assignment of the "owner" field in two platform drivers: "dcssblk" and "xpram". The "owner" field is typically used to keep track of the module that owns the driver.

In this case, the patch is removing the assignment of "THIS_MODULE" to the "owner" field in both drivers. This suggests that the drivers do not need to explicitly set the owner, as it will be populated by the driver core.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of the owner assignment does not seem to have any negative impact on the functionality of the drivers, and it aligns with the standard behavior of the driver core.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not take into account any potential dependencies or interactions with other parts of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a section mismatch warning in the sparc32 architecture for the function `leon_configure_cache_smp()`. The warning suggests that the function is referenced from `leon_callin()` in the `.cpuinit.text` section, but the actual implementation is in the `.init.text` section.

The patch resolves this warning by changing the function declaration of `leon_configure_cache_smp()` from `void __init` to `void __cpuinit`. This change ensures that the function is only called during CPU initialization and matches the section where it is defined.

Considering the patch addresses a warning and improves the code's correctness, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `ion_chunk_heap_create` function in the `ion_chunk_heap.c` file under the `drivers/staging/android/ion` directory. The change is to replace the `pr_info` call with `pr_debug` for printing the heap creation details.

The reason for this change is to ensure that success messages are logged at the appropriate debug level instead of the info level. This aligns with best practices for logging and helps maintain a cleaner and more efficient log output.

Since this change does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it is considered a clean-up or improvement patch. Such patches are generally accepted in -stable releases to enhance code quality and maintainability.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be defining the bit positions for the contiguous bit in the PTE and PMD structures for the arm64 architecture. The patch adds the definitions for the CONT_PTES and CONT_RANGE_OFFSET macros in the pgtable-hwdef.h header file.

Considering the nature of this patch, it seems to be a straightforward addition of definitions and does not involve any changes to the existing code logic or functionality. Therefore, it can be considered a safe and non-intrusive patch.

Given these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch marks the function `resiliency_test()` as `__init`, indicating that it should be placed in the `init.text` section. This section contains code that is only executed during the initialization phase of the kernel and is freed after boot. This change ensures that the `resiliency_test()` function is only called during the bootstrap process.

2. The patch includes the `Acked-by` tag from Christoph Lameter, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by him.

3. The patch also includes the `Signed-off-by` tags from multiple contributors, including Linus Torvalds, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch has undergone proper review and addresses a specific issue related to the `resiliency_test()` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices with SFPs. The patch includes changes to the `ixgbe_irq_enable` function in the `ixgbe_main.c` file.

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds necessary support for the SFP insertion interrupt on X550EM devices, which can improve the functionality and compatibility of the driver for these devices.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review and testing of the patch should be conducted to ensure it does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues with other hardware or software configurations.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes a redundant NULL check for the "brd" value in the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function. It states that the "brd" value cannot be NULL in this function because it was already checked for NULL as a parameter. Additionally, the dgnc_finalize_board_init() function is called only from the dgnc_found_board() function, and the brd->magic value is assigned once in dgnc_found_board(). Therefore, there is no need to check for the DGNC_BOARD_MAGIC value.

Removing the redundant NULL check improves code readability and eliminates unnecessary checks, making the code more efficient. As a result, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using the core function `irq_set_affinity` instead of a custom implementation for hotplug irq migration code. This change eliminates the need for an incomplete copy of `irq_set_affinity()`.

2. The patch also switches from `for_each_irq_desc()` to `for_each_active_irq()`, which is a more appropriate iterator for iterating over active IRQs.

3. The `route_irq()` function, which was previously used to set the affinity of an IRQ, is removed since it is no longer needed.

4. The `migrate_irqs()` function is modified to use `irq_set_affinity()` directly instead of calling `route_irq()`.

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the core function and a more appropriate iterator. It simplifies the code and removes unnecessary custom implementations. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch updates the `imp_known_replied_xid` when trying to resend an already replied replay request. This is done because the xid of the replay request could be less than the current `imp_known_replied_xid`.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a specific issue related to replaying requests and ensures that the `imp_known_replied_xid` is updated correctly. This update is necessary to maintain the integrity of the replay mechanism in the `ptlrpc` module.

2. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The changes are limited to the Misc.c file in the staging/bcm directory, which suggests that they are specific to the bcm staging driver.

4. The changes do not appear to introduce any potential issues or regressions. The affected functions, CopyBufferToControlPacket() and StatisticsResponse(), are updated to use "void *" instead of PVOID for the ioBuffer and pvBuffer parameters, respectively. This change is consistent with the expected type for these buffers.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward and beneficial change that improves code readability without introducing any known issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch introduces the use of platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions. These functions simplify the implementation of multi-driver modules and handle the failure to register one driver by unregistering all previously registered drivers. This is a beneficial change as it improves the robustness and maintainability of the code.

2. The patch updates the omap_drm_init() function to use platform_register_drivers() instead of individually registering each driver. This change reduces code duplication and makes the initialization process more concise and readable.

3. Similarly, the omap_drm_fini() function is updated to use platform_unregister_drivers() instead of individually unregistering each driver. This change ensures that all drivers are properly unregistered in case of module removal.

4. The patch also introduces a new drivers[] array that contains pointers to the drivers to be registered. This array is then passed to platform_register_drivers() and platform_unregister_drivers() functions. This approach allows for easy addition or removal of drivers in the future without modifying the initialization and cleanup code.

Overall, the patch improves code organization, simplifies driver registration and unregistration, and enhances the maintainability of the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the err_request_irq error label is being moved up in the code to reflect the execution of tasklet_init and irq_of_parse_and_map. This change ensures that the error handling is done in the correct order.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new flag, NFT_SET_EVAL, to the enum nft_set_flags in nf_tables.h. This flag indicates that the set contains expressions for evaluation.

2. In nf_tables_api.c, the patch adds support for the NFT_SET_EVAL flag in the nf_tables_newset function. It checks if the NFT_SET_EVAL flag is set in the flags parameter and returns -EOPNOTSUPP (operation not supported) if both NFT_SET_MAP and NFT_SET_EVAL flags are set simultaneously. This ensures that the set can only be used for either mapping or evaluation, but not both.

3. In nft_lookup.c, the patch adds a check to reject sets with the NFT_SET_EVAL flag in the nft_lookup_init function. This prevents binding of state tables to the lookup expression since it only deals with lookup and map operations.

Overall, the patch introduces a new flag to indicate sets containing expressions for evaluation and ensures that sets can only be used for either mapping or evaluation, but not both. It also prevents binding of state tables to the lookup expression. These changes enhance the functionality and maintain consistency in the nf_tables subsystem.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix or improvement for the ARM OMAP3 platform, specifically for the igep0020 board. The patch adapts to changes in the ehci-omap driver by using usbhs_init_phys() to register the PHY's RESET regulators and the NOP PHY devices.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is removing a superfluous check and a stray newline in the `octeon_i2c_test_iflg` function in the `i2c-octeon.c` file. 

The change in the patch is as follows:
```
-	return (octeon_i2c_ctl_read(i2c) & TWSI_CTL_IFLG) != 0;
+	return (octeon_i2c_ctl_read(i2c) & TWSI_CTL_IFLG);
```

This change modifies the return statement by removing the inequality check (`!= 0`) from the expression. 

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it removes a superfluous check and a stray newline, which can improve code readability and maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple change to make the `struct i40e_stats` const in the i40e_ethtool.c file. The change is aimed at reducing the size of the resulting object file.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch appears to fix a potential mis-interpretation of READ_TOPOLOGY reserved fields in the lpfc driver for SCSI. The changes made in the patch seem to address this issue by modifying the logic and conditions for certain operations related to the fc_eventTag, lpfc_mbx_read_top_mm, and LPFC_MENLO_MAINT.

The changes made in the patch seem to be correct and necessary to ensure proper handling of the fc_eventTag and lpfc_mbx_read_top_mm values. The patch also includes a check for the sli_rev value to ensure compatibility with older versions of the lpfc driver.

Overall, the patch seems to address a potential issue and the changes made appear to be correct. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves the validation of sysfs pm_qos_latency_tolerance.
2. The patch checks if the value can be converted to a signed 32-bit integer using the kstrtos32() function.
3. If the conversion is successful (kstrtos32() returns 0), the patch checks if the value is negative. If it is, the function returns -EINVAL, indicating an invalid input.
4. If the conversion fails (kstrtos32() returns a non-zero value), the patch checks for specific string values ("auto" or "any") and assigns the corresponding predefined value.
5. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, the patch adds a necessary validation check to prevent users from directly writing negative values, which could lead to incorrect behavior or system instability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the udp err handler in IPv6 for ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG to make it similar to the behavior in IPv4. In IPv4, when the machine receives an ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED message, the connected UDP socket will get an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket. However, this behavior is not present in IPv6.

The patch adds a check for ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG and updates the PMTU (Path MTU) for the socket. Additionally, if the socket's PMTU discovery is not set to IPV6_PMTUDISC_DONT, it sets the harderr flag to 1. This ensures that the connected UDP socket will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket.

The patch also adds a check for NDISC_REDIRECT and performs the necessary actions.

Finally, the patch handles the case when np->recverr is true. It checks if harderr is false or if the socket's state is not TCP_ESTABLISHED. If either condition is true, it skips further processing. Otherwise, it calls the ipv6_icmp_error function to handle the ICMP error.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a discrepancy in behavior between IPv4 and IPv6 for UDP sockets. It ensures that the connected UDP socket in IPv6 will receive an EMSGSIZE message on its next read from the socket when an ICMP6_PKT_TOOBIG message is received. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue pointed out by Linus at commit 07d106d0. This indicates that there is a known problem that needs to be fixed.

2. The patch fixes the error handling for the ENOIOCTLCMD error. It translates it to ENOTTY, which is the correct error code to be returned to user mode.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Alan Cox, indicating that it has undergone some level of peer review.

4. The patch is signed-off by the original author and Greg Kroah-Hartman, which adds credibility to its correctness and adherence to the Linux kernel development process.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the use of __devexit_p in the staging DRM driver for i.MX platforms. The reason for this removal is that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option, making __devexit_p no longer necessary.

Considering this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The removal of __devexit_p is justified, as it is no longer needed due to the removal of CONFIG_HOTPLUG. This change will help maintain compatibility and improve the stability of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch sets the led_classdev max_brightness to the maximum level supported by hardware. This eliminates the need for a brightness conversion operation in brightness_set(). This change can improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary calculations.

2. The patch removes the bright_max variable, which is no longer needed since the max_brightness value is now directly assigned to led_dat->cdev.max_brightness.

3. The netxbig_led_set() function is modified to directly set the brightness value without performing any calculations. This simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary operations.

4. The create_netxbig_led() function assigns the template->bright_max value to led_dat->cdev.max_brightness, ensuring that the maximum brightness level is correctly set during initialization.

Overall, the patch appears to improve efficiency and simplify the code without introducing any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `libata-scsi.c` file in the `drivers/ata` directory. It specifically modifies the `ata_scsiop_inq_std` function, which handles the standard INQUIRY SCSI command.

The purpose of the patch is to set the CmdQue (Command Queue) bit in the standard INQUIRY data to 1. This change aims to avoid a performance bottleneck when using SCSI pass-through to virtual machines with other operating systems (e.g., Windows) via virtio-scsi and scsi-block in QEMU.

The patch adds three additional values to the INQUIRY data structure: 0, 0, and 2. These values are added after the existing values in the structure.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific performance issue and provides compatibility improvements for SCSI pass-through to virtual machines. Therefore, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch updates the function `init_css()` to `init_and_link_css()`. This change moves the reference acquisition code into the `init_and_link_css()` function, making the code more readable and easier to follow.

The `init_and_link_css()` function initializes the new `css` (cgroup_subsys_state) structure by setting its `cgroup`, `ss`, and `flags` fields. Additionally, it acquires the reference counts for the parent cgroup and the current cgroup.

The `create_css()` function, which is called during the creation of a new cgroup, now uses the `init_and_link_css()` function instead of the old `init_css()` function. This ensures that the reference acquisition is done at the same time as the initialization of the `css` structure.

In the `cgroup_init_subsys()` function, the `init_and_link_css()` function is also used to initialize the `css` structure for the default root cgroup.

Overall, this patch improves code readability and ensures that reference acquisition is done consistently during the initialization of the `css` structure. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds the __init prefix to the prandom_start_seed_timer() function. This prefix indicates that the function is only called from other functions annotated with __init, which are executed during the kernel initialization phase. Adding __init to prandom_start_seed_timer() ensures that the kernel can make use of this hint and potentially free up resources after its usage.

2. The patch also renames the function to __prandom_start_seed_timer() to reflect its internal nature. This naming convention helps in distinguishing internal functions from externally accessible ones.

3. The patch modifies the prandom_reseed() function to call __prandom_start_seed_timer() instead of prandom_start_seed_timer(). This change ensures consistency and avoids any potential issues that may arise from calling an internal function from an __init function.

4. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Daniel Borkmann, Hannes Frederic Sowa, and David S. Miller, indicating that it has undergone review and approval by these individuals.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a reasonable and necessary improvement to the codebase. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch converts the code to use devm_ functions, which are managed by the kernel's resource management framework. This change reduces code size and simplifies the code by eliminating the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation.

The devm_kzalloc function is used to allocate memory for the adt7411_data structure. This function allocates memory that is automatically freed when the device is unregistered, eliminating the need for explicit memory deallocation.

The error handling in the probe function is also improved. Instead of using a goto statement to jump to the exit_free label, the patch returns the error code directly. This simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.

In the remove function, the kfree function is removed because the memory allocated with devm_kzalloc is automatically freed when the device is unregistered. This ensures proper resource cleanup and eliminates the possibility of memory leaks.

Overall, the patch improves code simplicity, reduces code size, and ensures proper resource management. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the use of `regmap_init_i2c()` with `devm_regmap_init_i2c()`. This change makes the regmap initialization device-managed, which simplifies error handling and code cleanup.

2. The patch fixes a potential bug by adding an explicit `regmap_exit` call, which was missing in the original code.

3. The patch has been signed-off by two contributors, Sachin Kamat and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change does not introduce any new functionality or behavior; it only improves the code by using a more appropriate function and fixing a potential bug.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `vmlinux_path__init` function in `tools/perf/util/symbol.c`. Here are the changes made by the patch:

1. Line 1757: The patch increases the size of the allocated memory for `vmlinux_path` from 5 to 6. This change suggests that an additional entry will be added to `vmlinux_path`.

2. Lines 1788-1794: The patch adds code to populate the additional entry in `vmlinux_path`. It constructs the path to the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file using the `kernel_version` variable and stores it in `vmlinux_path`. If the allocation or string duplication fails, it jumps to the `out_fail` label.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch adds support for the Ubuntu kernel debuginfo file, which can be useful for debugging purposes. The changes made by the patch appear to be correct and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential interactions or dependencies with other parts of the Linux kernel. A more comprehensive analysis would be required to fully assess the impact of this patch.
false || This Linux kernel patch is a trivial fix for a typo in the rtc-imxdi.c file. It corrects the spelling of "Temperatur" to "Temperature" in the DSR_TTD macro definition.

So, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch removes the `init()` and `exit()` platform callbacks in the `serial: imx` driver. It also removes the `moboard_uart0_init()` and `moboard_uart0_exit()` functions from the `mach-mx31moboard.c` file. Additionally, it removes the `init` and `exit` fields from the `uart0_pdata` structure in the same file.

In the `serial_imx_probe()` function in the `imx.c` file, the patch removes the call to `pdata->init(pdev)` and the corresponding error handling. It also removes the call to `uart_remove_one_port()` and the call to `pdata->exit(pdev)` in the `serial_imx_remove()` function.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch removes the initialization and cleanup code for the `uart0` device on the `mx31moboard` platform. It also removes the `init()` and `exit()` callbacks from the `imx` driver. However, it does not provide any alternative implementation or explanation for why these changes are being made.

Considering the lack of justification and alternative implementation, it is difficult to determine the intention behind these changes. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further clarification or a more comprehensive explanation is provided.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is intended to initialize the BBP_R103 register on various subroutines in the rt2800 driver. The patch adds code to set the value of BBP_R103 to 0xc0 in certain conditions, and to 0x00 in other conditions.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Patch Purpose: The patch aims to initialize the BBP_R103 register on different subroutines in the rt2800 driver. This suggests that it is intended to improve the functionality or stability of the driver.

2. Code Logic: The patch adds code to set the value of BBP_R103 based on specific conditions. This indicates that the patch is addressing specific hardware or firmware requirements for different chipsets.

3. Acked-by Tags: The patch has received Acked-by tags from multiple individuals, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch. This is a positive sign for the patch's acceptance.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch appears to address specific hardware requirements and has received positive reviews from multiple individuals. However, it is always recommended to further review the patch and conduct appropriate testing before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue in the VIDIOC_TRY_FMT function in the coda.c file of the media subsystem.
2. The issue is that the sizeimage field is incorrectly calculated as height * bytesperline, instead of width * height * 3 / 2.
3. The patch corrects the calculation by setting sizeimage as width * height * 3 / 2.
4. The patch also updates the vidioc_s_fmt function to use the sizeimage field directly instead of calculating it separately.
5. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the respective individuals.
6. The changes made by the patch are localized to the coda.c file and do not affect other parts of the kernel.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests using the devm_* APIs in the ad5504 driver of the iio subsystem. The devm_* APIs are device-managed APIs that simplify the code and handle resource management automatically. This improves the code's robustness and reduces the chances of resource leaks.

The patch replaces the allocation of the iio device using iio_device_alloc with devm_iio_device_alloc. This ensures that the iio device is automatically freed when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded, eliminating the need for manual cleanup.

Similarly, the patch replaces the usage of regulator_get and regulator_put with devm_regulator_get. This ensures that the regulator is automatically released when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

The patch also replaces the usage of request_threaded_irq and free_irq with devm_request_threaded_irq. This ensures that the interrupt is automatically freed when the device is unregistered or the driver is unloaded.

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the devm_* APIs, making it simpler and more robust. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to avoid taking the host lock in scsi_run_queue unless necessary. This optimization is beneficial when there are no starved devices, as there is no need to iterate over them.

2. The function scsi_run_queue is split into two parts: scsi_starved_list_run and scsi_run_queue. This separation improves code clarity and maintainability.

3. The scsi_starved_list_run function handles the logic of selecting a proper request queue to serve next when there are starved devices. It initializes a starved_list, locks the host, and performs the necessary operations.

4. The scsi_run_queue function is responsible for selecting a proper request queue to serve next when the previous command is completely finished. It first checks if the scsi_target has a single LUN and calls scsi_single_lun_run if true. Then, it checks if the starved_list is not empty and calls scsi_starved_list_run to handle the starved devices. Finally, it calls blk_run_queue to run the queue.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency of scsi_run_queue by avoiding unnecessary host lock acquisition and splitting the function for better code organization. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch suggests using `of_property_read_u32()` instead of manually finding and reading properties. This function simplifies the code and reduces the number of variables used.

2. The patch removes the variables `ct_prop` and `ci_prop` since they are no longer needed.

3. The `of_property_read_u32()` function is used to read the values of `ibm,842-coprocessor-type` and `ibm,842-coprocessor-instance` properties. If these properties are missing or cannot be read, an error is returned.

4. The values of `ct` and `ci` are no longer obtained from the `ct_prop` and `ci_prop` variables but are directly assigned using `of_property_read_u32()`.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the existing behavior. It only improves the code by using a more concise and efficient method for reading properties.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions in the i40e driver. The changes ensure that these functions are not used when the VLAN ID (VID) is less than 1 or when the Port VLAN ID (PVID) is set. This is achieved by adding a check for VID and PVID before executing the respective functions.

The patch also updates the function signatures to use u16 instead of s16 for the VID parameter since the functions no longer expect to be called with VID=I40E_VLAN_ANY.

The changes aim to improve the handling of VLAN mode and prevent accidental invocation of VLAN mode handling when VID=0 or VID=-1. By removing unnecessary checks and ensuring proper usage of the functions, the patch enhances the stability and reliability of the i40e driver.

Considering the nature of the changes and their positive impact on the driver's behavior, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. The change removes the unnecessary check for 'sk' being NULL before calling sock_get_timestamp(). This is because 'sk' is already unconditionally dereferenced via lock_sock(sk) earlier in the function.

The patch also mentions that the caller, sock_do_ioctl(), takes similar liberties, indicating that the NULL check is redundant.

The reported-by field indicates that the issue was identified by Dan Carpenter, and the patch is signed-off by David S. Miller.

Overall, the change seems reasonable and removes unnecessary code. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing an error return code in the `cpia1.c` file of the `gspca` driver in the `media` subsystem.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch improves code readability and maintainability by replacing a macro with local variables and using a helper function. Additionally, the changes do not introduce any new functionality or potential issues.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be necessary before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new property called "phy-reset-duration" for device tree probe. This property allows boards to specify a longer reset duration for the phy if needed. This is a useful addition as different boards may require different reset durations.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the "phy-reset-duration" property is only used if the "phy-reset-gpios" property is available. This ensures that the reset duration is only applied when the phy reset GPIO is present.

3. The patch sets a default reset duration of 1 millisecond if the "phy-reset-duration" property is not specified or if the value is greater than 1000 (which is considered invalid). This ensures that a reasonable default value is used in such cases.

4. The patch modifies the "fec_reset_phy" function to read the "phy-reset-duration" property and use it as the reset duration. The function also includes a comment stating that a sane reset duration should not be longer than 1 second.

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch adds a useful feature and includes proper checks and defaults to ensure correct behavior. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to convert the comedi_subdevice access from pointer math to array access in the pcmad driver of the staging subsystem. This change replaces the line `s = dev->subdevices + 0;` with `s = &dev->subdevices[0];`.

The change improves code readability and maintainability by using array access instead of pointer arithmetic. It also aligns with the coding style used in the Linux kernel.

Since this patch does not introduce any functional changes and only improves code readability, it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch constifies the `nct7802_regmap_config` struct by adding the `const` keyword. This indicates that the struct is not modified by the driver and can be safely treated as read-only. The `regmap_init()` function, which is used to initialize the regmap, accepts a pointer to a const struct, making this change appropriate.

By constifying the struct, it helps enforce immutability and improves code clarity. It also ensures that accidental modifications to the struct are prevented, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Therefore, this patch is a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch improves interrupt handling in the meson-gx-mmc driver.
2. Previously, interrupts were disabled and immediately re-enabled in the meson_mmc_request function, which didn't provide any benefit. The patch removes this unnecessary disable/enable sequence.
3. Instead, interrupts are now enabled in the probe function, which is a more appropriate place to enable interrupts.
4. Additionally, the patch adds the missing disable interrupts sequence in the remove function, ensuring proper interrupt handling during device removal.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Heiner Kallweit and Kevin Hilman, indicating that it has undergone a review process.
6. The patch modifies the meson-gx-mmc.c file.

Overall, the patch improves interrupt handling in the meson-gx-mmc driver and addresses a missing disable interrupts issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is removing the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb_probe() function in the staging/xgifb/XGI_main_26.c file. The reason for this change is that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option, so the __devinit attribute is no longer needed.

In the Linux kernel, the __devinit attribute is used to mark functions that are only called during device initialization and are not needed after that. This attribute allows the kernel to discard the function code after initialization, reducing memory usage.

Since CONFIG_HOTPLUG is being removed, it implies that the device initialization code will always be present, and there is no need to mark the xgifb_probe() function with __devinit anymore.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix for a compile warning in the ARM architecture related to the psci_init function. The patch changes the function to return 0, which resolves the warning.

1. The patch removes unnecessary checks in the KVM MMU code, specifically in the functions `mmu_need_write_protect` and `kvm_mmu_pte_write`.

2. In `mmu_need_write_protect`, the patch removes the check for `need_unsync` and `s->unsync` when `s->role.level` is not `PT_PAGE_TABLE_LEVEL`. This change simplifies the code and ensures that `need_unsync` is always set to true when `s->unsync` is true.

3. In `kvm_mmu_pte_write`, the patch removes the check for `remote_flush` when calling `need_remote_flush`. This change ensures that `remote_flush` is always set to true when `need_remote_flush` returns true.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only removes unnecessary checks, which can improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a clean and safe improvement to the KVM MMU code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The change is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only optimizes the existing code by eliminating duplicate function calls.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Paulo Zanoni and reviewed by Matt Roper, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

4. The patch includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website, providing additional context and discussion about the patch.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid optimization that does not introduce any regressions or issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a straightforward change that removes a redundant type casting. Since the conversion from a void pointer to any other pointer type is guaranteed by the C programming language, the casting is unnecessary.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the powerpc/kernel/cacheinfo.c file in the Linux kernel. It aims to make device tree accesses in the cache info code endian safe.

The changes in the patch involve replacing the usage of u32 pointers with __be32 pointers for cache_size, line_size, and nr_sets variables. Additionally, the of_read_number() function is used to read the values from the device tree properties.

The patch ensures that the cache size, line size, and number of sets are read correctly regardless of the endianness of the system.

Overall, the patch appears to be a necessary fix to ensure proper handling of device tree properties in the cache info code for powerpc architecture. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the "struct musb *musb" member from the "struct tusb_omap_dma" structure. This member is no longer needed and can be safely removed.

2. The patch updates the code to use the "musb" member from the "dma_controller" structure instead of the removed "musb" member from "tusb_omap_dma" structure. This ensures that the correct "musb" pointer is used throughout the code.

3. The patch also updates the "tusb_dma_controller_create" function to assign the "musb" pointer to the "musb" member of the "dma_controller" structure. This ensures that the "musb" pointer is properly initialized.

Overall, the patch cleans up the code by removing an unnecessary member and ensures that the correct "musb" pointer is used. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests making the functions `dst_cache_per_cpu_dst_set()` and `dst_cache_per_cpu_get()` static. These functions are currently defined as global functions in the `dst_cache.c` file.

By making these functions static, their visibility will be limited to the `dst_cache.c` file only. This is beneficial because it reduces the risk of unintentional usage or modification of these functions from other parts of the codebase, which can lead to potential bugs or inconsistencies.

Additionally, making these functions static can improve code maintainability and readability by clearly indicating that these functions are intended for internal use within the `dst_cache.c` file.

Therefore, considering the benefits of limiting the visibility of these functions and improving code maintainability, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix for lines exceeding 80 characters in the serqt_usb2.c file. The patch also includes some formatting changes to improve readability.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be categorized as a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are necessary for code readability or maintainability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a bug fix or an enhancement to ensure proper functionality of the mentioned devices. Therefore, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch and its impact on the system is necessary before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where an info message is printed with the name 'uninitialised' if the netdev is not registered before connecting the phy. By registering the netdev first and then connecting the phy, this issue can be avoided.

The patch moves the call to `dsa_slave_phy_setup()` after registering the netdev. This ensures that the phy setup is only performed after the netdev is registered successfully. If the phy setup fails, an error message is printed, and the slave device is freed.

This change improves the code logic and prevents the 'uninitialised' name issue. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any broader context or dependencies.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid and reasonable change. The patch suggests using the time_before function instead of directly comparing jiffies with a timeout value. This change is recommended for better robustness when comparing jiffies against other values.

Considering the patch's simplicity and the fact that it improves the code's reliability, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the struct kbtab to include a new member `struct usb_interface *intf`. This change is made to align the struct with the USB device, which is considered more appropriate for this driver.

2. The `kbtab_irq` function is modified to use `kbtab->intf->dev` instead of `dev->dev` for logging messages related to urb status. This ensures that the correct USB interface device is used for logging.

3. Similarly, the `kbtab_irq` function is modified to use `kbtab->intf->dev` instead of `dev->dev` for logging error messages related to `usb_submit_urb` failure.

4. In the `kbtab_probe` function, the `kbtab->intf` member is assigned the value of `intf`, which is the USB interface being probed. This allows the driver to access the USB interface later if needed.

Overall, the patch appears to fix and improve the logging and error handling in the `kbtab` driver. It aligns the struct with the USB device and ensures that the correct USB interface device is used for logging and error messages. These changes are beneficial and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of BUG_ON macro from the mmc_ext_csd_open function in debugfs.c. The use of BUG_ON is replaced with proper error handling.

2. Instead of triggering a BUG_ON, the patch introduces an error variable 'err' and sets it to -EINVAL if the condition 'n != EXT_CSD_STR_LEN' is true.

3. The error value is then propagated to the caller by jumping to the 'out_free' label, where the allocated memory is freed before returning the error value.

The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by commit c5b367835cfc, which added support for XPA in MIPS architecture. The problem arises from the assumption of constant offsets for _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE relative to _PAGE_PRESENT, which is no longer true for some MIPS32R2 builds due to commit be0c37c985ed.

The patch proposes a fix by using the _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_WRITE definitions to calculate the correct mask instead of hardcoding values. This ensures that the correct bits are masked and xored to obtain the desired result.

The Fixes tag references the commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear link to the problem being addressed. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Considering the patch's clear purpose, the fix it provides, and the appropriate references, it seems suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the `gb_tty_probe` function by changing the way the `gb_tty` driver data is stored in the `greybus_device` structure. Instead of using the `greybus_set_drvdata` function, it directly assigns the `gb_tty` pointer to `gdev->gb_tty`. This change ensures that the `gb_tty` driver data is properly tied into the `gb_core`.

2. The patch also modifies the `gb_tty_disconnect` function by changing the way the `gb_tty` driver data is retrieved from the `greybus_device` structure. Instead of using the `greybus_get_drvdata` function, it directly assigns the `gb_tty` pointer to `gdev->gb_tty`. This change ensures that the `gb_tty` driver data is correctly accessed during the disconnect process.

3. Additionally, the patch updates the error handling code in `gb_tty_probe` to properly handle the failure case. It sets `gdev->gb_tty` to `NULL` and releases the minor number before returning an error. This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up in case of failure.

Overall, the patch improves the handling of the `gb_tty` driver data and enhances error handling. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch introduces a new constant `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` with a value of 16, representing the fixed block size of the LRW algorithm.

2. The patch replaces the usage of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` with `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` in multiple places within the `lrw.c` file.

3. The `setkey()` function now uses `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` to determine the block size of the cipher.

4. The `crypt()` function also uses `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` instead of `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` to determine the block size of the cipher.

5. The `init_tfm()` function checks if the block size of the cipher is equal to `LRW_BLOCK_SIZE` (16) instead of a hardcoded value of 16.

Overall, the patch improves code readability and maintainability by using a constant for the fixed block size of the LRW algorithm. It eliminates the need for calling `crypto_cipher_blocksize()` multiple times, reducing potential errors and improving performance.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to drop references to "virtual" IRQ in the mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_map function. It renames the argument "virq" to "irq" since the IRQ is not any more "virtual" than any other Linux IRQ number. The patch also updates the function calls to use the new argument name.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple fix for warnings reported by the compiler. The patch changes the loop counter variable from a signed integer to an unsigned integer in three functions: `pt_regs_to_gdb_regs()`, `gdb_regs_to_pt_regs()`, and `sleeping_thread_to_gdb_regs()`.

The warnings reported by the compiler are related to comparisons between signed and unsigned integer expressions. By changing the loop counter variable to an unsigned type, the patch resolves these warnings.

Considering that this patch only addresses compiler warnings and does not introduce any functional changes, it can be considered safe for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

1. The patch addresses a warning generated during the kernel build process. It aims to resolve the warning by marking the function 'ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg' as static.

2. The function 'ql4_84xx_ipmdio_rd_reg' is only used within the file where it is declared. Therefore, it does not require a declaration and can be made static.

3. The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Nilesh Javali, who is associated with the QLogic company, which suggests that the patch has been tested and verified by the relevant stakeholders.

4. The patch also includes the Signed-off-by tags from Baoyou Xie and Martin K. Petersen, indicating their agreement and responsibility for the patch.

false || Based on the provided patch, it introduces two new knobs, "idgen_retries" and "idgen_delay," to the IPv6 subsystem. These knobs are specified by RFC 7217. The patch modifies the netns_sysctl_ipv6 structure in include/net/netns/ipv6.h to include these new knobs.

In the addrconf_dad_failure function in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, the patch retrieves the net namespace and uses the new knobs to determine the number of retries and delay for address generation. Similarly, in the ipv6_generate_stable_address function, the patch retrieves the net namespace and uses the "idgen_retries" knob to determine the maximum number of retries for generating a stable address.

The patch also adds initialization of the "idgen_retries" and "idgen_delay" knobs in the inet6_net_init function in net/ipv6/af_inet6.c. Additionally, it adds the corresponding sysctl entries for these knobs in the ipv6_table_template and ipv6_sysctl_net_init functions in net/ipv6/sysctl_net_ipv6.c.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch introduces necessary functionality and follows the RFC specifications. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code refactoring. The patch moves the declaration of `bpf_jit_enable` from `netdevice.h` to `filter.h` where most other core code is declared. This change is done to accommodate the addition of a second knob.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs, it can be categorized as a clean-up or organizational change. Such changes are generally accepted in stable releases as they improve code maintainability and readability without introducing any risks.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of auto-mute or auto-mic functionality being triggered when a jack is retasked as a different direction. For example, if a mic jack is used as a CLFE (Center, LFE) output, it shouldn't be counted as the target for automatic jack switching.

The patch modifies the `detect_jacks` function to skip the automute or autoswitch when the current pinctl (pin control) direction is different from what is expected. It checks if the pin is retasked as an input and continues to the next pin if it is.

Similarly, the `snd_hda_gen_mic_autoswitch` function is modified to skip the detection of pins retasked as outputs. It checks if the pin is retasked as an output and continues to the next entry if it is.

Overall, the patch ensures that retasked jacks are not mistakenly considered for automatic jack switching, preventing unwanted behavior.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is adding a missing cmpxchg64() function if CONFIG_RMW_INSNS=y. This suggests that the patch is addressing a specific configuration scenario.

2. The error message indicates an implicit declaration of the cmpxchg64() function, which means it is not defined or declared before being used.

3. The patch maps cmpxchg64 to cmpxchg64_local, which is already mapped to __cmpxchg64_local_generic. This ensures that the function is properly defined and available for use.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes in the arch/m68k/include/asm/cmpxchg.h file.

Considering these points, it appears that the patch is fixing a compilation error by adding the missing cmpxchg64() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of calculating the location of query 8 in the HID RMI driver for touchpads. Previously, the location was hardcoded, assuming the presence of query 6 and query 10. However, if a touchpad does not report relative data, query 6 will not be present, and the address of query 8 will be one less.

The patch modifies the code to calculate the location of query 8 dynamically based on the presence of query registers. It first checks if the touchpad has gestures by examining the relevant bit in the buffer. If gestures are present, it reads query 8 to determine if query 10 exists. Then, it adjusts the query offset accordingly.

This change ensures that the code correctly handles touchpads without relative data and adapts to the actual presence of query registers. It improves the reliability and compatibility of the HID RMI driver.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch moves the 64-bit feature fixup earlier in the code, specifically to the `early_setup()` function. This change ensures that the feature fixups are applied before turning on the MMU, which can have an impact on MMU management and interrupts. This aligns the behavior of 64-bit with what is already done in 32-bit.

2. The patch adds a call to `apply_feature_fixups()` in the `early_setup()` function. This function applies all the dynamic patching, which is necessary for proper feature handling.

3. The patch removes the call to `apply_feature_fixups()` from the `setup_system()` function. This function is responsible for setting up the system and unflattening the device-tree, but it is not the appropriate place for applying feature fixups.

Overall, the patch improves the order of operations by applying the feature fixups earlier in the code, ensuring they are applied before turning on the MMU. This change is necessary for proper feature handling and aligns the behavior of 64-bit with 32-bit. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the zl10353_read_snr() function in the zl10353.c file of the media subsystem. This function is responsible for reading the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) value from the zl10353 frontend.

2. The patch changes the way the SNR value is reported. Previously, the SNR was reported using raw hardware register values. The patch updates it to report the SNR in a 0.1 dB scale.

3. The change is made by modifying the assignment of the *snr variable. Instead of directly assigning the _snr value, the patch multiplies it by 10 and divides by 8. This conversion ensures that the SNR is reported in a 0.1 dB scale.

4. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors who made the changes.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and straightforward improvement to the zl10353 frontend driver. It introduces a more meaningful representation of the SNR value, which can be beneficial for users and applications that rely on this information. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Therefore, the correct decision for this patch would be (A) to accept it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a build error that occurs when the CONFIG_OF configuration option is not set. It defines the missing symbol 'rspi_of_match' as NULL when CONFIG_OF is not enabled, preventing the build error from occurring. This fix allows the code to compile correctly in both cases, with and without CONFIG_OF.

Additionally, the patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Therefore, this patch is a valid fix for the build error and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a possible issue with the if test in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi.c file. The current if test checks if the sscanf function does not return 1 and if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the intended logic might be to check if the mode is not equal to 2 and not equal to 1.

To clarify, the current if test is as follows:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 && (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

The proposed change is as follows:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 || (mode != 2 && mode != 1))
```

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) as it fixes the potential issue with the if test.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code modification that replaces the direct assignment of `master->bits_per_word_mask` with the `SPI_BPW_MASK` macro in two different files (`spi-bfin-v3.c` and `spi-ti-qspi.c`). 

The `SPI_BPW_MASK` macro is used to set the bits per word mask for the SPI master. It takes the number of bits per word as an argument and returns the corresponding mask value. This change makes the code more readable and maintainable by using a macro instead of hardcoding the mask values.

Considering the nature of this patch, it seems to be a safe and beneficial change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a debug print enhancement for vring de-allocation in the wil6210 driver. The patch adds debug messages to print information about the vring being freed, including its index, size, virtual address, physical address, and context.

Debug prints are typically used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes and are not critical for the normal operation of the driver. Therefore, this patch can be considered as a non-functional change that does not affect the stability or functionality of the driver.

Considering the nature of the patch, it is not necessary for stable releases. Debug prints are usually added during development or debugging phases and are not typically included in stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

5. The patch also includes a change to the brcmf_dongle_memsize variable, which is overridden if possible. This change seems to be unrelated to the main purpose of the patch and may require further investigation.

Overall, the patch appears to improve code organization, remove unused variables, and introduce new variables in a proper manner. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_enable/disable` with `clk_prepare_enable/disable_unprepare` functions. This change is made to avoid common clock framework warnings.

2. The patch introduces error handling for the new clock enable calls. If `clk_prepare_enable` fails, it jumps to the `out` label and disables the previously enabled clock before returning the error code.

3. Similarly, in the `atmel_usba_stop` function, the patch replaces `clk_disable` with `clk_disable_unprepare` to properly handle clock disabling.

4. In the `usba_udc_probe` function, the patch introduces error handling for `clk_prepare_enable` and `clk_disable_unprepare` calls. If `clk_prepare_enable` fails, it logs an error message and jumps to the `err_clk_enable` label to clean up resources before returning the error code.

Overall, the patch improves the handling of clock enable and disable operations by using the appropriate functions from the common clock framework and introducing proper error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a clean-up patch that removes the use of __func__ from dev_err logging in the gdm72xx staging driver. The patch replaces __func__ with a generic error message.

In general, clean-up patches that improve code readability and maintainability are usually accepted in stable releases. However, it is important to consider the impact of the patch on the stability and functionality of the driver.

In this case, the patch does not seem to introduce any functional changes or affect the stability of the driver. It simply removes the specific instance of the device from the error message. As long as the error message still provides sufficient information for debugging purposes, this change should not cause any issues.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the final fixups from the __init section to the __devinit section. This change is necessary because final fixups are executed during device enumeration, which may occur after boot if hotplug is supported. Therefore, final fixups cannot be in the __init section.

2. The patch includes a changelog entry, which is a good practice for documenting the changes made.

3. The patch is signed-off by the original author, Myron Stowe, and Bjorn Helgaas, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch modifies the quirk_amd_nb_node function in the arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c file. The function is currently defined as __init, but the patch changes it to __devinit, which is appropriate for device-specific initialization code.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new function called `check_flush_dependency` which is responsible for checking the sanity of flush dependencies.
2. The `check_flush_dependency` function is called in two places: `flush_workqueue` and `start_flush_work`.
3. The purpose of the `check_flush_dependency` function is to verify that the current task or work item is not trying to flush a non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue or one of its work items.
4. If the target workqueue does not have the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set, the function performs the following checks:
   a. It checks if the current task has the PF_MEMALLOC flag set, which indicates that it is reclaiming memory. If so, it triggers a warning.
   b. It checks if the current task is running on a workqueue that has the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag set. If so, it triggers a warning.
5. The warnings triggered by the `check_flush_dependency` function help detect potential deadlocks caused by memory reclaim trying to flush non-WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueues or work items.
6. The patch also adds a call to `check_flush_dependency` in `flush_workqueue` and `start_flush_work` to ensure that the flush dependencies are checked before flushing the workqueue or work item.

7. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes, but rather improves the existing logic.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the tas5086 codec driver without any apparent issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch is removing the attach option to disable DMA in the addi-data drivers. Currently, the driver uses the comedi legacy attach mechanism, which allows users to pass configuration options to the driver during attachment to the comedi subsystem. However, the use of these configuration options is preventing the conversion of the addi-data drivers to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

The patch suggests removing the configuration option and enabling DMA if it is supported by default. It removes the code that checks the option[2] value and sets the i_Dma variable accordingly. Instead, it directly uses this_board->i_Dma to determine whether to enable DMA or not.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary configuration option and enables DMA if it is supported by default. This change aligns with the goal of converting the addi-data drivers to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

Please note that this recommendation is based solely on the provided information. A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire Linux kernel codebase is necessary before final acceptance.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

3. The purpose of this change is to increment the reference count of the device to prevent it from being removed while it is being checked to see if it is attached to the driver.

4. After the device is checked, the patch calls `comedi_dev_put()` to decrement the reference count.

5. The patch ensures that the reference count is properly managed, preventing potential issues with device removal during the check.

6. The patch has been signed-off by Ian Abbott and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address a potential issue and improves the stability of the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be adding device IDs for additional Chelsio adapters to the cxgb4 driver in the Linux kernel. This patch is adding new entries to the `cxgb4_pci_tbl` table, which is used to match the PCI device IDs with the corresponding driver.

Considering that the patch is adding support for new Chelsio adapters, it is likely that these adapters were not previously supported by the cxgb4 driver. By adding the device IDs for these adapters, the driver will be able to recognize and support them.

Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it enhances the functionality of the cxgb4 driver by adding support for additional Chelsio adapters.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward conversion of the onyx and tas codec drivers to use the `module_i2c_driver()` macro. This macro simplifies the code and reduces its size. 

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function call, `xgpu_ai_mailbox_set_irq_funcs(adev)`, in the `soc15_common_early_init` function. This function is only called if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This change seems to be related to implementing the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics.

2. The patch also adds a new function, `soc15_common_late_init`, which is called in the `late_init` field of the `amd_ip_funcs` structure. This function is only called if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This change appears to be part of the late initialization process for soc15 asics.

3. Another new function, `soc15_common_sw_init`, is added and called in the `sw_init` field of the `amd_ip_funcs` structure. Similar to the previous changes, this function is only called if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This change seems to be related to software initialization for soc15 asics.

4. The `soc15_common_hw_fini` function is modified to include a new function call, `xgpu_ai_mailbox_put_irq(adev)`, which is only executed if `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returns true. This change appears to be part of the hardware finalization process for soc15 asics.

5. The `late_init` field in the `amd_ip_funcs` structure is updated to point to the `soc15_common_late_init` function.

Overall, the patch introduces necessary changes for implementing the sr-iov mailbox for soc15 asics. It adds new function calls and modifies existing functions to handle the initialization and finalization processes. Since the changes are specific to soc15 asics and are conditional on `amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev)` returning true, they should not affect other hardware configurations. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward cleanup patch that removes unused #defines in the powerpc/xmon/xmon.c file. The removed #defines are REGS_PER_LINE and LAST_VOLATILE.

3. The patch includes signed-off-by statements from multiple contributors, including Alexey Khoroshilov, Johannes Thumshirn, and Greg Kroah-Hartman, which adds credibility to the patch.
4. The patch adds the necessary error handling code by setting the ret variable to -ENODEV when there is no PCI resource, ensuring that the error is properly handled.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the identified issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the ASoC (Audio System on Chip) driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds the missing OUT register for SRC_BUSIF_MODE in the rsnd_gen2_probe function. The IN register was already being set, but the OUT register was not.

The patch also updates the register names in the rsnd_reg enum and the rsnd_regmap_field_conf structure to reflect the changes.

Additionally, the rsnd_src_set_convert_rate function is modified to set both the IN and OUT registers for SRC_BUSIF_MODE.

Considering that the patch fixes a missing register setting and does not have any hardware effects, it seems reasonable to include it in the stable release. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to simplify the `drm_sysfs_destroy()` function by replacing the condition `(drm_class == NULL) || (IS_ERR(drm_class))` with the `IS_ERR_OR_NULL(drm_class)` macro. This macro is commonly used in the kernel for cleanup paths.

The change improves code readability and reduces redundancy by using a single macro instead of two separate conditions. It also aligns with the kernel's coding style and conventions.

Since this patch simplifies the code without introducing any new functionality or potential issues, it can be considered safe for inclusion in stable releases.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch adds reference counting to nfs4_preprocess_confirmed_seqid_op in nfs4state.c. It also includes a FIXME comment suggesting moving the atomic increment operation into nfs4_preprocess_seqid_op.

Additionally, the patch modifies the nfsd4_open_downgrade function by adding a new label (put_stateid) and a call to nfs4_put_stid to release the stateid. It also changes the existing "goto out" statements to "goto put_stateid" in case of certain conditions.

Furthermore, the patch modifies the nfsd4_lock function by introducing a new variable (open_stp) and adding a call to nfs4_put_stid to release the open stateid.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch introduces necessary changes to ensure proper reference counting and stateid release. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward change to staticize local symbols in the `dcp.c` file of the crypto subsystem. The patch makes the following modifications:

1. Changes the declaration of `global_dev` from a non-static symbol to a static symbol.
2. Changes the declaration of `dcp_dma_unmap` from a non-static function to a static function.
3. Changes the declaration of `dcp_dma_map` from a non-static function to a static function.
4. Changes the declaration of `dcp_watchdog` from a non-static function to a static function.

These changes make the symbols and functions local to the `dcp.c` file, as they are only referenced within that file. This improves encapsulation and reduces the risk of symbol clashes or unintended usage.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the local variable 'status' from the function lancer_cmd_get_file_len() in the be_ethtool.c file. The function uses lancer_cmd_read_object() to get the current size of registers for ethtool registers dump. The returned status value is stored in the 'status' variable but is not checked. However, the check itself is not necessary as the 'data_read' output variable is initialized to 0. Therefore, the 'status' variable can be safely removed.

The patch has been signed-off by Ivan Vecera and David S. Miller, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Overall, the patch seems to be a simple and straightforward improvement that removes unnecessary code. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the 'const' qualifier to the 'data' parameter in the 'send_to_group' function and the 'fsnotify' function. This change indicates that the 'data' parameter is not modified within these functions, ensuring better code safety and preventing accidental modifications.

2. The 'send_to_group' function is used to send notifications to all registered fsnotify groups. The 'data' parameter is now marked as const, indicating that it is read-only and not modified within the function.

3. The 'fsnotify' function is the main entry point for sending events. The 'data' parameter is also marked as const, indicating that it is not modified within the function.

4. The 'fsnotify' function is declared in 'include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h' and defined in 'fs/notify/fsnotify.c'. Both the declaration and definition are updated to reflect the const qualification of the 'data' parameter.

5. In the 'include/linux/fsnotify_backend.h' file, the declaration of the 'fsnotify' function is updated to include the const qualifier for the 'data' parameter.

6. In the 'fs/notify/fsnotify.c' file, the definition of the 'fsnotify' function is updated to include the const qualifier for the 'data' parameter.

7. In the 'fs/notify/fsnotify.c' file, the 'fsnotify' function checks the 'data_is' parameter to determine the type of 'data' being passed. If 'data_is' is FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH, the 'data' parameter is cast to a const struct path pointer to ensure that it is treated as read-only.

8. In the 'fs/notify/fsnotify.c' file, the 'fsnotify' function initializes the 'mnt' variable as NULL when 'data_is' is not FSNOTIFY_EVENT_PATH, indicating that 'data' is not used in that case.

Overall, the patch adds const qualifiers to the 'data' parameter in relevant functions, ensuring better code safety and preventing accidental modifications. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch is signed-off by the author and co-authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

2. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the blackfin: bf60x clock driver. It modifies the clk_round_rate() function to return 0 upon an error instead of a negative error code.

3. The reason for this change is explained in the patch description. The clk_round_rate() function is being changed to return an unsigned type because some clock sources can generate rates higher than (2^31)-1 Hz.

4. The change itself is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions.

5. The modified code is properly formatted and does not introduce any coding style violations.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a documentation fix and a minor adjustment to the function declaration in the drm/gem module. Since it does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered a low-risk change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch removes the unnecessary `spi_message` and `spi_message_add_tail` code, which simplifies the implementation.

4. The `spi_sync_transfer()` function is used with the appropriate parameters (`st->us` and `&xfer`) to perform the SPI transfer.

5. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves the code by utilizing a standard helper function.

Based on these observations, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement that simplifies the code without introducing any potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for a typo in the code. The patch changes the variable name from "mute_led_nid" to "cap_mute_led_nid" in the function alc269_fixup_hp_cap_mic_mute_hook() in the file sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c.

Considering that this is a simple typo fix and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions, it is safe to conclude that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to turn off the voltage for thermistors by asking the MSIC (Multifunction System-on-Chip) to turn it off. This is expected to save power.

2. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Mika Westerberg, Kirill A. Shutemov, Alan Cox, Durgadoss R, and H. Peter Anvin. This indicates that it has undergone review and approval from experienced individuals.

3. The patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), providing additional context and transparency.

4. The code changes in the patch modify the `mid_initialize_adc` function in the `intel_mid_thermal.c` file. The existing code checks if the `MSIC_ADCTHERM_MASK` is already set and emits a warning. The patch replaces this check with code that clears the `MSIC_ADCTHERM_MASK` and writes the updated value to the `INTEL_MSIC_ADC1CNTL3` register.

5. The patch also handles the return value of the `intel_msic_reg_write` function, ensuring that any errors during the write operation are properly handled.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement that addresses a power-saving issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the iio: pressure: mpl3115 driver. It introduces the use of claim/release helper functions to ensure that the device stays in direct mode during raw reads. Previously, the driver was checking for direct mode but not locking it, which could lead to inconsistencies.

The patch modifies the `mpl3115_read_raw` function by adding the `iio_device_claim_direct_mode` function call before performing raw reads. If the claim is successful, the function proceeds with the raw read operations for pressure and temperature values. If any error occurs during the read, the function breaks out of the switch case and returns the error code.

After the raw read operations, the patch adds the `iio_device_release_direct_mode` function call to release the direct mode claim. Finally, the function returns the appropriate value based on the channel type.

Overall, the patch improves the reliability and correctness of the mpl3115 driver by properly handling direct mode during raw reads. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup error codes in hv.c." This suggests that it aims to improve error handling in the vmbus driver.

2. The patch includes changes to the `hv_post_message` function in `hv.c`. This function is responsible for posting a message to the Hyper-V host.

3. In the original code, if the payload size exceeds the maximum allowed size (`HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT`), the function returns -1. This is not a descriptive error code and does not provide any information about the error.

4. The patch replaces the return value of -1 with the `EMSGSIZE` error code. `EMSGSIZE` indicates that the message size is too large. This change provides a more meaningful error code, making it easier to understand and handle the error.

5. Additionally, the patch also handles the case where memory allocation fails (`kmalloc` returns NULL). In the original code, it returns -1, which again does not provide any specific information about the error. The patch changes the return value to `ENOMEM`, which indicates a memory allocation failure.

6. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only improves error handling by using more descriptive error codes.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to error handling in the vmbus driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses the issue of potentially dropped characters at close due to the missing chars_in_buffer implementation. This indicates that the patch aims to fix a specific problem.

2. The patch includes the implementation of the sierra_chars_in_buffer function, which calculates the number of characters in the buffer. This function is necessary to accurately determine the number of characters present and prevent data loss.

3. The implementation of sierra_chars_in_buffer takes into account the outstanding_urbs (USB Request Blocks) and the MAX_TRANSFER value to calculate the number of characters. This approach ensures that the count is as accurate as possible, even though it may slightly overcount.

4. The patch also adds the sierra_chars_in_buffer function to the usb_serial_driver structure, indicating that it is intended to be used by the USB serial driver for Sierra devices.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a necessary implementation to prevent data loss. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple static declaration change for the `rx51_aux_dev` structure in the `rx51.c` file of the ASoC (Audio for System on Chip) subsystem. The patch changes the declaration from a global symbol to a static symbol.

Considering the nature of the change, it seems safe and reasonable to include this patch in the Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to optimize the calculation of averages in the cpuidle menu governor by using shifts instead of do_div when the divisor is a power of two. This optimization is expected to improve performance.

2. The patch introduces a new macro `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating the intervals. It is set to 3, which means the intervals will be calculated as `1UL << 3`, resulting in 8 intervals.

3. The `do_div` function is replaced with a shift operation (`>>`) when the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`. This shift operation is equivalent to dividing by `INTERVALS` since `INTERVALS` is a power of two.

4. Similarly, the `do_div` function is replaced with a shift operation when calculating the standard deviation if the divisor is equal to `INTERVALS`.

5. The patch includes appropriate comments explaining the purpose of the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be a performance optimization that simplifies the calculation of averages and standard deviation in the cpuidle menu governor. It does not introduce any new functionality or risk of regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch addresses a bug in the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function in the arch/x86/kernel/uprobes.c file.
2. Currently, the patch states that the only ->pre_xol() hook cannot fail, but it still needs to fix the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function.
3. The patch introduces a check for the ->pre_xol() hook and returns the error if it fails, allowing for a proper restart.
4. The patch then sets the instruction pointer (ip) to the xol_vaddr value in the uprobe_task structure.
5. It also saves the current trap number and sets it to UPROBE_TRAP_NR.
6. Additionally, it checks if the TIF_BLOCKSTEP flag is set and clears it if necessary.
7. Finally, the patch removes the redundant check for ->pre_xol() and returns 0 if it is not present.

Overall, the patch seems to address a potential issue and improves the functionality of the arch_uprobe_pre_xol() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Ack-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

3. The code changes in the patch modify the `ci_dpm_powergate_uvd` function in the `ci_dpm.c` file. The changes introduce conditional powergating for the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) block based on the `gate` parameter.

4. When `gate` is true, the UVD block is stopped and powergated using the `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` function. Then, the `ci_update_uvd_dpm` function is called with `gate` as the argument.

5. When `gate` is false, the UVD block is un-gated using the `amdgpu_set_powergating_state` function. Again, the `ci_update_uvd_dpm` function is called with `gate` as the argument.

6. The changes made in the patch appear to be focused on improving the power management behavior of the UVD block in the AMDGPU driver.

Based on this analysis, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to powergating the UVD block and improves the overall functionality of the AMDGPU driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple renaming of a function in the rtl8192e driver. The function `rtl8192_phyConfigBB` is being renamed to `_rtl92e_phy_config_bb`.

Considering that this patch does not have any functional impact and is only a renaming, it can be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the function `add_pcie_port()` to `dra7xx_add_pcie_port()`. This renaming is done to avoid collision in the global namespace, as the function is dra7xx-specific. Renaming functions to avoid collisions is a good practice.

2. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` tags from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The patch also includes an `Acked-by` tag from Kishon Vijay Abraham I, who is a maintainer of the `drivers/pci/host/pci-dra7xx.c` file. This indicates that the change has been reviewed and approved by a relevant maintainer.

4. The patch modifies the `dra7xx_pcie_probe()` function to use the renamed function `dra7xx_add_pcie_port()` instead of the original `add_pcie_port()`. This ensures that the updated function is used consistently throughout the codebase.

Overall, the patch appears to be a simple and necessary change to avoid naming collisions and maintain consistency. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new function `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` to the `ni_dpm.c` file in the `drm/radeon/dpm` directory. This function allows forcing a performance level via sysfs.

2. The function takes two parameters: `rdev` (a pointer to the `radeon_device` structure) and `level` (an enum representing the desired forced performance level).

3. The function first retrieves the current power state and performance level of the device.

4. Depending on the `level` parameter, the function sends specific messages to the SMC (System Management Controller) to set the forced and enabled performance levels accordingly.

5. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_HIGH`, the function sets the enabled levels to 0 and the forced levels to 1.

6. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_LOW`, the function sets the forced levels to 0 and the enabled levels to the maximum performance level count minus 1.

7. If the `level` is `RADEON_DPM_FORCED_LEVEL_AUTO`, the function sets both the forced and enabled levels to 0.

8. After setting the levels, the function updates the `forced_level` field in the `radeon_device` structure.

9. The function returns 0 on success and -EINVAL on failure.

10. The patch also adds a declaration of the `ni_dpm_force_performance_level` function in the `radeon_asic.h` file and assigns it to the `force_performance_level` field of the `cayman_asic` structure in the `radeon_asic.c` file.

11. The patch does not introduce any new issues or potential regressions.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid addition to the Linux kernel codebase, providing a new functionality for forcing performance levels. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch adds a new field "flags" to the structures "ceph_osd_req_op" and "ceph_osd_op" in the files "osd_client.h" and "rados.h" respectively. This field is used to encode the op flags for the Ceph OSD (Object Storage Daemon) operations.

2. The patch also includes the necessary changes in the "osd_client.c" file to encode the "flags" field when constructing the OSD request.

3. The changes are properly reviewed and signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating that the patch has undergone a review process.

6. In the tx28_stk5v3_init function, the patch calls mx28_add_mxs_mmc to add the mmc0 device.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It adds support for the mmc-device on the mach-tx28 platform and includes necessary configuration data for the mmc0 device.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a section mismatch warning triggered by the pnx8550-jbs_defconfig and pnx8550-stb810_defconfig configurations. Section mismatches can lead to runtime issues and should be resolved.

2. The warning message indicates that the function `prom_getcmdline()` references the variable `arcs_cmdline`, which is defined in the `.init.data` section. However, `prom_getcmdline()` itself lacks the `__initdata` annotation or has an incorrect annotation for `arcs_cmdline`.

3. The patch adds the `__init` annotation to the `prom_getcmdline()` function, indicating that it is only used during the initialization phase. This ensures that the function and the referenced variable are placed in the correct sections, resolving the section mismatch warning.

4. The patch is signed-off by Ralf Baechle, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the section mismatch warning and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for properly handling errors in the hv_acpi_init() function in the staging/hv/vmbus_drv.c file. The patch adds error handling code to unregister the vmbus_acpi_driver if vmbus_bus_init() fails.

Considering the information provided, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential error handling issue and ensures proper cleanup in case of failure during initialization.

The change is a simple code refactoring that improves code readability and maintainability. It does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug. Therefore, it is considered a safe change that can be included in stable releases.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Geliang Tang, Seth Jennings, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds. This indicates that the change has undergone a thorough review process and has received approval from the relevant stakeholders.

Overall, the patch is a minor improvement that does not introduce any risks or regressions. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a valid addition to the Linux kernel. The patch adds a vifs list to keep track of all the virtual interfaces associated with the hardware. This list will be used later for iterating through the vifs.

The patch includes changes in the `main.c` file of the `wl12xx` driver, where it initializes and adds the `wlvif` structure to the `wlvif_list` list. It also removes the `wlvif` structure from the list when removing an interface. Additionally, the patch modifies the `wl1271_alloc_hw` function in `wl12xx.h` to initialize the `wlvif_list` list.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable addition to the codebase, as it introduces a necessary data structure and updates the relevant functions accordingly. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of the "sddiv_mask" parameter to the USB DPLL in the OMAP4 clock data. This parameter is used to control the sddiv (spread spectrum divider) for the USB DPLL.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It deactivates an interface immediately on enumeration failure. This indicates that the patch is intended to fix a problem related to interface activation.

2. The patch includes error handling: If the activation or enabling of the interface fails, the patch handles the error by deactivating the interface and adding it to the interface list.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers: It has been reviewed and approved by Johan Hovold and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or major changes: It focuses on fixing a specific issue related to interface activation, which reduces the risk of introducing new bugs or regressions.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the issue with interface activation.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an inconsistency in the mask defines for certain registers in the WM8900 codec driver.
2. The patch removes the bitwise NOT operation on the mask bits for WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_BCLK_MASK and WM8900_REG_CLOCKING1_OPCLK_MASK, making the defines correspond to the bit defines in the datasheet.
3. The patch also removes the bitwise NOT operation on the mask bits for WM8900_LRC_MASK, aligning it with the correct bit defines.
4. The changes ensure consistent and correct usage of the mask defines, reducing the potential for errors.

Overall, the patch improves the clarity and correctness of the code, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `ti_abb_init_table` function in the `ti-abb-regulator.c` file. The change is to propagate the error value returned by the `of_property_count_u32_elems` function instead of hardcoding `-ENODEV` as the return value.

By returning the actual error value, the patch ensures that the caller of `ti_abb_init_table` receives accurate information about the failure. This can be helpful for debugging and error handling purposes.

Overall, the patch seems to improve the error reporting mechanism in the `ti_abb_init_table` function, making it more robust and reliable. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the patch suggests removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function of the `ux500_pcm.c` file in the ASoC subsystem. The reason given is that the driver never uses `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, so there is no need to set the data using `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Patch rationale: The patch provides a clear rationale for the change, stating that the driver does not use `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, making the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` unnecessary.

2. Sign-offs: The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Lars-Peter Clausen and Ola Lilja, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

3. Impact analysis: It is important to assess the potential impact of the patch. Removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` may have implications on the functionality or performance of the driver. It is necessary to review the code and understand the purpose of this function call and its potential consequences.

Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. However, a thorough code review and testing should be conducted to ensure that the removal of `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` does not introduce any unintended side effects.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the spin lock in the ramoops driver. Currently, the spin_lock_init() function is called before the kmalloc() function, which allocates memory for cxt->pstore.buf. If the memory allocation fails, there is no need to initialize the spin lock.

The patch moves the spin_lock_init() function call after the error checking for the memory allocation. This ensures that the spin lock is only initialized if the memory allocation is successful.

By making this change, the patch improves the code's efficiency and correctness by avoiding unnecessary spin lock initialization when memory allocation fails.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the log messages in the exynos_cpufreq_scale function to use the dev_err/info functions instead of pr_err/info. This change ensures that accurate log messages with the device name are displayed. Using dev_err/info is preferred when dealing with device-specific information.

2. The patch adds a new member, "dev," to the exynos_dvfs_info structure. This member is used to store a reference to the device associated with the exynos_info structure. This reference is later used in the dev_err calls to provide the device-specific log messages.

3. The patch updates the error handling in the exynos_cpufreq_scale function to use dev_err instead of pr_err. This change ensures that the error messages include the device name, providing more context for debugging.

4. The patch also updates the error handling in the exynos_cpufreq_probe function to use dev_err instead of pr_err. This change ensures that the error messages include the device name, providing more context for debugging.

Overall, the patch improves the accuracy and context of the log messages by using dev_err/info functions instead of pr_err/info. It also adds the necessary device reference to the exynos_dvfs_info structure for device-specific log messages. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the sound/soc/sh/rcar/ssi.c file. It replaces the usage of clk_get() function with devm_clk_get() function in two places.

In the first change, the patch replaces "clk = clk_get(dev, name);" with "clk = devm_clk_get(dev, name);". This change suggests that the devm_clk_get() function should be used instead of clk_get() to retrieve the clock for the device. The devm_clk_get() function is a managed version of clk_get() that automatically handles resource management, making it more convenient and less error-prone.

In the second change, the patch removes the "clk_put(ssi->clk);" line. This indicates that the clk_put() function is no longer needed because the devm_clk_get() function takes care of resource management.

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the recommended devm_clk_get() function and removing unnecessary clk_put() calls. These changes enhance resource management and reduce the risk of resource leaks.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This indicates that these functions are not used outside of this file, which improves code organization and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.

2. The patch also addresses the warning messages related to missing prototypes for the `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` functions. By marking these functions as static, the warning messages are eliminated, improving code quality.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the respective contributors.

Overall, the patch is a simple and straightforward improvement that enhances code organization and resolves warning messages. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the beginning of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the subsequent ring count validations are only performed when the interrupt mode is MSI-X. This is a valid optimization as there is no need to validate ring counts if they are not going to change.

2. If the interrupt mode is not MSI-X, the function returns with an error, indicating that there is no RSS/TSS support in non-MSI-X mode. This is a reasonable check to ensure that the function is not called in an unsupported mode.

3. The patch modifies the validation of the RX and TX ring counts. Instead of validating the ring counts unconditionally, it now checks if the ring counts have actually changed before performing the validation. This optimization avoids unnecessary validation calls when the ring counts remain the same.

4. The `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function in `qlcnic_main.c` is no longer used and has been removed. This function previously performed checks for RSS/TSS support in different interrupt modes, but those checks are now handled in `qlcnic_set_channels()`.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of ring count validations and adds a necessary check for the interrupt mode. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward cleanup patch that removes unnecessary OOM (Out of Memory) messages in the rtc-nuc900 driver. The patch removes the duplicated OOM message and simplifies the code by removing the unnecessary error handling.

Considering that this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be categorized as a cleanup or optimization patch. Such patches are generally accepted in stable releases to improve code quality and maintainability.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the bcm_sf2 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch fixes an issue where the driver was using a stale copy of the port_vlan_ctl bitmask value instead of the updated value maintained by b53_device.

Given that this patch is a bug fix, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and improves the functionality of the bcm_sf2 driver.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

1. Line 1900: The patch changes the label from `nomem3` to `nomem4` in the `if` condition.
2. Line 1910: The patch changes the label from `nomem3` to `nomem4` in the `default` case of a `switch` statement.
3. Line 1919: The patch adds a new line to free the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt` in the `nomem4` label.

Based on the analysis of the patch, it appears that the patch fixes a potential memory leak by properly freeing the memory allocated for `docg3->bbt` in the error path. Therefore, this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is fixing a lack of spin_lock protection in the s5p-jpeg driver. The patch adds spin_lock_irqsave and spin_unlock_irqrestore calls to protect critical sections of code that modify device registers. 

Considering the importance of protecting device registers from concurrent access, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple coding style change. The patch replaces the usage of `x != NULL` with `x` in the `ms_free_l2p_tbl` function in the `ms.c` file of the `rts5208` driver in the staging directory.

This change is suggested by the `checkpatch` tool, which is used to enforce coding style guidelines in the Linux kernel. The purpose of this change is to improve code readability and maintainability.

Since this patch does not introduce any functional changes or fix any bugs, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are fixing a specific issue or improving code quality significantly.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes the module autoload for the OF platform driver in the EDAC subsystem for the ppc4xx_edac driver. It adds the missing OF module alias information, which enables module autoloading to work correctly. 

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Luis de Bethencourt and Johannes Thumshirn. It also includes the necessary changes to the ppc4xx_edac.c file.

Additionally, the patch includes a link to the original discussion on the Linux kernel mailing list for further reference.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and has undergone review, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the be2iscsi driver in the drivers/scsi/be2iscsi/be_main.c file. It includes changes related to the initialization of the Scatter-Gather List (SGL) and the posting of pages for the chute.

The first change in the patch is in the beiscsi_post_pages() function. It adds a loop to iterate over the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers and checks if each ULP is supported by the firmware configuration. If a supported ULP is found, the loop breaks. This change seems to be a valid addition to handle multiple ULPs.

The second change is in the beiscsi_init_sgl_handle() function. It adds a similar loop to iterate over the ULP numbers and find the ULP's ICD (Initial Command Descriptor) start value. This value is then used to calculate the page offset for SGL initialization. Again, this change seems to be a valid addition to handle multiple ULPs.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch introduces necessary changes to handle multiple ULPs in the be2iscsi driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the jack connection decision logic for the nau8825 codec in the ASoC subsystem.

2. The patch introduces additional conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic.

3. The existing code only handles active low jack insertion logic, and the patch enhances it to handle both cases.

4. The patch adds a new variable, "active_high," which is determined based on the value of the NAU8825_JACK_POLARITY bit in the NAU8825_REG_JACK_DET_CTRL register.

5. The existing code checks the status of the NAU8825_GPIO2JD1 bit in the NAU8825_REG_I2C_DEVICE_ID register to determine the jack connection status.

6. The patch modifies the return statement to compare the "active_high" variable with the "is_high" variable, ensuring that the jack connection status is returned correctly based on the jack insertion logic.

7. The patch does not introduce any new issues or potential regressions.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the existing code and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward modification to the mc13892_sw_regulator_ops structure in the mc13892-regulator.c file. The patch adds the map_voltage field and assigns it the regulator_map_voltage_ascend function.

Considering the purpose of the patch, which is to use regulator_map_voltage_ascend for both mc13892_sw1 and mc13892_sw voltage tables, it seems reasonable and beneficial. The regulator_map_voltage_ascend function is likely designed to handle voltage mapping in an ascending order, which aligns with the voltage tables mentioned in the patch.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch adds a new flag, `allow_runtime_pm`, to the `struct sdhci_pci_fixes` and `struct sdhci_pci_chip` data structures. This flag is used to indicate whether runtime power management (PM) is supported by the device.

In the `sdhci_intel_mfd_sd`, `sdhci_intel_mfd_sdio`, and `sdhci_intel_mfd_emmc` structures, the `allow_runtime_pm` flag is set to `true`, indicating that these devices support runtime PM.

In the `sdhci_pci_probe` function, the `allow_runtime_pm` flag is checked before calling `sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow`, ensuring that runtime PM is only allowed if the flag is set to `true`.

Similarly, in the `sdhci_pci_remove` function, the `allow_runtime_pm` flag is checked before calling `sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid`, ensuring that runtime PM is only forbidden if the flag is set to `true`.

Overall, this patch adds support for runtime PM for devices that specifically indicate their support for it. Since it introduces a new feature without any apparent issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for handling the irq interrupt for the second BSD ring in the i915 driver. The patch adds support for the second VCS (Video Command Streamer) interrupt, allowing the driver to handle interrupts from both VCS1 and VCS2 rings.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary update to improve the accuracy and clarity of the "micd-timeout" property in the extcon-arizona driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to delay the initial jack detection by the debounce time to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce. 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Purpose: The patch aims to improve the initialization process by delaying the initial jack detection. This can be beneficial for ensuring accurate jack detection and preventing false positives or negatives.

2. Code logic: The patch uses the `schedule_delayed_work` function to schedule the jack detection after a certain debounce time. This approach seems reasonable and does not introduce any obvious issues.

3. Impact: It is important to assess the potential impact of the patch on the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel. In this case, delaying the initial jack detection may improve stability and prevent erroneous detection, but it is crucial to ensure that it does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues with existing hardware.

Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, a more thorough analysis, including testing and verification, is necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch fixes the definition of pgprot_writecombine() for MIPS architecture. It addresses an issue where the generic code tries to provide a default implementation by defining pgprot_writecombine as pgprot_noncached, but the MIPS implementation is an inline function rather than a #define. As a result, the MIPS implementation was never used due to the conflicting #define in the generic code.

To resolve this, the patch adds a #define pgprot_writecombine pgprot_writecombine to prevent the generic code from redefining it. This ensures that the MIPS implementation of pgprot_writecombine is used correctly.

The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors and has a Patchwork link for further reference. Therefore, it can be considered suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch hardcodes the clock event rating for the CMT (Clock Measurement Timer) driver to 125. This change ensures that all boards using the CMT will have a consistent clock event rating. 

The clock event rating is an indication of the timer's accuracy and reliability. A higher rating indicates a more accurate and reliable timer. In this case, a rating of 125 is being set, which is a commonly used value for the CMT.

The patch modifies the `sh_cmt_register_clockevent` function to set the clock event rating to 125. This ensures that the clock event device associated with the CMT will have the desired rating.

The `sh_cmt_register` function is also modified to pass a boolean flag (`clockevent`) instead of the clock event rating. If the flag is true, the `sh_cmt_register_clockevent` function is called with the name and the clock event rating of 125.

Overall, this patch ensures that the CMT driver consistently uses a clock event rating of 125, which is the desired behavior for all boards. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to clarify the variable names in the perf_evlist__strerror_mmap function. It prepares the patch for further checks when the number of pages being attempted is below /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb, but the operation fails due to the user not having CAP_IPC_LOCK.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:
- The variable "value" is renamed to "pages_max_per_user" to better reflect its purpose.
- The variable "pages_attempted" is introduced to store the number of pages attempted, calculated as evlist->mmap_len divided by 1024.

The patch then updates the error message to include the correct values for the hints. It uses the renamed variable "pages_max_per_user" and the newly introduced "pages_attempted" variable.

Overall, the patch improves the clarity of the code and provides more accurate information in the error message. It does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the code.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch is titled "drivers/net: enic: release rtnl_lock on error-path" and is signed-off by Konstantin Khlebnikov and David S. Miller. It modifies the `enic_change_mtu_work()` function in the `enic_main.c` file.

The patch adds two `rtnl_unlock()` calls on error paths in the `enic_change_mtu_work()` function. These calls release the rtnl_lock, which is a lock that protects network device configuration changes. Releasing the lock is necessary to avoid potential deadlocks and ensure proper synchronization.

The first `rtnl_unlock()` call is added after the `vnic_rq_disable()` function call, which disables the receive queue (RQ). If the `vnic_rq_disable()` function returns an error, the lock is released, and an error message is logged before returning.

The second `rtnl_unlock()` call is added after the check for allocated receive buffers. If no buffers are allocated, the lock is released, and an error message is logged before returning.

By adding these `rtnl_unlock()` calls, the patch ensures that the rtnl_lock is always released before returning on error paths, preventing potential lock-related issues.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug: Currently, the functions v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() are only called when the last user closes the device and the device is already disconnected. However, the patch suggests calling these functions whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users. This ensures that the necessary cleanup and memory deallocation are performed correctly.

2. The patch includes proper sign-offs: It is important to note that the patch includes sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

3. The patch improves error handling: The patch modifies the warning message in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function to clarify that memory deallocation is deferred until the last close, rather than deregistration. This improves the clarity of the warning message.

4. The patch removes unnecessary function calls: The patch removes the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() in the em28xx_v4l2_close() function. Since these functions are already called in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function, it is unnecessary to call them again in the close function.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug, improves error handling, and removes unnecessary function calls. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for fast-xmit in the ath9k driver. Here is my analysis:

Considering that removing unused code improves code readability and maintainability, this patch seems reasonable. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the "spi_master->transfer_one" function returns a positive value, which is not considered an error. However, if the return value is positive, the code currently hits an error when the "transfer_one" callback returns 1.

The proposed fix sets the return value "ret" to 0 when "transfer_one" returns a positive value. This ensures that the code does not treat the positive return value as an error and avoids the "spi_master spi0: failed to transfer one message from queue" error.

The change is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. It simply handles the positive return value correctly and waits for the completion of the transfer.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `__auxtrace_mmap__read` function in `tools/perf/util/auxtrace.c` and adds a new field `alignment` to the `struct auxtrace_record` in `tools/perf/util/auxtrace.h`.

The purpose of this patch is to allow auxtrace data to be a multiple of something other than the page size. This is necessary for certain cases, such as BTS (Branch Trace Store), where the buffer contains 24-byte records.

The patch checks if `itr->alignment` is set and adjusts the length and size of the data accordingly. It subtracts the unwanted bytes from `len1` and `size` to ensure the data is aligned properly.

By allowing auxtrace data alignment to be configurable, this patch improves the flexibility and compatibility of the perf tools. It addresses a specific use case and ensures that the buffer is correctly aligned for BTS.

Given that this patch introduces a useful enhancement without any apparent negative side effects, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

Upon analyzing the patch, I have the following observations:

1. The patch moves the release handle for the `amdgpu_bo_create` function into the `failed` label. This ensures that the handle is properly released in case of an error during buffer creation.

2. The release handles for `amdgpu_bo_reserve`, `amdgpu_bo_pin`, and `amdgpu_bo_kmap` functions are also moved into their respective fail labels. This ensures proper cleanup in case of errors during buffer reservation, pinning, or mapping.

3. The `return 0` statement is added after the loop that processes the firmware headers. This indicates that the function should return success if the loop completes successfully.

4. The `adev->firmware.smu_load` flag is set to false in the `failed` label. This indicates that the firmware loading has failed.

Based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The changes made in the patch improve code readability and ensure proper cleanup in case of errors during buffer creation, reservation, pinning, and mapping. Additionally, the regression fix by Christian König is included, which further strengthens the case for accepting the patch.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the function `hfi1_query_qp` is being removed from the `qp.c` file in the `staging/rdma/hfi1` directory. The function is currently defined in `qp.c`, `qp.h`, and `verbs.c` files.

The patch suggests relying on the `rvt_query_qp` function defined in `rdmavt` instead of the `hfi1_query_qp` function. This change is reviewed and signed-off by Dennis Dalessandro, Harish Chegondi, and Doug Ledford.

Considering the removal of the `hfi1_query_qp` function and the reliance on `rvt_query_qp`, it seems that this patch is a cleanup and consolidation effort. However, without further context or information about the specific reasons for this change, it is difficult to determine the impact on stability.

Therefore, I would recommend further analysis and testing to ensure that the removal of `hfi1_query_qp` and the reliance on `rvt_query_qp` do not introduce any regressions or issues. If the patch passes thorough testing and does not introduce any negative effects, it can be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. However, without additional information, I cannot definitively determine whether to accept or reject this patch.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it has been reset. The problem occurs during kernel reboot when the buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler, but the buffer itself is reset before the interrupt is called.

To fix this issue, the patch modifies the code to check if the buffer is empty before updating the buffer tail. If the buffer is not empty, the tail is updated as before. Additionally, the patch includes a check to wake up the UART write if the number of pending characters in the buffer is less than a defined threshold.

The changes made in the patch seem reasonable and targeted towards resolving the specific issue described. The patch has also been signed-off by the relevant contributors, including Sonic Zhang and Greg Kroah-Hartman.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch adds support for the Enhanced Periodic Interrupt Timer (EPIT) to the clock subsystem in the ARM i.MX5x platform. It introduces four new clock gates: epit1_ipg_gate, epit1_hf_gate, epit2_ipg_gate, and epit2_hf_gate.

The changes made in the patch seem to be specific to the i.MX5x platform and do not affect other architectures. The patch adds clock gates for the EPIT, which is a hardware timer used for generating periodic interrupts. The EPIT is commonly used in embedded systems for various timing-related tasks.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it adds necessary clock support for a specific hardware component, it appears to be a valid and useful addition. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a bug in the Bluetooth module's update_scan_rsp_data() function. The function is supposed to operate on the scan_rsp_data_len and scan_rsp_data variables, but it mistakenly operates on the adv_data_len and adv_data variables instead.

The patch corrects this by updating the correct variables: hdev->scan_rsp_data_len and hdev->scan_rsp_data. It also updates the comparison condition to check if hdev->scan_rsp_data_len is equal to len and if the memory contents of cp.data and hdev->scan_rsp_data are the same.

The patch then copies the contents of cp.data to hdev->scan_rsp_data and updates hdev->scan_rsp_data_len with the correct length.

Overall, the patch addresses the issue and ensures that the correct variables are used for updating and comparing scan response data. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The change from `pr_warn` to `netdev_warn` is a more consistent and appropriate approach for logging warnings related to network devices.

3. The patch maintains one occurrence of `pr_warn` as it is unrelated to the `net_device` and does not need to be converted.

4. The patch includes proper attribution with the Signed-off-by tags.

Overall, the patch improves the consistency and accuracy of warning messages in the `bond_debugfs.c` file. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is constifying the "exynos_drm_crtc_ops" structures in the "exynos5433_drm_decon.c" file. The purpose of this change is to declare these structures as const since they are only passed as an argument to the function "exynos_drm_crtc_create", which expects a const struct pointer.

The patch modifies the "decon_crtc_ops" structure declaration by adding the "const" qualifier. This change ensures that the structure is treated as read-only and cannot be modified within the function.

Considering the nature of the change and the fact that it improves code correctness by enforcing const correctness, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a precedence issue in setting the `mask_pos` variable in the `msi_capability_init` function of the `msi.c` file in the PCI driver. The original code incorrectly assigns `PCI_MSI_MASK_64` to `mask_pos` when the `control` variable has the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag set.

The patch fixes this issue by using proper parentheses to ensure the correct precedence of the `+` and `?:` operators. It explicitly checks the `PCI_MSI_FLAGS_64BIT` flag and assigns the appropriate value to `mask_pos` accordingly.

The change proposed in the patch is a straightforward fix that correctly sets the `mask_pos` variable based on the `control` flag. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch updates the tg3 version from 3.120 to 3.121. It also updates the DRV_MODULE_RELDATE from "August 18, 2011" to "November 2, 2011". 

Since this patch only updates the version number and release date, without any additional changes or fixes, it is likely a routine update rather than a critical bug fix. Therefore, it is not necessary to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. 

So, the answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple code modification that replaces the use of `platform_driver_register()` with `builtin_platform_driver()`. This change aims to simplify the code.

Considering the nature of the change and the absence of any potential issues or regressions, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch updates the code in the drm/msm driver, specifically in the msm_atomic_commit() function.

2. The patch introduces the use of drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() function to set the fence for the plane_state.

3. The comment in the patch mentions that drm_atomic_set_fence_for_plane() is smart and won't overwrite plane_state->fence if the user has already set an explicit fence there. This indicates that the patch is intended to improve the handling of fences in the driver.

4. The patch includes the necessary Cc, Signed-off-by, Reviewed-by, and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by relevant individuals.

5. The patch also includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website for further reference.

6. The code changes in the patch appear to be correct and do not introduce any obvious issues or regressions.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that the patch is a valid improvement to the drm/msm driver and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to convert the usage of the `should_stop` variable into the `kthread_should_stop()` API in the `virthba.c` file of the Unisys driver. 

The `kthread_should_stop()` API is used to check if a kernel thread should stop execution. It returns true if the thread should stop, indicating that it should break out of the loop and exit.

In the given patch, the usage of `kthread_should_stop()` has been added inside the loop, and the previous usage of `dc->threadinfo.should_stop` has been removed.

Considering this, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). By using the `kthread_should_stop()` API, the code adheres to the recommended practice for checking if a kernel thread should stop, which improves code readability and maintainability.

However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the entire Unisys driver and its interactions with the rest of the kernel codebase is necessary to ensure that this patch does not introduce any unintended side effects or conflicts.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to create clock aliases purely from DT (Device Tree) data for OMAP2+ ARM devices. This approach eliminates the need to add most clock aliases under drivers/clk/ti/clk-xyz.c files.

The changes in the patch involve modifying the _add_clkdev() function in omap_device.c. The patch first attempts to get the clock using clk_get_sys() and checks if it fails and if the DT has been populated. If so, it retrieves the clock using of_clk_get_from_provider() and registers the clock alias using clk_register_clkdev(). If the clock retrieval fails or the DT is not populated, it falls back to the original behavior of using clk_add_alias().

The patch appears to be a reasonable improvement as it leverages DT data to create clock aliases, reducing the need for manual additions in the clk-xyz.c files. It also handles the case where the clock retrieval fails and the DT is populated.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis of the patch:

1. The patch fixes a return value issue in the efivarfs_file_write() function in the efivars.c file.

2. The issue is related to stuffing a variable of type size_t (unsigned) into a ssize_t (signed), which can introduce sign issues.

3. The patch replaces the variable "count" with "bytes" of type ssize_t to correctly handle the return value.

4. The patch also updates the error handling code to assign the appropriate error value to "bytes" in case of failures.

5. The patch ensures that the return value "bytes" is correctly set before returning from the function.

Overall, the patch addresses the sign issue and improves the correctness of the return value. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any other factors that may affect the decision-making process.

2. The patch removes the unnecessary return statement `return 0;` from the `drm_pci_agp_init` function since the function now has a void return type.

3. In the `drm_dev_register` function, the patch removes the check for the return value of `dev->driver->bus->agp_init` and directly calls the function `dev->driver->bus->agp_init(dev)`.

4. The `agp_init` function pointer in the `struct drm_bus` is also updated to have a void return type.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary complexity and redundant return statements. It does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of existing code.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the netfilter bridge code in the Linux kernel. It introduces a new function `nf_bridge_info_free` that frees the `nf_bridge` information from the `sk_buff` structure. This information is only needed for the `-m physdev` option, so it can be safely freed after the `POST_ROUTING` stage.

The patch also adds calls to `nf_bridge_info_free` in two places: `br_nf_push_frag_xmit` and `br_nf_dev_queue_xmit`. These calls ensure that the `nf_bridge` information is freed before the packets are transmitted.

The patch improves memory management by freeing the `nf_bridge` information when it is no longer needed, reducing the chances of memory leaks. It also ensures that the allocation and freeing of the `nf_bridge` information typically happen on the same CPU, which can improve performance.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable and beneficial change to the netfilter bridge code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch increases the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw_abort_tx_dma() function.

2. It introduces a new variable "maxdelay" and initializes it to 1000.

3. If the current channel is a half-rate channel, "maxdelay" is multiplied by 2. If it is a quarter-rate channel, "maxdelay" is multiplied by 4.

4. The patch then uses "maxdelay" as the upper limit for the loop that waits for the tx abort to complete.

5. The loop waits for "maxdelay" iterations, with a 5 microsecond delay between each iteration.

6. Overall, this patch adjusts the tx abort timeout based on the channel rate, allowing for longer timeouts for slower channels.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable adjustment to improve the stability of the ath9k driver for half/quarter rate channels. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2) The second bug is related to waking up the txqueue when no slot was freed. The patch addresses this by checking the number of used tx buffers and only waking up the queue if it is below a certain threshold (ENET_TX_DESC/2). This prevents unnecessary wake-ups when there are still available slots.

3) The patch includes proper attribution with Signed-off-by tags from the author and the reported/tested-by tags from the individuals who reported and tested the patch.

4) The patch also includes a Cc tag to notify Kevin Wells about the patch.

Overall, the patch addresses specific bugs and improves the behavior of the __lpc_handle_xmit() function. It has been reviewed and tested, and the changes appear to be correct and necessary. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where kprobes fail to find symbols even if they exist in the map (dso). Currently, the code relies on `map__load()` to find symbols, but for kprobes, it returns with no result. To fix this, the patch suggests using `map__find_symbol_by_name()` instead, which loads a map with full symbols and sorts them by name.

The patch introduces a new function `find_probe_functions()` that uses `map__find_symbol_by_name()` to search for symbols in the map. It iterates through the symbols with the same name and checks if they have a global or local binding. The function returns the number of matched functions.

In the `find_probe_trace_events_from_map()` function, the patch replaces the previous method of loading symbols with `map__load()` and filtering with `probe_function_filter()`. Instead, it calls `find_probe_functions()` to get the number of matched functions. If no functions are found, an error message is printed, and the function returns -ENOENT.

The patch then uses `map__find_symbol_by_name()` to iterate through the symbols with the same name and populate the `tevs` array with the probe trace events.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of finding symbols for kprobes and ensures that they are correctly identified and added to the probe trace events. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the md (multiple devices) driver. The issue arises when setting the 'action' to 'idle' while checking the sync_thread without holding the mddev_lock(). This can lead to a race condition where md_check_recovery could reap the thread itself and start another thread, causing confusion.

The patch proposes a solution by introducing a check for MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING before acquiring the mddev_lock(). If MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set, the patch flushes the workqueue, checks if mddev->sync_thread is set, and then reaps the sync thread under the mddev_lock().

The patch also includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit, and a Signed-off-by tag from the author.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it appears to be a valid fix for the race condition. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the "blocked" flag, which is considered redundant and can lead to a race condition. Closing the TX queue and setting the "blocked" flag between these two operations can cause the completion function to check the "blocked" flag and incorrectly determine that the queue is not blocked.

2. Instead of relying on the "blocked" flag, the patch suggests using the netif_tx_queue_stopped function to check the state of the queue. This avoids the race condition mentioned above.

3. The patch modifies the mlx4_en_process_tx_cq function to wake up the TX queue if it was stopped and at least one packet was completed. This ensures that the queue is properly resumed when necessary.

4. The patch also removes the setting of the "blocked" flag in the mlx4_en_xmit function, as it is no longer needed.

Overall, the patch addresses a race condition and improves the handling of the TX queue stop/wake flow. It seems to be a valid and beneficial change, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses a specific hardware issue and ensures proper functionality for the affected board. Additionally, it has been signed-off by relevant contributors and includes the necessary Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list for consideration in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend a (B) NAK, meaning that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Here's my analysis:

The patch aims to allow multiple stacks in applications without truncating callchains. It disables the check for the frame pointer (fp) being less than the stack pointer (RSP). The reasoning behind this is that other checks in the code will handle any potential issues.

However, the patch lacks sufficient justification for disabling the (fp < RSP) check. It mentions that GDB shows proper stack traces and frame pointer chaining is intact, but it doesn't provide any concrete evidence or explanation for why this change is safe and necessary.

Additionally, the patch mentions the possibility of having userspace advise the kernel on valid stack addresses in the long term. This suggests that there might be a better solution than simply disabling the check.

Without more thorough testing and a clear explanation of the potential risks and benefits, it is difficult to determine the impact of this patch. Therefore, it is safer to reject it for inclusion in stable releases until further investigation and validation are conducted.

1. The patch fixes a warning in the of_free_opp_table() function related to not having OPP (Operating Performance Points) defined for a device. The patch suggests that not having OPP defined for a device should not trigger a warning.

2. The patch also handles the case where find_device_opp() returns an error pointer (-EINVAL). Instead of crashing in dev_name(), the patch checks if the error is -ENODEV and returns without triggering a warning. If the error is not -ENODEV, it prints a warning message indicating an invalid device.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags from relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch addresses the warning and handles the error case appropriately. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch removes a change that appears to have been added accidentally, which caused the regression.

3. The patch is signed-off by Jan Beulich and David Vrabel, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch includes appropriate Cc's to relevant individuals and mailing lists, ensuring that the patch is properly communicated and tracked.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases to address the regression and ensure proper transaction handling in xenbus_dev_request_and_reply().

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a new software pte flag, L_PTE_NONE, which is set to identify faulting, present entries. This flag helps to differentiate PROT_NONE mappings from other types of mappings.

2. The patch modifies the existing definitions of L_PTE_NONE in the ARM architecture-specific header files (arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable-2level.h and arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable-3level.h) to include the new flag.

3. The patch also updates the definitions of PAGE_NONE and __PAGE_NONE in arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable.h to include the L_PTE_NONE flag.

4. In the assembly code files (arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S, arch/arm/mm/proc-v7-2level.S, and arch/arm/mm/proc-v7-3level.S), the patch adds checks for the L_PTE_NONE flag when modifying or setting page table entries. These checks ensure that the L_PTE_NONE flag is properly handled in the page table manipulation code.

Overall, this patch addresses a vulnerability where PROT_NONE pages can be read by the kernel on systems without support for domains. By introducing the L_PTE_NONE flag and updating the relevant code, the patch ensures that faulting, present entries for PROT_NONE mappings are correctly identified and handled.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch and the explanation, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug in the time interval calculation in the ratelimit code. The current implementation sets the `begin` value to 0 when `rs->interval` is passed, which leads to improper suppression and incorrect behavior.

The proposed fix suggests setting `begin` to `jiffies` instead of 0 to properly reset the interval. This change ensures that the time interval check works correctly and `rs->printed` is initialized as expected.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue and improves the functionality of the ratelimit code.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the UDP error handling code in both net/ipv4/udp.c and net/ipv6/udp.c files.
2. In net/ipv4/udp.c, the patch changes the behavior when an ICMP redirect is received. Instead of breaking out of the error handler, it now uses a "goto out" statement. This ensures that the error handler does not touch the socket, as redirects are not considered error conditions.
3. In net/ipv6/udp.c, a similar change is made for NDISC_REDIRECT type ICMPv6 packets. Again, the "goto out" statement is used to skip further processing of the socket.
4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any specific bug. It simply improves the handling of ICMP redirects in the UDP layer.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe improvement to the UDP error handling code. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch addresses a regression in HDMI audio caused by code refactoring.

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The patch disables register synchronization for low-frequency WM8996 SYSCLK. It mentions that with a low-frequency SYSCLK and fast I2C clock register synchronization, there may be occasional delays causing I/O issues. Disabling synchronization is proposed to avoid these issues.

2. The patch is signed-off by Mark Brown, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

3. The patch modifies the `wm8996_set_sysclk` function in `sound/soc/codecs/wm8996.c` and adds a new variable `sync` to control the synchronization behavior. It sets `sync` to `WM8996_REG_SYNC` initially and then modifies it to `0` when the clock rate is 32000 or 32768.

4. The patch also updates the `WM8996_CONTROL_INTERFACE_1` register using `snd_soc_update_bits` to disable synchronization.

5. The patch includes changes to the `wm8996.h` header file, adding definitions related to `WM8996_REG_SYNC`.

Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a specific issue and has been signed-off by a recognized contributor. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the paging_init() function, where the detection of unsupported highmem with cache aliases was ineffective. The code was running before the caches were probed, resulting in incorrect evaluation of the cpu_has_dc_aliases macro. This led to coherency issues or triggering of a BUG_ON in flush_kernel_dcache_page().

The patch fixes this by running paging_init() later, after cpu_cache_init(), ensuring that cpu_has_dc_aliases is evaluated correctly and the unsupported highmem case is detected successfully.

Additionally, the patch addresses a hidden issue in mem_init_free_highmem(), where it attempted to free all highmem pages, even though they were not being used and lacked valid page structs. This caused an invalid pointer dereference and a TLB exception. The patch skips the loop in mem_init_free_highmem() if cpu_has_dc_aliases evaluates to true, avoiding the issue.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author and maintainers of the affected code.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes the duration calculation for non-aggregated packets in the ath9k wireless driver.

2. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem: When not aggregating packets, the length of the packet should be passed to calculate the duration. However, after a recent rework of the tx path, the length was set to 0 for a burst of single frames.

3. The patch proposes a solution: It overrides the length in the ath_tx_fill_desc function before passing it to ath_buf_set_rate, ensuring that the duration calculation is correct.

4. The patch includes relevant information: It mentions the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list for stable release consideration and provides the reported-by and signed-off-by tags.

5. The patch includes the necessary code changes: It modifies the ath_tx_fill_desc function to set the length to fi->framelen when not aggregating packets.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and includes the necessary changes and information. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to analyze the provided information.

The patch addresses a regression introduced by commit 2ae66c26550cd94b0e2606a9275eb0ab7070ad0e, which caused a buffer-alignment issue on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI. The problem arises because the driver modifies the global variable align_buffer_size when an Intel controller is found, but the Nvidia HDMI controller is probed after Intel, and Nvidia chips require aligned buffers.

The patch fixes the problem by moving the flag into the local struct, ensuring it is not affected by other controllers.

Based on this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a regression and resolves a specific issue related to buffer alignment on machines with Intel controller and Nvidia HDMI. Additionally, it includes a reference to the bug report in Bugzilla, which provides further context and validation for the patch.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a comparison issue in the `exact_match` function of `lib/dma-debug.c`. The patch fixes the comparison by changing `a->dev_addr == a->dev_addr` to `a->dev_addr == b->dev_addr`. 

Since the original code was comparing `a->dev_addr` with itself, it was always evaluating to true, which is incorrect. The patch corrects this mistake by comparing `a->dev_addr` with `b->dev_addr`, which is the intended behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a comparison issue and ensures the correct behavior of the `exact_match` function.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to initcall error handling in the ehv_bytechan driver. It aims to prevent the deregistration of a never-registered tty driver, which could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference.

2. The patch introduces changes to the error handling code in the ehv_bc_init() function.

3. Previously, if the allocation of the tty driver failed, the code would jump to the "error" label, which would unregister and free the driver. However, this behavior is incorrect because the driver was never registered in the first place.

4. The patch modifies the code to jump to the "err_free_bcs" label instead, which correctly frees the allocated resources (bcs) before returning the error code.

5. Additionally, if the registration of the tty driver or the platform driver fails, the patch now jumps to appropriate error handling labels ("err_put_tty_driver" and "err_deregister_tty_driver") to unregister and free the driver before returning the error code.

6. The patch ensures that all allocated resources are properly cleaned up in case of errors during initialization.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a potential issue and improves the error handling in the ehv_bytechan driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is a cleanup and does not change the functionality of the code. It suggests using the GFP flags from the caller instead of using GFP_ATOMIC, as there is no need to prefer GFP_ATOMIC in this case.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

This patch is related to the drm/i915 driver, specifically addressing an issue with misconfigured VBT (Video BIOS Table) on machines causing a regression. The patch adds a quirk to assert the presence of a controllable backlight and uses it to ignore the VBT backlight presence check during backlight setup.

The patch includes the following changes:

1. In the i915_drv.h header file, a new quirk flag QUIRK_BACKLIGHT_PRESENT is defined.
2. In the intel_display.c file, a new function quirk_backlight_present() is added. This function sets the QUIRK_BACKLIGHT_PRESENT flag in the dev_priv structure and prints an informational message.
3. In the intel_panel.c file, the intel_panel_setup_backlight() function is modified. If the VBT indicates no backlight is present, the function checks if the QUIRK_BACKLIGHT_PRESENT flag is set. If it is set, an informational message is printed. Otherwise, the function returns 0, indicating that native backlight control is not available.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a regression caused by a misconfigured VBT and provides a workaround by asserting the presence of a controllable backlight. The patch has been reviewed and tested, and it includes the necessary changes to handle the quirk and provide the desired behavior.

Please note that the patch is marked for inclusion in the stable branch for the 3.15 kernel version, as indicated by the Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org comment.

Let me know if you need any further clarification.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the cpu-timer code where the delta for the calling task is added twice, leading to incorrect accounting and potentially causing the sleep to be shorter than expected.

The fix is implemented in the function `cpu_timer_sample_group()` in the file `kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c`. The line `*sample = cputime.sum_exec_runtime + task_delta_exec(p);` is replaced with `*sample = cputime.sum_exec_runtime;`, removing the double accounting.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by several kernel developers, including Peter Zijlstra (Intel), Ingo Molnar, and others. It also includes relevant Cc's to ensure proper notification to the concerned parties.

The patch is fixing the UVD (Unified Video Decoder) suspend and resume functionality for VI (Volcanic Islands) APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) in the amdgpu driver. The issue is that the same handle is being passed before suspend and after resume, causing problems with session and handle destruction.

To address this issue, the patch removes the session and handle destroy operations and keeps the firmware untouched. It also adds a check to skip the suspend and resume operations for APUs, as indicated by the comment "Skip this for APU for now."

The patch has been reviewed by Christian König and signed-off by Leo Liu. It is also marked for stable release and includes the relevant file information.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue without introducing any new problems, it seems appropriate to include it in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is proposing to revert the default behavior of link protections in the Linux VFS. The patch states that enabling the new link protections by default has caused issues with some applications and has broken the way AFD distributes files. As a result, the patch suggests reverting to the legacy behavior to avoid breaking existing systems.

Considering the goal of stable releases is to ensure the reliability and compatibility of the Linux kernel, it would be reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). By reverting to the legacy behavior, it aims to prevent any further disruptions caused by the new link protections.

However, it is important to note that this decision should be made in consultation with the Linux kernel maintainers and the community, who have a better understanding of the potential impact and implications of this change.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a possible race condition in mlx5_core_destroy_mkey() function, where the mr (memory region) is removed from the radix tree before destroying it. This ensures that there is no race if the key was reallocated and an attempt is made to insert it into the radix tree.

2. The patch also handles radix tree insert/delete failures. If the radix tree insert fails, the mr is destroyed and an error message is logged.

3. In mlx5_core_destroy_mkey(), the patch adds code to check if the mr was successfully deleted from the radix tree. If the deletion fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns -ENOENT (No Entry).

4. The patch removes the redundant radix_tree_delete() call after mlx5_cmd_exec(). This call was already performed earlier in the function, so it is not necessary.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential race condition and handles errors related to radix tree operations. It improves the reliability and stability of the mlx5_core module. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the `md_check_recovery` function in `md.c` is calling `->add_disk` unnecessarily, causing unnecessary work and excessive reporting of info messages.

3. The patch includes the necessary Fixes tag, indicating the commit that introduced the issue.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers and reviewed by another developer.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch addresses a specific issue and provides proper error handling. It also has the necessary sign-offs and review. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for preventing the driver from crashing on machines with more cores than the maximum allowed offload queue sets. The patch limits the number of offload queue sets to either the maximum allowed value or the number of online CPUs, whichever is smaller.

Considering the nature of the fix and the potential driver crash issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The commit a544c619a54b introduced delayed work for querying (setting the mode) on all tablets. However, the Bamboo Touch device has a ghost interface that claims to be a pen device. This device needs to have the mode set on the ghost pen interface before it can be removed. However, due to the delay introduced, the device was being removed before the mode setting could be executed.

2. The patch cancels the delayed work using `cancel_delayed_work_sync(&wacom->init_work)`. This ensures that the mode setting is not delayed and can be executed before the device is removed.

3. The patch then calls `_wacom_query_tablet_data(wacom)` to set the mode on the ghost pen interface before proceeding with the removal.

4. The patch handles the specific case of touch-only Bamboo devices that do not support pen functionality.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue related to the Bamboo Touch device and ensures that the mode setting is executed before the device is removed. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to fix a missing spinlock initialization in the aq_ring structure in the Aquantia Ethernet driver. The patch initializes the lock using the `spin_lock_init()` function.

Considering that the patch fixes a bug and adds necessary initialization, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis is required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is aimed at disabling the RHWO (Render Hang Workaround Optimization) optimization for the gen7 Intel graphics driver. The patch includes changes to the i915_reg.h header file and the intel_display.c source file.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Bugzilla references: The patch references two Bugzilla entries (Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41353 and Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44610). These references indicate that there were known issues related to 3D ring hangs, which the patch aims to address.

2. Tested-by: The patch includes a "Tested-by" tag from Eugeni Dodonov, indicating that the patch has been tested and verified by the mentioned individual.

3. Sign-off: The patch includes sign-off tags from Kenneth Graunke and Jesse Barnes, indicating their approval and agreement with the changes.

Considering these factors, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses known issues related to GPU hangs and has been tested and approved by relevant individuals. However, it is always recommended to further review the patch and consider any potential side effects or conflicts with other components before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch addresses an out-of-bounds access issue in the ffs_func_eps_enable() function of the f_fs.c file in the USB gadget driver. The issue occurs when accessing the companion descriptor for SuperSpeed endpoints.

The patch checks if the gadget is SuperSpeed before accessing the companion descriptor. If the gadget is not SuperSpeed, the companion descriptor is not allocated, and accessing it would result in an out-of-bounds access.

Considering the bug report and the patch's fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch correctly handles the case where the companion descriptor is not allocated, preventing the out-of-bounds access issue. Additionally, the patch has been signed-off by the relevant developers, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.
true || Based on the provided patch, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Explanation:
The patch description states that the check of the return value from __find_format() was inverted by mistake. However, the actual patch code does not fix the mistake. 

In the original code, if the format is not found (format is NULL), the patch sets ret to -EINVAL. However, in the patch, the condition is inverted, so if the format is found (format is not NULL), it assigns the format to fmt->format. This is incorrect and does not fix the mistake mentioned in the patch description.

Therefore, the patch does not address the issue correctly and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is removing a useless BUG_ON statement in the i915_gem_entervt_ioctl function. This BUG_ON statement was causing a regression in the 3.5 kernel version.

According to Chris Wilson, the check performed by the BUG_ON statement is a crude approximation and is too late to prevent the hardware from being programmed in an invalid state. Therefore, the removal of this BUG_ON statement is not a concern.

Considering that the patch removes a useless BUG_ON statement and addresses a regression, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch aims to fix a specific issue related to the Xen pciback driver and the resetting of pci_dev->irq to zero when pci_disable_device() is called.

2. The issue occurs when the index of the serial device is incremented even if a deferred probe happens during the clock retrieval in s3c24xx_serial_init_port().
3. This index is used to reference elements of the statically allocated s3c24xx_serial_ports array.
4. In case of re-probe, the index can point outside of the array, leading to memory corruption.
5. The patch fixes the issue by incrementing the index only on a successful probe.
6. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was reported by Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz.

Considering these factors, the patch seems to address a specific issue and improve the functionality of the iwlwifi driver in AP and GO modes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery) algorithm implementation in the TCP stack. The bug causes the sender to incorrectly send more probes than necessary, leading to longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver side.

The patch modifies the code in the tcp_process_loss() function in net/ipv4/tcp_input.c. It changes the condition for resetting the F-RTO state (tp->frto) when the next ACK advances SND_UNA and does not sack a new packet. The patch ensures that the F-RTO state is only reset if the loss was real, as indicated by the FLAG_DATA_SACKED or is_dupack flags.

The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Yuchung Cheng, Neal Cardwell, and David S. Miller.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a bug and improve the behavior of the F-RTO algorithm. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented unnecessary calls to prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions in the DRM atomic helper code. The revert allows the driver to decide when these functions are noops, instead of handling all the special cases in the core.

The reason for the revert is that atomic drivers may set properties like rotation on the same framebuffer, which may require a call to prepare_fb even when the framebuffer stays identical. The original commit aimed to prevent waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates, but it is mentioned that there are better ways to fix this.

The patch has been signed-off by Maarten Lankhorst and Acked-by Laurent Pinchart, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the reasons mentioned in the patch description and the approval from the relevant individuals, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch reverts the commit "drm/radeon: Implement radeon_pci_shutdown" due to a race condition between drm_dev_unregister() and pci_driver.shutdown at shutdown or driver unload time. The comment suggests that there is a need to revisit how to properly support kexec within the drm.

The patch removes the radeon_pci_shutdown() function, which was previously registered as the shutdown callback for the radeon_kms_pci_driver. This function was responsible for unloading the KMS driver.

Since the patch reverts the commit and removes the radeon_pci_shutdown() function, it indicates that the race condition and the associated issues have been addressed. By accepting this patch, the race condition will be resolved, ensuring proper shutdown and driver unload functionality.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the estimation of SYNACK RTT (Round Trip Time) in Fast Open for TCP connections.

2. The patch modifies the function `tcp_synack_rtt_meas()` to take into account the possibility that `tp->lsndtime` may not always be the SYNACK timestamp if a passive Fast Open socket sends data before the handshake completes.

3. The patch introduces the variable `synack_stamp` to store the SYNACK timestamp, which is either obtained from the request socket (`tcp_rsk(req)->snt_synack`) or from `tp->lsndtime` if no request socket is present.

4. The patch then uses `synack_stamp` to calculate the SYNACK RTT (`seq_rtt`) and updates it using `tcp_ack_update_rtt()` if there are no retransmissions (`tp->total_retrans` is zero).

5. Additionally, the patch checks if the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the data packets sent in SYN_RECV. If the smooth RTT (`tp->srtt`) is not set, it calls `tcp_ack_update_rtt()` to update the SYNACK RTT.

6. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers and has been acknowledged by other contributors, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address a specific issue and introduces necessary modifications to improve the SYNACK RTT estimation in Fast Open. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch adds a reject for the MPC5121 platform if an input-only pin is requested to be set as an output. This is done to comply with the reference manual (18.3.1.1). This change ensures that input-only pins cannot be mistakenly set as output pins.

2. The patch also rewrites the mach-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which improves scalability. This change aims to make the code more efficient and maintainable.

3. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors, indicating their agreement with the changes made.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue related to the MPC5121 platform and improves the code's efficiency and maintainability.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm (memory management) in the Nouveau DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a specific resource, and it helps avoid the need for additional checks for the mm's existence throughout the codebase.

2. The patch modifies the `nouveau_mm_init` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/core/mm.c`. It introduces a conditional check for the `length` parameter. If `length` is non-zero, it calculates the `offset` and `length` values as before. Otherwise, it skips these calculations, effectively creating a zero-sized mm.

3. The patch also removes the `heap_size` member from the `struct nouveau_mm` in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/include/core/mm.h`. This suggests that the `heap_size` is no longer needed or used, which is consistent with the changes made in `nouveau_mm_init`.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable improvement that allows for more flexibility in managing memory resources in the Nouveau DRM driver. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the current implementation of `smp_call_function()` in the `intel_idle` driver is being misused. The patch suggests replacing the `smp_call_function()` calls with `on_each_cpu()` calls.

The `smp_call_function()` function is used to execute a specific function on all other CPUs, while `on_each_cpu()` is used to execute a specific function on all CPUs, including the calling CPU. 

In this case, the patch is fixing an API misuse by replacing the `smp_call_function()` calls with `on_each_cpu()` calls. This change ensures that all CPUs execute the specific functions in the `intel_idle` driver, which is the expected behavior.

Considering the nature of the fix and the potential impact on power management, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a memory leak issue in the USB gadget driver (bdc_ep.c). The issue occurs when dma_pool_alloc() fails to allocate memory for bd_table->start_bd. In the current code, if allocation fails, the code jumps to the "fail" label and releases all the bd_tables that have been added to the chain. However, it misses freeing the bd_table that was just allocated and not yet added to the chain.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a kfree() call to free the bd_table before jumping to the "fail" label.

This fix ensures that the memory allocated for bd_table is properly freed in case of allocation failure, preventing a memory leak.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Overall, the patch adds necessary checks to prevent potential buffer overflows and ensures the integrity of the message lengths. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the "weak" attribute from the declaration of the clocksource_default_clock() function in the clocksource.h header file. This function provides a default clocksource definition that is marked as weak, allowing architectures to override it with their own definition.

However, in the case of the s390 architecture, the weak attribute on the declaration caused issues because the s390 definition was also marked as weak. This resulted in the linker choosing one definition based on link order, which was not the intended behavior.

By removing the "weak" attribute from the declaration, the patch ensures that a non-weak definition is always preferred over the weak one, regardless of link order. This resolves the issue and ensures that the correct clocksource definition is used.

The patch also includes the necessary Fixes tag and is signed-off by the author and acknowledged by other relevant individuals.

Therefore, considering the fix and the potential impact on stability, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the staging driver for the IIO accelerometer (sca3000_core.c). The function sca3000_read_ctrl_reg() returns a negative number on failure, but the current code checks for a non-zero value to determine if there was an error. This is incorrect because a negative value indicates an error, not just any non-zero value.

The patch modifies the code to check for a negative value (ret < 0) instead of just checking for a non-zero value. This ensures that the error condition is properly handled.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Cc tags for proper attribution and tracking.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward fix for an error check, and it does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and a more thorough review of the code and testing is recommended before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where a user can set a too small tick value with a fine-grained timer like hrtimer, causing the kernel to fire up the timer irq too frequently. This can lead to condensed locks and potential kernel spinlock lockup with warnings.

To avoid this situation, the patch introduces a lower limit of the resolution, which is set to 1ms. If the user passes a tick value resulting in a resolution less than 1ms, the kernel returns -EINVAL (invalid argument) now.

The patch also includes a check for the timer's hardware flags. If the timer is not a slave timer, it performs additional checks on the tick value. It calculates the resolution by multiplying the tick value with the timer's resolution and ensures that it is not less than 1ms. If the resolution is less than 1ms, the kernel returns -EINVAL.

Overall, this patch improves the stability of the kernel by preventing potential lockups caused by too frequent timer irq firing. It also adds a check for the tick value to ensure it meets the minimum resolution requirement.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where, if a port is unplugged while a user is blocked on a read operation, subsequent read operations return 0 instead of -ENODEV, indicating that there is no host-side connection but not indicating that the device went away. This can lead to confusion for users who are not monitoring the SIGIO signal.

The patch fixes this by returning -ENODEV on all read operations after the port gets unplugged. It checks if the port is hot-unplugged and returns -ENODEV immediately. Additionally, it handles the case where the port gets unplugged while waiting for data during the read operation.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of BUG_ON() statements in the btrfs_map_block function. BUG_ON() statements are typically used to indicate a critical error condition that should never occur. However, in the case of file system corruption, it is possible for btrfs_map_block to encounter unexpected situations. Removing the BUG_ON() statements allows the code to handle such situations gracefully instead of triggering a panic.

2. The patch introduces error handling code in case the stripe math or stripe index calculations go wrong. It logs an error message and returns an appropriate error code (-EINVAL) instead of panicking. This improves the robustness of the code and helps prevent potential crashes or data corruption.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch addresses potential issues in the btrfs_map_block function and improves the error handling in the face of file system corruption. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the qla4xxx driver where the loop may continue indefinitely if qla4xxx_get_fwddb_entry returns QLA_ERROR. The current code uses the "continue" statement, which means it will skip the rest of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in this case, the "idx" variable is not updated, potentially causing the loop condition "idx < max_ddbs" to never be met.

The patch fixes this by explicitly incrementing "next_idx" in the error condition. This ensures that the loop will eventually terminate by incrementing the index and moving to the next iteration.

The patch also suggests using a "break" statement instead of "continue" to leave the decision on the qlogic maintainer. While this change is not strictly necessary for fixing the issue, it provides flexibility for future modifications.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential infinite loop issue and improves the code's clarity. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid bug fix and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch addresses an issue where reading ACLs from the server can cause a buffer overflow if the bitmap size plus the ACL size is greater than a PAGE_SIZE, but the ACL size itself is smaller than a PAGE_SIZE. The patch modifies the `nfs4_write_cached_acl` function to use `_copy_from_pages` instead of `memcpy` to avoid reading past the buffer page boundary.

Additionally, the patch removes the unused variable `resp_buf` and updates the `nfs4_write_cached_acl` function calls in the `__nfs4_get_acl_uncached` function to pass the correct parameters.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential buffer overflow issue and makes necessary code adjustments. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to fix a rounding error in the calculation of the `limits->max_policy_pct` value in the `intel_pstate` driver. The current calculation rounds down the value, which results in the CPU frequency not reaching the expected maximum frequency.

The patch proposes to use the `DIV_ROUND_UP()` macro to round up the value instead, ensuring that the maximum frequency is correctly set. The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by multiple individuals, including maintainers and developers from Intel and Linaro.

Considering the nature of the issue and the acknowledgment from relevant parties, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the openvswitch module related to retrieving TCP flags. Currently, the code checks if the IP header indicates the presence of a TCP header but does not verify if the packet is long enough to contain the header. This can lead to reading off the end of the packet, resulting in reading bad data.

The patch adds a length check to ensure that the packet is long enough to contain the TCP header before attempting to retrieve the TCP flags. It uses the `skb_transport_offset` function to calculate the offset of the TCP header and checks if the packet length is greater than or equal to the sum of the offset and the size of the TCP header (`sizeof(struct tcphdr)`).

The patch also includes a comment explaining that reading beyond the packet's end is unlikely to cause a crash due to the presence of `struct skb_shared_info` at the end of the packet.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue of reading off the end of the packet and adds a necessary length check. It does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch appears to address a warning related to array bounds in the eicon driver of the ISDN subsystem. The code change modifies the PUT_WORD() macro to directly assign the values to the array elements, avoiding the warning.

Considering that the patch is intended to fix a warning and does not introduce any new functionality or bug fixes, it can be considered a low-risk change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch aims to fix failures in handling -1 (0xffff) uid's and gid's in the svcrpc module. The patch addresses an issue where rpc containing a -1 uid or gid would fail with a badcred error. 

The patch has been tested and reported by Sven Geggus, and it has also been signed-off by J. Bruce Fields. Additionally, it includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to fix a bug related to divides by zero errors in the __tcp_select_window() function. The bug occurs when inet_csk_route_child_sock() returns a NULL pointer, leading to freeing a new socket while the keepalive timer is still armed in tcp_create_openreq_child().

The patch proposes a fix by calling tcp_clear_xmit_timers() before unlocking the socket and freeing it. This action ensures that the xmit timers are cleared before the socket is released.

Considering the nature of the bug and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or side effects.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses error handling in the udc_pci_probe() function of the amd5536udc USB gadget driver.
2. Currently, if a failure occurs early in udc_pci_probe(), the error handling code only frees the device and returns. This patch adds proper resource deallocations in udc_pci_probe() itself, as udc_pci_remove() is not suitable to be called so early in the initialization process.
3. The patch also replaces iounmap(dev->regs) with iounmap(dev->virt_addr) in udc_pci_remove() for clarity.
4. The patch is signed-off by Alexey Khoroshilov <khoroshilov@ispras.ru> and Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fix it provides, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential crash issue and improves the stability of the max8997-haptic driver.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend giving it a NAK (not accepted in Linux -stable releases). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes a broken attempt at GPU reset using genpd. The author has confirmed that it doesn't work, and they plan to address it properly later. Removing broken code is generally a good practice.

2. The patch also caused build breakage due to using CONFIG_PM_SLEEP functions without the corresponding Kconfig dependency on PM_SLEEP. This indicates that the code is not properly integrated with the build system.

3. The patch introduces a new implementation for vc4_v3d_set_power, which is intended for GPU reset. However, the implementation is incomplete and returns 0 without performing any actual reset. This suggests that the functionality is not fully implemented or tested.

Given these points, it seems that the patch is not ready for inclusion in stable releases. It removes broken code but introduces incomplete and untested functionality. It would be better to address the GPU reset properly and ensure that the code is integrated correctly with the build system before considering it for inclusion in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is addressing a bug where a NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `tipc_nl_publ_dump()` function if the socket for which the user is listing publication does not exist.

The patch addresses an issue where calling regulator_get with a NULL dev argument causes an error when printing /sys/kernel/debug/regulator_summary. The patch explicitly handles "deviceless" consumers in the debugfs code to fix this issue.

The changes in the patch are as follows:
- In the function `regulator_summary_show_subtree`, a check is added to skip consumers with a NULL dev argument.
- The `seq_printf` call is modified to use `dev_name(consumer->dev)` if `consumer->dev` is not NULL, otherwise it uses the string "deviceless".

These changes ensure that the debugfs code handles "deviceless" consumers correctly and avoids the error when printing the regulator summary.

The patch also includes proper sign-offs from the authors and relevant Cc's to the stable and regulator core maintainers.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch introduces a new interface called add_device_randomness() for adding data to the random pool that is likely to differ between devices or even per boot.
   - This is useful for devices that might otherwise be identical and have very little entropy available to them, especially in the embedded world.

2. Changes made by the patch:
   - The patch adds the add_device_randomness() function to the random.c file.
   - The function takes a buffer and its size as input and adds the data to the input and nonblocking pools.
   - It also mixes in a timestamp to introduce some variability caused by the time needed to detect/configure the hardware.

3. Impact of the patch:
   - The patch does not add any actual entropy to the pool but initializes the pool to different values for devices that might otherwise be identical.
   - This helps avoid the problem of the nonblocking pool having similar initial state across largely identical devices.
   - The patch does not introduce any performance or security concerns.

4. Patch authorship and review:
   - The patch is signed-off by Linus Torvalds and Theodore Ts'o, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.
   - The patch is also CC'd to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list and the drivers/char/random.c file, suggesting it has undergone community review.

1. Purpose: The patch aims to set the input device's vendor and product IDs for the elan_i2c driver. Previously, these IDs were reported as 0000, but with this patch, the Elan vendor ID and touchpad's product ID will be included.

2. Generic Elan gestures config: The patch enables the application of a generic Elan gestures config that will be applicable to all Elan touchpads on ChromeOS. This config relies on matching input devices based on the vendor ID. By adding this patch, the default Elan touchpad config can be applied to Elan touchpads in this kernel by matching devices with the vendor ID 04f3.

3. Product ID availability: The patch also mentions that the product ID is available via a custom sysfs entry "product_id."

4. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Charlie Mooney and Dmitry Torokhov, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes made.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the call to `nfs4_ds_disconnect(clp)` in the `filelayout_async_handle_error` function in `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.c`. The reason for removing this call is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing `ds->ds_clp` during or after the call, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and a potential Oops.

Instead of relying on `nfs4_ds_disconnect`, the patch suggests relying on `filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()` to avoid any issues with the device ID. This change ensures that the device ID is marked as invalid, preventing any further trouble.

The patch also removes the declaration and definition of `nfs4_ds_disconnect` from `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayout.h` and `fs/nfs/nfs4filelayoutdev.c` respectively. This function was responsible for disconnecting the data server associated with the NFS client. However, it is no longer needed after the changes made in `filelayout_async_handle_error`.

Overall, the patch seems to address a potential issue and simplifies the code by removing unnecessary function calls. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the ixgbe driver's offline self-test. Currently, when running the offline self-test, the dev_close() function is called, which clears the IFF_UP flag. This behavior removes the interface's routes and some addresses, which may not be the intended behavior for users running the self-test. Additionally, this behavior is inconsistent because it does not occur if the interface is brought down before the test.

The patch suggests calling the net_device_ops ndo_stop function directly instead of dev_close(). This change avoids touching the IFF_UP flag altogether and ensures consistent behavior. The patch also includes modifications to the ixgbe_open() and ixgbe_close() functions to make them accessible from other files.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of the ixgbe driver's offline self-test. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests reverting a deprecation warning for the SCTP_SNDRCV support in the SCTP socket implementation. The reasons for reverting the warning are as follows:

1) The SCTP_SNDRCV support is part of the user API (uapi) and is considered set in stone, meaning it will not change in the future. Therefore, there is no need for a deprecation warning.

2) To ensure compatibility with both older and newer kernels, SCTP applications need to probe for both SCTP_SNDRCV and SCTP_SNDINFO/SCTP_RCVINFO support. Many SCTP appliances are slow to migrate to newer kernels, so it is necessary to support SCTP_SNDRCV on older kernels.

3) Some users may not have the ability to change their applications due to proprietary legacy systems. These users will encounter the deprecation warning and be stuck with older kernels.

Considering these reasons, it seems reasonable to revert the deprecation warning. The patch has been reported by Jamal Hadi Salim and has been reviewed and acknowledged by him. It has also been signed-off by Daniel Borkmann and Michael Tuexen.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function in the be_cmds.c file of the be2net driver. The problem is that the mcc/mbox lock is not being released when be_cmd_copy() returns an error.

The patch modifies the code to release the lock and return -EBUSY in case be_cmd_copy() fails. It introduces a new label "unlock" and a "goto" statement to jump to that label when be_cmd_copy() fails. This ensures that the mcc/mbox lock is released before returning from the function.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by lines, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a potential resource leak and improves the error handling in the be_cmd_notify_wait() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses two main issues. Firstly, it avoids using variable-length arrays in kernel/sys.c. Variable-length arrays can generate worse code and may lead to compiler issues, as reported on the POWER architecture. Since variable-length arrays are generally discouraged, it is a good practice to avoid them.

Secondly, the patch fixes the size of the array "buf" in the "override_release" function from being dynamically allocated based on the "len" parameter to a fixed size of 65. This change ensures that the array size is always valid and eliminates any potential buffer overflow issues.

The patch also includes proper attribution to the reporter and relevant individuals in the commit message.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a reasonable and necessary improvement, and therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch disables the use of shadow registers by default in the iwlwifi driver. Shadow registers are used to update certain device registers without waking up all components of the device. However, using this feature has caused communication issues and host command timeouts.

2. The patch sets the `shadow_reg_enable` parameter to `false` for multiple iwlwifi devices (`iwl2000`, `iwl2030`, `iwl6000`, `iwl6050`, `iwl6000_g2`). This effectively disables the use of shadow registers until a fix is available for the bugs associated with this feature.

3. The patch includes appropriate comments indicating that the feature should be fixed before enabling it again.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Meenakshi Venkataraman, Johannes Berg, and John W. Linville.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the VLAN null pointer issue for 57710 and 57711 adapters.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve the dwc3_gadget_resize_tx_fifos() function in the dwc3 gadget driver. It modifies the loop that iterates over the endpoints to only iterate over IN endpoints that are actually present, based on the num_in_eps parameter. This change prevents dereferencing a potential NULL dwc->eps[i] where i >= (num_in_eps + num_out_eps).

The patch replaces the existing loop condition "num < DWC3_ENDPOINTS_NUM" with "num < dwc->num_in_eps" to limit the iteration to the number of IN endpoints. It also updates the calculation of the endpoint index to use the new loop variable "num" instead of "dep->number >> 1".

The change in the loop condition and endpoint index calculation ensures that only valid IN endpoints are processed, improving the efficiency of the function.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the dwc3 gadget driver, addressing a potential NULL pointer dereference issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch reverts a previous commit that caused a regression on the GeekBox and Banana Pi M1 boards when connected to a real transceiver instead of a switch via fixed-link. The commit being reverted is identified by its commit hash (88f8b1bb41c6208f81b6a480244533ded7b59493).

The changes made by the patch include modifications to the stmmac_mdio_register function in stmmac_mdio.c and the stmmac_probe_config_dt function in stmmac_platform.c. In stmmac_mdio_register, the code now checks for a compatible child node "snps,dwmac-mdio" within the device's of_node. If found, it sets the mdio_node variable accordingly. In stmmac_probe_config_dt, the code no longer searches for a child node with the "snps,dwmac-mdio" compatibility string and instead checks if the plat->phy_bus_name variable is set.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to determine the exact implications of the changes and whether they are necessary for stable releases. However, considering that the patch reverts a previous commit due to specific board-related issues, it is likely that the patch addresses a specific problem and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch suggests using the timer API functions `setup_timer` and `mod_timer` instead of directly assigning values to the timer structure fields. This change aligns with the standard way of setting timers and updating the expire field of an active timer.

The patch modifies the `pasemi_mac_open` function in the `pasemi_mac.c` file. It replaces the usage of `init_timer` and direct structure assignments with `setup_timer` and `mod_timer` functions for the `mac->tx->clean_timer` timer.

By using `setup_timer`, the timer is initialized with the provided function (`pasemi_mac_tx_timer`) and data (`(unsigned long)mac->tx`). Then, `mod_timer` is used to update the expire field of the timer with the current time plus `HZ` (the number of timer ticks per second).

Overall, this patch improves the code by using the recommended timer API functions, making it more maintainable and aligned with standard practices. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

It seems to provide a necessary fix for a device-specific problem and does not introduce any obvious negative side effects. However, further testing and review by the Linux kernel maintainers would be necessary to ensure its compatibility and effectiveness in the broader Linux ecosystem.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a regression: The patch fixes a regression where the driver fails when Device Tree (DT) is enabled. This regression is caused by the code not executing the DT probing when platform data is available. The patch aims to resolve this issue.

2. Rejigging probe() semantics: The patch modifies the probe() semantics to attempt to extract a platform ID from Device Tree if it cannot be sourced from platform data. This change ensures that the driver can handle both cases (with and without DT) correctly.

3. Simplification of code: The patch removes unnecessary checks for platform data and executes the DT case only when platform data is not available. This simplifies the code and improves readability.

4. Proper error handling: The patch adds proper error handling by returning -ENODEV when both platform data and DT are missing. This ensures that the driver fails gracefully when essential data is not available.

5. Signed-off-by: The patch has been signed-off by Lee Jones and Linus Walleij, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for enabling vsync interrupt while waiting for vblank in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) driver for Exynos GPUs. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. The patch adds a call to `drm_vblank_get()` before setting the `wait_vsync_event` atomic variable to 1. This function increments the reference count for the vblank interrupt handling for the specified CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller) device and pipe.

2. After setting the `wait_vsync_event` variable, the patch adds a timeout loop that waits for the `wait_vsync_event` variable to be cleared by the vsync interrupt handler routine. If the timeout occurs, a debug message is printed.

3. Finally, the patch adds a call to `drm_vblank_put()` to decrement the reference count for the vblank interrupt handling.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) to be included in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a potential issue with vsync interrupt handling and ensures proper enabling and disabling of interrupts during the vblank wait.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not take into account any potential interactions or dependencies with other parts of the Linux kernel. A more comprehensive analysis would require a deeper understanding of the specific subsystem and the overall impact of the patch.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is intended to drop a workaround (WA) for the latest revision of the Valleyview (VLV) chipset in order to fix an issue related to voltage not getting dropped to Vmin when the graphics (Gfx) is power gated.

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue related to the wm8962 codec driver. By turning on the regcache_cache_only flag before disabling the regulator, the patch ensures that the driver will turn off the regcache_cache_only flag after enabling the regulator. This is done to prevent failures when running commands like 'amixer cset' before wm8962_resume().

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and Cc entries.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable and necessary fix for the mentioned issue, and it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes the usage of the exit() function in the tools/hv/hv_kvp_daemon.c file. Instead of using exit(-1), which results in an exit code of 255, the patch replaces it with exit(EXIT_FAILURE), which is a portable value and more appropriate for a daemon.

The change ensures that the exit code is within the range of valid Linux native exit codes and avoids potential confusion with the exit code 255, which is typically reserved for reporting 'command not found' in shells.

The patch also includes proper error handling and logging for various failure scenarios, such as failing to acquire/release locks, opening files, allocating memory, creating directories, creating sockets, binding, and sending messages via netlink.

Overall, the patch improves the robustness and reliability of the code by using appropriate exit codes and providing better error handling. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire Linux kernel codebase is still necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a bug in the ocfs2_file_aio_write() function. The bug occurs when ocfs2_inode_lock() fails, causing the function to skip unlocking the rw lock. This can lead to issues in ocfs2_lock_res_free().

Considering the potential bug and the fact that the patch appears to fix it, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a reported issue where the GRO (Generic Receive Offload) L2 header check fails on IB/ipoib (InfiniBand over IP) traffic. The patch proposes a more generic approach to the L2 header check, taking into account the hard_header_len instead of assuming a fixed L2 header size of 14 bytes.

The patch introduces a new variable, maclen, which holds the value of skb->dev->hard_header_len. This variable is then used to determine the appropriate comparison method for the L2 header check.

If maclen is equal to ETH_HLEN (Ethernet header length), the existing compare_ether_header function is used to compare the L2 headers of the received packet and the aggregated packet. Otherwise, if maclen is not equal to ETH_HLEN, a memcmp function is used to compare the L2 headers.

The patch ensures that the L2 header check is performed correctly for both Ethernet and non-Ethernet traffic, addressing the reported issue.

Given that the patch provides a fix for a specific issue and introduces a more generic approach to the L2 header check, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes were made to fix a mis-merge in gmap handling for the s390 architecture in the Linux kernel. The commit message explains that some changes were dropped during a previous split of the pgtable.c file, which caused issues with KVM for certain memory sizes.

The patch itself modifies the gmap_map_segment() function in the gmap.c file. It updates the condition for checking the validity of the memory range being mapped. The original condition checked if the end address of the range exceeded the maximum size of the task, but the patch modifies it to check if the end address minus one exceeds the maximum size of the task. This change ensures that the memory range is properly validated.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific issue caused by a mis-merge and improves the correctness of the gmap_map_segment() function for the s390 architecture.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch fixes a check for port PM availability in the amdgpu driver.
2. It addresses an issue where the ATPX method may not always exist on the dGPU and could be located at the iGPU instead.
3. The parent device of the iGPU is the root port for which bridge_d3 is false. This accidentally enables the legacy PM method, which conflicts with port PM and prevents the dGPU from powering on.
4. The patch fixes the power state when port PM is unavailable.
5. It includes a reported-and-tested-by tag from Mike Lothian and signed-off-by tags from Peter Wu and Alex Deucher.
6. The patch also includes a Cc tag for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it should be considered for stable releases.

It addresses a specific issue related to port PM availability and has been tested and reported by a user. Additionally, it includes appropriate sign-offs and a request for consideration in stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is a revert of a previous commit (3c424f359898aff48c3d5bed608ac706f8a528c3) that fixed a boundary check issue in the ioremap function for ARM architecture.

2. The revert is requested by Joachim Eastwood, who reported that the original fix caused booting issues on their custom AT91RM9200 board. Reverting the patch resolved the booting problem.

3. Further debugging revealed that the original fix introduced a flawed if statement, causing incorrect mapping of memory areas. The condition checking boundaries of the requested and existing mappings did not consider the in-page offset, leading to incorrect mapping and hard-to-debug problems.

4. The original premise of the fix patch was also found to be incorrect, as the code already accounted for the requested offset into the page.

5. Nicolas Pitre, an acknowledged contributor, has reviewed and approved the revert.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to accept the revert patch in Linux -stable releases to resolve the booting issue and avoid incorrect memory mapping.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `cvm_oct_napi_poll` function in the `drivers/staging/octeon/ethernet-rx.c` file. Here are the changes made by the patch:

1. Line 303: A new line `rx_count++;` is added. This increments the `rx_count` variable.

2. Line 429: The line `rx_count++;` is commented out. This means that the `rx_count` variable is not incremented for certain conditions.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch intends to count dropped packets in order to prevent the NAPI handler from running for too long. However, it is not clear why the `rx_count` variable is incremented in one place and commented out in another.

Without further context or explanation, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose and correctness of the changes made by the patch. Therefore, I would recommend further review and clarification before accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

My decision is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further review and clarification.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a potential lost wakeup scenario in the TIOCMIWAIT ioctl function of the quatech_usb2 driver. The patch aims to address this issue by modifying the logic in the qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) loop.

true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the xmon data-breakpoint feature, which is currently broken. The issue arises when a watchpoint match occurs, and the hw_breakpoint_handler is called by do_break via notifier chains mechanism. If the watchpoint is registered by xmon, the hw_breakpoint_handler does not find any associated perf_event and returns immediately with NOTIFY_STOP. As a result, do_break also returns without notifying xmon.

The proposed solution in the patch is to modify the return value of hw_breakpoint_handler when no perf_event is associated with the matched watchpoint. Instead of returning NOTIFY_STOP, which would skip notifying xmon, the patch suggests returning NOTIFY_DONE. This change ensures that the core code continues calling other breakpoint handlers, including the xmon one.

The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and is also marked for stable@vger.kernel.org. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and tested by the authors and is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

1. The patch addresses a bug in the RTC tracking code that can lead to a negative value in the `pending_eoi` variable.
2. The patch introduces a new function `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` to check if `pending_eoi` is negative and recover from it by calling `kvm_rtc_eoi_tracking_restore_all`.
3. The patch modifies the existing functions `__rtc_irq_eoi_tracking_restore_one` and `rtc_irq_eoi` to call `rtc_status_pending_eoi_check_valid` after decrementing `pending_eoi`.
4. The patch adds a comment in `ioapic_service` to clarify that `pending_eoi` cannot be negative and that the caller ensures it is only called if `rtc_irq_check_coalesced` returns false.
5. The patch includes proper sign-off and authorship information.

Overall, the patch fixes a potential bug and adds error recovery to prevent further issues. It seems well-implemented and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch reverts a previous commit that attempted to fix the wrong value of "capacity_now" reported when the battery is fully charged. The revert is justified by explaining that it is normal for "capacity_now" to increase above the "full_charge_capacity" value due to different charging cycles. Good battery firmwares will update "full_charge_capacity" when the current charging cycle is complete, even if it goes above the "design_capacity" on a fresh and healthy battery.

The patch argues that capping "capacity_now" to "full_charge_capacity" is incorrect and that printing a warning if they don't match the "design_capacity" is both annoying and wrong. It mentions that the current behavior results in bogus warnings on perfectly working systems/firmwares and wrong values being reported for "capacity_now" and "full_charge_capacity" after the warning has been triggered.

Considering these arguments, it seems reasonable to accept the patch and revert the previous commit. This will prevent unnecessary warnings and ensure accurate reporting of battery capacity.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not take into account other factors or dependencies within the Linux kernel codebase.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The mcb_probe() function in the mcb-core.c file does not acquire a reference to the probed device but drops one when removing the device. This can lead to a panic found with a rmmod/modprobe stress test.

2. The patch proposes a solution: The patch adds a call to get_device(dev) in the mcb_probe() function to acquire a reference to the device before using it.

3. The issue is reported by Andreas Werner and tested by the same person, which adds credibility to the problem and the proposed solution.

4. The patch is also signed-off by Johannes Thumshirn and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept the patch in Linux -stable releases to address the reported issue and prevent potential panics.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is correcting an incorrect configuration of the number of PWM channels for the LPC32xx SoC. The patch changes the value of `lpc32xx->chip.npwm` from 2 to 1, indicating that there is only one PWM controller with one output channel, rather than two PWM controllers with one output channel each.

Considering that the patch fixes a configuration issue and ensures separate configuration of different clock parents and gates for both PWM controllers, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific problem in the xhci-hcd's resume routine. It ensures that both root hubs are resumed when the controller is runtime-resumed, avoiding a race condition where the controller might be put back to sleep before handling the wakeup condition.

2. The patch simplifies the logic in xhci_resume by combining some repeated flag settings into a single pair of statements, improving code readability and maintainability.

3. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Alan Stern and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

2. The warning is related to an incorrect type in argument 2.
3. The expected type is "restricted __be32 const [usertype] *addr".
4. The actual type is "unsigned int const [usertype] *[assigned] reg".
5. The patch changes the type of the variable "reg" from "const u32 *" to "const __be32 *".
6. This change aligns the type with the expected type, resolving the warning.
7. The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags.

Overall, the patch addresses a warning and ensures the correct type is used in the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes an unbalanced mutex in the dma_pool_create() function. In the original code, if device_create_file() fails, the mutex is not unlocked before returning, leading to a potential deadlock scenario.

The fix assigns NULL to the 'retval' variable before returning, ensuring that the mutex is unlocked before exiting the function in case of an error. This resolves the unbalanced mutex issue.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags and a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug introduced in the 3.16 kernel and provides a proper fix for the issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a regression in the arm64 VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) related to coarse clock monotonicity. Since the commit 906c55579a63, it has become possible to obtain a timestamp for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE or CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE via syscall and subsequently obtain a timestamp for the same clock ID via VDSO, which predates the first timestamp by one jiffy.

The issue arises because the arm64's update_vsyscall function is using the __current_kernel_time interface to derive the coarse time, instead of using the timekeeper object provided by the timekeeping core. Previously, it worked because __current_kernel_time would access the same timekeeper object passed to update_vsyscall, but that is no longer the case.

The patch fixes this by updating the vdso_data structure with the correct values from the timekeeper object. It sets vdso_data->xtime_coarse_sec to tk->xtime_sec and vdso_data->xtime_coarse_nsec to tk->tkr_mono.xtime_nsec shifted by tk->tkr_mono.shift.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific regression and provides a proper fix for the issue. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Explanation:
The patch addresses an issue where the autoload functionality doesn't work for the net DSA b53 driver when it is built as a module. This is because the module alias information is not filled, preventing user-space from matching the registered device with the corresponding module.

The patch solves this problem by exporting the module alias information using the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro. After applying the patch, the modinfo command shows the module alias information for the b53_mmap.ko module.

The patch also includes the necessary Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

Overall, this patch improves the functionality of the net DSA b53 driver when built as a module, and it does not introduce any apparent issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug where the i2c-hid driver tries to power down the device by sending a PWR_SLEEP command after the command buffer has been released. This results in a kernel crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.

The fix modifies the i2c_hid_stop() function by removing the call to i2c_hid_free_buffers(). This ensures that the buffers are not freed when the i2c-hid driver itself is unloaded.

The patch includes the Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by commit 34f439e4afcd. It also includes the Reported-by, Signed-off-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that the issue was reported, the fix was tested, and it was reviewed by other developers.

Overall, the patch appears to be a targeted fix for a specific bug and has been properly reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch is titled "drm/i915: Flush the PTEs after updating them before suspend." It addresses a regression that causes harm even after previous attempts to fix it. The patch fixes the issue by flushing the Page Table Entries (PTEs) after updating them before suspending the system.

The patch includes changes to the i915_gem_suspend_gtt_mappings() and i915_gem_restore_gtt_mappings() functions in the i915 driver. In the i915_gem_suspend_gtt_mappings() function, after zapping all the PTEs, the i915_ggtt_flush() function is called to flush the TLBs (Translation Lookaside Buffers) on the hardware. Similarly, in the i915_gem_restore_gtt_mappings() function, the i915_ggtt_flush() function is called again to flush the TLBs.

The patch also includes a new static function, i915_ggtt_flush(), which handles the TLB flushing based on the hardware generation.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch addresses a regression and provides a fix for a known issue. It introduces a new function and modifies existing functions to ensure proper TLB flushing before suspending and restoring the system.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a regression, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt) domain and IRQ affinity.
2. The patch sets the IRQ_NO_BALANCING flag to prevent the affinity from being overwritten by setup_affinity().
3. Without this patch, if an IPI is reserved for a single target CPU and allocated using __setup_irq(), the affinity is overwritten with cpu_online_mask. This can lead to issues when ipi_destroy() is called on a multi-CPU system, causing a crash.
4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it resolves a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple individuals, including the original author and maintainers of relevant subsystems.
6. The patch includes appropriate Cc (Carbon copy) recipients, ensuring that relevant parties are notified of the patch.
7. The patch includes a link to the original discussion thread on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) for reference.

Based on these factors, it appears that the patch is well-documented, addresses a specific issue, and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific case where acpi_find_child_device() function does not handle devices with the same _ADR value and different _HID/_CID values correctly. The current behavior is not defined by the spec, and the patch aims to improve it.

The patch modifies the find_child_checks() function to prefer devices without ACPI/PNP device IDs over devices that have them. This change ensures that devices without valid ACPI/PNP device IDs are matched first when multiple devices have the same _ADR value.

The patch has been suggested by Mika Westerberg and signed-off by Rafael J. Wysocki. It has also been tested by Hans de Goede.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and improves the behavior of acpi_find_child_device(). It has been reviewed and tested, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made in the patch.

The patch modifies the ARMv8_EVTYPE_MASK value in the arm64/kernel/perf_event.c file. The original value was 0xc00000ff, and it is changed to 0xc80000ff.

The patch is a port of a previous fix for ARMv7, which fixed the EVTYPE_MASK to include the NSH bit. This change allows profiling at EL2.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It fixes a broken evtype mask and enables profiling at EL2 for arm64 architecture.

Please note that this recommendation is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may require further testing and verification.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a memory leak issue related to the "resume_latency.notifiers" field in the PM/QoS subsystem.
2. The commit message explains that the behavior was changed in a previous commit, but the "notifiers" field is not used in the "latency_tolerance" structure.
3. The patch restores the original behavior of freeing the "notifiers" pointer on "qos->resume_latency", which is the correct field to be freed.
4. It also fixes the reported kmemleak warning, indicating that the patch resolves an actual issue.

Considering these points, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the memory leak and address the kmemleak warning.
true || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch addresses a valid issue and has undergone proper review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock, which is claimed to serialize tve_enable/disable calls. However, the DRM already serializes mode sets with a mutex, preventing concurrent calls to encoder/connector functions. Therefore, the enable_lock is unnecessary.

2. Holding a spinlock while calling clk_prepare_enable() is incorrect and can cause a might_sleep() warning if debugging is enabled. Removing the enable_lock resolves this issue.

3. The patch removes the enable_lock spinlock from the struct imx_tve, as well as the spin_lock_init() call for enable_lock.

4. The tve_enable() and tve_disable() functions no longer acquire/release the enable_lock spinlock.

5. The patch does not introduce any new code or functionality, but rather removes unnecessary code.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a clean and valid improvement. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of stack-allocated buffers for DMA in the stk-webcam driver.

2. The patch allocates a buffer using kmalloc() instead of using a stack-allocated buffer. This ensures that the buffer is allocated in a DMA-enabled area, which is necessary for USB control messages to work correctly.

3. The patch correctly checks if the buffer allocation fails and returns an error (-ENOMEM) in such cases.

4. The patch uses the allocated buffer (buf) in the usb_control_msg() function instead of the stack-allocated buffer previously used. This ensures that the DMA operation is performed correctly.

5. The patch also correctly handles the return value of usb_control_msg() and copies the received value into the provided value pointer using memcpy().

6. The patch frees the allocated buffer using kfree() before returning from the function.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with DMA usage in the stk-webcam driver and provides a proper solution by using dynamically allocated buffers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses two issues:
   a. It fixes the lack of checking the return value of `rpc_clone_client()`.
   b. It resolves a memory leak caused by not shutting down the cloned `rpc_clnt` in the case of `NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC`.

2. By moving the call to `rpc_clone_client()` after `nfs4_proc_lookup_common()` has completed its execution, the code is simplified.

3. The patch includes a reported-by tag, indicating that the issue was identified by Andy Adamson.

4. The patch is signed-off by Trond Myklebust, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch aims to improve SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) balancing in cases where there is an idle core that shares cache.
   - It avoids selecting a sibling thread in the select_idle_sibling() function if there is an idle core available to balance to.

2. Changes made by the patch:
   - The patch introduces a new variable "smt" to track whether SMT balancing is needed.
   - It adds a loop labeled "again" to iterate through the sched_domains and find an eligible idle CPU.
   - It skips sched_domains that have the SD_SHARE_CPUPOWER flag set and SMT balancing is not required.
   - It stops looking for an idle sibling when it reaches the domain that spans the current CPU and the previous CPU.
   - It checks if the sched_group intersects with the allowed CPUs of the task and selects the first idle CPU from the group.

3. Test and verification:
   - The patch has been tested by Mike Galbraith and found to fix the SMT balancing issue.
   - The patch includes a Tested-by tag from Mike Galbraith.

4. Patch authorship and source:
   - The patch is signed-off by Peter Zijlstra and Ingo Molnar.
   - The patch is available at http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1321350377.1421.55.camel@twins.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to address an issue and has been tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets the queue limits for the admin queue in addition to the I/O queues. This is important because without this helper, the command size on the admin queue is arbitrarily low, which can lead to issues.

2. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function sets various queue limits based on the device-specific parameters stored in the `nvme_ctrl` structure. These limits include the maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush requirements, and virtual boundary. Setting these limits ensures proper functioning and performance of the admin queue.

3. The `nvme_set_queue_limits` function is called in two places: during controller initialization (`nvme_init_identify`) and when allocating a new namespace (`nvme_alloc_ns`). This ensures that the admin queue limits are properly set at the appropriate times.

4. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by, Reported-by, Tested-by, and Reviewed-by tags, indicating that the patch has been reviewed, tested, and approved by relevant individuals.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with the admin queue and improves the stability and performance of the NVMe driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to remove the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 platforms. The reason for this removal is that when the "gpmc_fck" clock is obtained in gpmc.c, it results in misconfigured timings and devices being lost due to divisions by zero.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. By removing the "gpmc_fck" clock from the dummy clocks, gpmc.c can fail gracefully instead of causing misconfigurations and device loss.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch defines a new state called "CONNECTED" for a ceph connection, which represents a fully operational connection. This explicit state definition improves clarity and maintainability.

2. The patch correctly sets the "CONNECTED" state when the connection sequence completes successfully and clears it when the connection is closed.

3. The patch also handles socket disconnect events more carefully by clearing the "CONNECTED" state when a disconnect event is reported.

4. The patch includes necessary changes in the "ceph_con_close" function to clear the "CONNECTED" state when closing a connection.

5. The patch includes changes in the "process_connect" function to set the "CONNECTED" state when a connection is successfully established.

6. The patch includes changes in the "try_read" function to clear the "CONNECTED" state when a close message is received.

7. The patch includes changes in the "con_work" function to handle the "CONNECTED" state correctly when a socket is closed.

Overall, the patch introduces a new explicit state, handles the state transitions correctly, and ensures proper handling of socket disconnect events. These changes improve the reliability and stability of the ceph connection handling. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to address a potential crash in the gs_start_tx() function of the usb gadget serial driver. The patch adds a check for the 'port->port_usb' pointer before accessing it to avoid the crash.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential crash and improves the stability of the usb gadget serial driver.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses a Coverity report that highlights a suspicious allocation size in the `devm_watchdog_register_device` function. The patch fixes the allocation size by changing `sizeof(*wdd)` to `sizeof(*rcwdd)`, which is the correct size for the allocation.

Additionally, the patch includes the necessary Fixes tag, indicating that it resolves a specific issue introduced in a previous commit. It also includes the Acked-by tag from a recognized contributor, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved.

Therefore, considering the fix and the appropriate tags, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of the in_irq() function in the intel_check_page_flip() function in the intel_display.c file of the i915 DRM driver.

2. The in_irq() function only tests for hard-IRQ context, which can lead to warnings when the system is run with the 'threadirqs' option selected. This is because the intel_check_page_flip() function can be called in soft-IRQ context, causing the warnings.

3. The proposed solution is to replace in_irq() with in_interrupt(). The in_interrupt() function allows for either type of interrupt context and still detects and complains about misuse of the page flip code if it is ever called from non-interrupt context.

4. The patch includes a reference to a Bugzilla entry (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89321) that provides additional context and information about the issue.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Dave Gordon and Daniel Vetter, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

6. The patch is also marked for inclusion in the stable branch (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), suggesting that it is considered important for maintaining stability in the Linux kernel.

Based on these points, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue, provides a suitable solution, and has undergone review and testing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in the drm/radeon/dpm and drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/rv770_dpm.c files. It replaces the manual lookup of the max_vddc value with the use of a stored value.

In both files, the patch checks if the vddc value is set to 0xff01. If it is, instead of calling radeon_atom_get_max_vddc to look up the value, it uses the stored max_vddc value from the power_info structure (pi->max_vddc).

This change improves efficiency by avoiding the repeated lookup of the max_vddc value and instead using the stored value directly.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable optimization that improves performance without introducing any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is reverting a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been shown to be unreliable, causing the device to not wake up for important events.

Given this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch addresses a known issue and reverts the changes that caused the problem. By reverting the commit, the stability of the Bluetooth functionality for Intel devices can be restored.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the length calculation of Tx statistics in ethtool stats for qlcnic drivers.
2. It considers the number of Tx queues while calculating the length of Tx statistics.
3. It calculates the statistics length properly for both 82xx and 83xx adapters.
4. The patch includes changes to the qlcnic_82xx_statistics and qlcnic_83xx_statistics functions to calculate the length correctly.
5. The qlcnic_dev_statistics_len function is modified to handle both 82xx and 83xx adapters and return the correct length.
6. The patch also fixes the qlcnic_get_sset_count function to return the correct statistics length.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug in the length calculation of Tx statistics and ensures that the length is calculated correctly for both 82xx and 83xx adapters. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the intention is to correct a logic error in the original implementation related to disabling clocks for the MMC hardware block. The patch suggests changing the logic from disabling the clock to enabling it instead.

In terms of stability, it is generally not recommended to leave clocks running when they are not needed, as it can consume unnecessary power and potentially cause issues. Therefore, the proposed change to enable the clock seems reasonable.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to fix an issue with the rtnl_calcit() function in the RT netlink code. The patch ensures that the minimal size for the netlink dump message includes the size of the netlink message header.

Considering the importance of accurate size calculation for netlink dump messages, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, to make a more informed decision, it would be helpful to review the code changes in more detail and consider any potential side effects or regressions that the patch may introduce.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to clear the PLC (Port Link Change) for USB2 root hub ports when the link state changes.
2. Currently, xHC (xHCI host controller) reports a port status change event and sets the PORT_PLC bit for both USB3 and USB2 root hub ports.
3. However, the PLC is cleared by usbcore for USB3 root hub ports but not for USB2 ports because they do not report USB_PORT_STAT_C_LINK_STATE in wPortChange.
4. The patch adds a check to clear the PLC for USB2 root hub ports in the handle_port_status() function.
5. The condition checks if the host controller driver's speed is not HCD_USB3 (indicating USB2) and then clears the PORT_PLC bit using the xhci_test_and_clear_bit() function.
6. Finally, the patch includes the necessary cleanup and updates the event ring dequeue pointer.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses the issue of not clearing the PLC for USB2 root hub ports when the link state changes, ensuring consistent behavior across USB3 and USB2 root hub ports.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more comprehensive analysis would require considering the broader context and potential implications on system stability and performance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a possible NULL pointer dereference issue introduced in commit 219580e.
2. The issue occurs when the function `wait_event_interruptible` is called before `functionfs_bind()`, and `epfile->ffs->gadget` is still NULL.
3. The patch resolves the issue by moving the assignment of `epfile->ffs->gadget` to the local `gadget` variable after the waiting has completed.
4. The patch includes the necessary `Signed-off-by` and `Acked-by` tags.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a potential bug and has the appropriate sign-offs, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a connector quirk for a specific board, the Fujitsu D3003-S2.
2. The patch addresses a bug reported in the bug tracker (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83184).
3. The patch is signed-off by Alex Deucher, who is a recognized contributor to the Linux kernel.
4. The patch includes the necessary Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it is suitable for stable releases.
5. The code change itself adds a condition to check if the device is the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board with a specific subsystem vendor and device ID. If the connector type is VGA, the function returns false, indicating that the connector should not be considered for this board.
6. The change appears to be specific to a particular hardware configuration and does not affect other devices.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the reported bug and improve compatibility with the Fujitsu D3003-S2 board.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward fix for renaming the function `dev_hw_addr_random()` to `eth_hw_addr_random()` in the `lpc_eth.c` driver. This change ensures consistency with the integration of `lpc_eth.c` and resolves any potential issues caused by the function name mismatch.

Considering the patch's simplicity and the fact that it addresses a specific issue, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to inject a #GP (General Protection) exception when a guest sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value. This is a necessary check to ensure the guest does not set an unsupported or incorrect value.

2. The patch modifies the `vmx_set_msr` function in `arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c`. It adds a check using the `kvm_mtrr_valid` function to verify the validity of the MSR_IA32_CR_PAT (PAT CR) value before writing it to the guest's IA32_PAT MSR.

3. The `kvm_mtrr_valid` function is defined in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c`. It performs checks on the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values to ensure they are valid. This function is also exported for use in other parts of the code.

4. The `set_msr_mtrr` function in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.c` is modified to use `kvm_mtrr_valid` instead of the previous `mtrr_valid` function. This ensures that the MTRR values are checked for validity before being set.

5. The `kvm_mtrr_valid` function is also declared in `arch/x86/kvm/x86.h` to make it accessible to other files.

Overall, the patch adds necessary checks to ensure that the guest's PAT CR and MTRR values are valid. It improves the stability and security of the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

6. The patch modifies the ath9k_ps_restore() function in the drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/main.c file.
7. The patch correctly handles the PS_WAIT_FOR_TX_ACK flag and ensures that the hardware only goes to full sleep if no transmission is pending.
8. The patch also handles other PS flags appropriately to determine the sleep mode.

Based on these points, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and has been reviewed and approved by the author. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The h5_reset_rx() function frees the Rx skb (socket buffer) when detecting a non-link packet. However, not returning after that can cause a kernel oops when the upcoming h5_rx_payload() function dereferences the now NULL Rx skb.

2. The patch adds a return statement after calling h5_reset_rx(h5), which prevents the subsequent dereference of a NULL Rx skb and avoids triggering a kernel oops.

3. The change is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or behavior. It only adds a return statement to handle the specific case mentioned above.

4. The patch has been signed-off by Loic Poulain and Marcel Holtmann, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the change.

5. The patch includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is intended for inclusion in the stable kernel releases.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the mentioned issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `sound/core/pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only a few bytes smaller than expected and hdelta is just slightly larger than half a buffer time (e.g., in a ping-pong buffer). In such cases, the current implementation incorrectly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

To fix this, the patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that even if hdelta is slightly larger than half a buffer time, it won't be considered as a double acknowledged interrupt.

The patch also mentions that jiffies, which is used for hdelta calculation, is not high resolution and may have inaccuracies. This is an important consideration for the condition.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific scenario and improves the accuracy of detecting double acknowledged interrupts. It also takes into account the limitations of jiffies. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata by using the real length of the data instead of the padded length. This bug is a deviation from the specification and needs to be addressed.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it is fine to include it in the patch.

3. The patch removes the usage of magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by the commit mentioned.

5. The patch has been signed-off by the relevant contributors, indicating their approval and responsibility for the changes.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the removal of code that set lpm_capable for USB 3.0 super-speed root hub. The intention of the previous change was to avoid touching internal fields and let the USB core handle it, but it resulted in lpm_capable not being set for the root hub.

2. The patch adds code to check and set lpm_capable when registering a root hub device, ensuring that lpm is functional in the Linux kernel.

3. The patch can be back-ported to kernels as old as v3.15, which indicates that it is suitable for stable releases.

4. The patch has been Acked-by Alan Stern, which suggests that it has undergone review and received approval from a trusted source.

Considering these points, it appears that the patch addresses a functional issue and has received positive feedback, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current implementation counts all interrupts as false ones when there is nothing the driver can do with them. However, there may be cases where a SCI EC interrupt is fired during normal read/write operations, which should not be considered false. The patch aims to fix this problem.

2. The patch includes proper documentation: The code changes are accompanied by comments explaining the rationale behind the modifications. This helps in understanding the intention of the code and the impact of the changes.

3. The patch introduces a condition to differentiate false interrupts: The patch adds a condition to check if the SCI bit is set in the status variable. If the SCI bit is set, the interrupt is not considered false, and the IRQ count is not incremented. This ensures that only relevant interrupts are counted.

4. The patch maintains backward compatibility: The changes made in the patch do not affect the existing behavior when the SCI bit is not set. It only modifies the behavior when the SCI bit is set, preventing false interrupts from being counted.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be well-implemented and addresses a specific issue without introducing any regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the calculate_imbalance() function in the sched/balancing module. The bug occurs when the local average load is greater than or equal to the busiest average load, which is also greater than or equal to the sds average load. In this case, there is a potential for imbalance overflow, leading to constant task bouncing between CPUs, especially when there are pinned tasks.

The patch fixes this issue by skipping the assignment and assuming imbalance=0 when local->avg_load is greater than or equal to sds->avg_load. This prevents the imbalance overflow and resolves the task bouncing problem.

The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the original author, Vladimir Davydov, and the co-author, Peter Zijlstra. It also includes a link to the original discussion thread on the LKML mailing list.

Additionally, the patch has been reviewed and signed-off-by Ingo Molnar, a well-known kernel developer.

Considering the bug fix and the proper sign-off process, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch aims to extend the support for Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) to all variants of RGMII interfaces. This is done by allowing EEE for all PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII modes, including those with transmit or receive internal delay, no delays at all, or delays in both directions.

2. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit (a59a4d192166).

3. The patch has been signed-off by Florian Fainelli <f.fainelli@gmail.com> and David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant individuals.

3. The patch has been signed-off by Ping Cheng and Jiri Kosina, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.
4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the "wacom_wac.c" file, specifically in the "wacom_intuos_inout" and "wacom_bpt_pen" functions.
5. The changes do not appear to introduce any new issues or regressions.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to improve the behavior of tablets that support both pen and touch input.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit (abfb7b686a3e) related to FDT manipulation after the invocation of ExitBootServices() in AArch64 UEFI implementations.

2. The patch fixes the issue by moving the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that FDT manipulation occurs in a more appropriate place and avoids potential alignment faults when the MMU is disabled.

3. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag referencing the commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear indication of its purpose.

4. It has been tested and verified by Riku Voipio.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. In the `mixer_enable_vblank` function, the patch replaces the line:
   ```
   mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_EN, MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC, MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC);
   ```
   with:
   ```
   mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_STATUS, ~0, MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC);
   mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_EN, ~0, MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC);
   ```
   This change clears the vsync indicator before configuring vsync.

2. In the `mixer_disable_vblank` function, the patch adds the line:
   ```
   mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_STATUS, ~0, MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC);
   ```
   This line clears the vsync indicator before disabling the vsync interrupt.

3. In the `mixer_enable` function, the patch adds the following condition:
   ```
   if (ctx->int_en & MXR_INT_EN_VSYNC)
       mixer_reg_writemask(res, MXR_INT_STATUS, ~0, MXR_INT_CLEAR_VSYNC);
   ```
   This condition clears the vsync indicator if the vsync interrupt is enabled.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch addresses the issue of clearing the vsync indicator before configuring or disabling the vsync interrupt. This is in line with the specification's advice.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (A) in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the erasure of a node from the sidr_id_node rb-tree in the cm_destroy_id() and ib_send_cm_sidr_rep() functions.

3. The fix ensures that the cm_id_priv node is erased only once before freeing cm_id_priv.

4. The patch includes a "Fixes" tag, which references the commit that introduced the issue, providing a clear indication of the problem being addressed.

5. The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, indicating their agreement with the fix.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a clear fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the SPARC64 architecture, where the maximum number of CPUs (NR_CPUS) is limited to 4064 instead of 4096 due to memory allocation constraints.

2. The patch proposes a fix by allocating the required number of pages based on the size of the cpu_list for possible CPUs. It ensures that the allocated pages are aligned properly and does not break any imm13 offsets from the base physical address.

3. The patch includes a bug reference (Orabug: 25505750) and is signed-off by the author and reviewed by other contributors, indicating that it has gone through a review process.

4. The changes are specific to the SPARC architecture and do not affect other platforms.

5. The code modifications in the patch appear to be correct and address the issue without introducing any new potential problems.

Based on these factors, I believe the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the btrfs file system where the fs_info->pending_changes variable is not properly cleared. The original code uses cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0), which only clears the variable if it is already 0. This can cause problems when mounting btrfs with the inode_cache mount option, as the pending_changes variable will always be 1, even when the file system is frozen.

The patch modifies the code to use xchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0), which ensures that the variable is always cleared, regardless of its previous value. This fix resolves the issue and prevents potential problems when using the inode_cache mount option.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Qu Wenruo, David Sterba, and Chris Mason. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

Considering the nature of the bug and the provided fix, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to ensure the stability and reliability of the btrfs file system.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is modifying the `hwmon_attributes_visible` function in the `amdgpu_pm.c` file of the AMDGPU driver. The purpose of the patch is to prevent the creation of certain sysfs nodes related to PWM fan control if DPM (Dynamic Power Management) is disabled.

The patch adds a check to skip the creation of PWM-related attributes if DPM is not enabled. This is important because PWM fan control is only available with DPM, and there is no non-DPM support in the amdgpu driver. By adding this check, the patch ensures that the sysfs nodes for PWM control are not created when DPM is disabled, preventing any potential crashes or issues.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific scenario and adds a necessary check to avoid potential problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch step-by-step:

1. The patch aims to fix the WARNING "percpu_ref_kill() called more than once!" that occurs during unloading the block driver.

2. The patch removes the call to `blk_mq_freeze_queue(q)` before deleting the tag set. This is because the queue has already been frozen by `blk_cleanup_queue()` before the tag set deletion, so there is no need to freeze it again.

3. The patch also removes the subsequent call to `blk_mq_unfreeze_queue(q)`.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific warning and removing unnecessary code. It does not introduce any new functionality or changes that could potentially cause regressions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where global hardcoded limits were added to the amount of message queues that can be created in the ipc/mqueue subsystem. These limits were causing problems for userspace applications, as they were too low and restrictive. The patch proposes reverting the limits entirely and falling back to the original behavior where new queues cannot be created once a user's resource limit is reached and all memory is used.

The patch includes a signed-off-by statement from the author and has been reported by affected users. It also has an Acked-by statement from a recognized contributor.

The changes in the patch modify the include/linux/ipc_namespace.h and ipc/mq_sysctl.c files. In include/linux/ipc_namespace.h, the MIN_QUEUESMAX and HARD_QUEUESMAX definitions are removed. In ipc/mq_sysctl.c, the proc_mq_dointvec_minmax function is replaced with proc_mq_dointvec, and the extra1 and extra2 fields in the mq_sysctls array are removed.

In ipc/mqueue.c, the mqueue_create function is modified to check if the number of message queues has reached the maximum allowed by the ipc_namespace and if the user has the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability. If the conditions are met, an error is returned.

Overall, the patch addresses a known issue and reverts the limits that were causing problems for users. It has been reviewed and acknowledged by contributors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

However, it is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information. A more thorough review of the patch and its impact on other systems and functionalities would be necessary to make a final determination.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a missing unlock on the error handle path in the `net2272_irq()` function in the `net2272.c` file. The patch aims to add the missing unlock statement before returning `IRQ_NONE` in the case where `intcsr` is zero.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a valid fix for a potential issue. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the memremap's helper function try_ram_remap(). Currently, the function dereferences a struct page pointer derived from a PFN without checking if the PFN is valid. The assumption is that the PFN is covered by a 'System RAM' iomem region and has a struct page associated with it, which is covered by the kernel direct mapping.

However, this assumption may not hold true on all architectures, specifically ARM and arm64, where 'System RAM' may include regions for which pfn_valid() returns false. To ensure correctness, the patch adds a check for pfn_valid() before calling pfn_to_page() in try_ram_remap().

This change ensures that both __va() and pfn_to_page() are only called on PFNs/physical addresses for which pfn_valid() returns true. By adding this check, the patch improves the reliability and compatibility of the code across different architectures.

Considering the patch addresses a potential issue and improves the code's compatibility, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for the MACB/GEM driver in the Linux kernel. The patch aims to initialize the checksum field to 0 in order to ensure correct results on transmit in all cases, specifically addressing an issue with UDP packets on Zynq.

6. In `sw.c`, the patch updates the description of the `int_clear` module parameter to clarify its behavior.
7. The patch is signed-off by the author and the relevant maintainers.
8. The patch is also marked for inclusion in stable releases (Cc: Stable).

Considering the above points, it seems that the patch addresses a known issue and fixes a logic error in the previous patch. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to prevent stacking filesystems (such as ecryptfs and overlayfs) from using procfs as the lower filesystem. The rationale behind this decision is that procfs has a lot of internal complexity and performs access checks in VFS open handlers. Additionally, ecryptfs calls open handlers from a kernel thread that doesn't drop privileges.

The patch modifies the proc_mount function in fs/proc/root.c by setting the s_stack_depth field of the superblock to FILESYSTEM_MAX_STACK_DEPTH. This effectively prevents stacking filesystems on top of procfs.

The change seems reasonable as it provides a clear explanation for why stacking filesystems should not be allowed on procfs. It also adds a comment to clarify the purpose of the code modification.

Given that the patch addresses a potential issue and provides a clear explanation, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue where requests may be lost if a stopped queue restarts before the requests are added to the dispatch list. The patch adds a check to ensure that requests in the rq_list are not lost in such scenarios.

The added code snippet in the patch checks if the queue is stopped and restarted before the requests in rq_list are added to hctx->dispatch. If this happens, the patch calls blk_mq_run_hw_queue() again to dispatch the requests and prevent them from being lost.

This patch improves the reliability of the block layer by ensuring that requests are not lost when a stopped queue restarts. It does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the code to avoid clearing the PID_BUF wrongly in the usbhsf_pio_try_pop() function.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it appears that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is a partial revert of a previous commit that added a cond_resched() call to __collapse_huge_page_copy() function in the mm/khugepaged.c file. The purpose of the cond_resched() call was to allow scheduling during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy().

The patch explains that on x86 with CONFIG_HIGHPTE, __collapse_huge_page_copy() is called in atomic context, where scheduling is not possible. This configuration is only possible on arm and i386 architectures.

The patch argues that although need_resched has been shown to be set for over 100 jiffies during the iteration in __collapse_huge_page_copy(), it is still better than using a generic in_atomic() check to cover non-CONFIG_HIGHPTE configurations.

Based on this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch provides a valid reason for the partial revert and explains the specific scenarios where the cond_resched() call is not necessary. Additionally, it has been Acked by Michal Hocko, which indicates that it has received positive feedback from a trusted source.

However, it is important to note that further review and testing may be required to ensure that the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects or regressions.

4. The patch also includes proper locking mechanisms (spin_unlock_irqrestore) to ensure thread safety.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Linus Torvalds.

Considering these factors, it appears that the patch is a valid bug fix that improves the correctness and reliability of the rtc_irq_set_state() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is porting changes from the x86 page fault handler to the 64-bit sparc page fault handler. These changes make the page fault handler retryable and killable, reducing the mmap_sem hold time during OOM killer invocation.

The patch adds the FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY and FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE flags to the flags variable. These flags are then used when calling handle_mm_fault to handle the page fault. If the fault is retryable and a fatal signal is pending, the function returns without further processing.

If the fault is not retryable, the patch checks for VM_FAULT_ERROR. If the fault is an OOM fault, it jumps to the out_of_memory label. If the fault is a SIGBUS fault, it jumps to the do_sigbus label. Otherwise, it triggers a BUG.

If the fault is retryable, the patch updates the maj_flt and min_flt counters accordingly and then checks if the fault is also retryable. If it is, the FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY flag is cleared, and the function jumps to the retry label, effectively retrying the fault.

Finally, the patch releases the mmap_sem lock before returning.

Overall, the patch seems to correctly port the changes from the x86 page fault handler to the sparc page fault handler, making it retryable and killable. It also handles OOM and SIGBUS faults appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The current vfio-pci code incorrectly checks the device type using the PCI_HEADER_TYPE value, which is used as an offset in the configuration space. However, the correct approach is to directly check the pci_dev->hdr_type value.

2. The patch fixes the issue by modifying the check to use pdev->hdr_type instead of the incorrect type value obtained from pci_read_config_byte.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch also includes a Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch correctly addresses a bug and has been reviewed and tested. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch is reverting a previous commit, specifically commit 773875bfb6737982903c42d1ee88cf60af80089c. The reason for the revert is mentioned as the lack of dithering reported by a large number of people with various gen2/3 hardware.

The original patch is described as complete nonsense since the backtraces in the referenced bugzilla are about gmch_pfit.lvds_border_bits mismatch, not related to the dither bit.

Looking at the code changes, the patch modifies the `intel_lvds_get_config` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_lvds.c` and the `intel_gmch_panel_fitting` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_panel.c`.

In `intel_lvds_get_config`, the patch adds code to set the `PANEL_8TO6_DITHER_ENABLE` flag in `pipe_config->gmch_pfit.control` if the hardware generation is less than 4 (gen2/3).

In `intel_gmch_panel_fitting`, the patch adds code to set the `PANEL_8TO6_DITHER_ENABLE` flag in `pfit_control` if the hardware generation is less than 4 and the `pipe_config->pipe_bpp` is 18.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a reported issue related to dithering on gen2/3 hardware. The revert is being done because the original patch was not addressing the correct issue.

Considering the importance of dithering and the reported issues, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) to ensure proper functionality on gen2/3 hardware.

ACK
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the vgic-v3.c file in the virt/kvm/arm/vgic directory. It addresses an issue related to level interrupts in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures.

The patch introduces changes to the vgic_v3_fold_lr_state() function. Previously, when reading back from the list registers, two actions were performed for level interrupts: clearing the soft-pending bit if the interrupt is no longer pending in the list register and resampling the line level to propagate it to the pending state.

However, the patch suggests that these two actions should not be linked, and the line level should always be resampled, regardless of the state in the list register. This is important to avoid injecting spurious interrupts that have already been retired.

The modified code now checks if the interrupt configuration is VGIC_CONFIG_LEVEL. If it is, the patch first checks if the interrupt is no longer pending in the list register. If it is not pending, the soft_pending flag is cleared. Then, the patch updates the pending state by considering both the line level and the soft_pending flag.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue related to level interrupts and ensures that the line level is always resampled. It does not introduce any obvious regressions or potential issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the changes are removing redundant code that checks the resource using `platform_get_resource` before calling `devm_ioremap_resource`. The patch removes these redundant checks and directly calls `devm_ioremap_resource` without checking the resource.

In general, removing redundant code is a good practice as it improves code readability and maintainability. However, it is important to ensure that the removed checks are not necessary for proper functioning of the driver.

In this case, since `devm_ioremap_resource` already performs sanity checks on the given resource, it is reasonable to remove the redundant checks. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch aims to convert the "ffs" macro in the CRIS architecture to a function-like macro. This conversion is necessary to avoid conflicts with code that uses identifiers called "ffs."

The patch resolves compilation errors and warnings related to the undeclared "ffsusb_func" identifier and the unused variable "kernel_ffsusb_func." It also addresses the warning about control reaching the end of a non-void function.

Considering the patch's purpose of resolving compilation issues and improving code consistency, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to restarting the device. It explains that when the device is restarted, all the Rx/Tx Block Ack sessions are wiped out by the driver. Therefore, the patch suggests ignoring requests from mac80211 that stop Tx aggregation while reconfiguring the device.

2. The patch includes a comment explaining that stopping a non-existing Rx BA session is harmless, so it suggests honoring mac80211's request.

3. The patch is signed-off by two developers from Intel, Emmanuel Grumbach and Johannes Berg, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The code changes in the patch are minimal and focused on handling the specific scenario of restarting the device.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the issue related to device restarts.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is addressing a potential issue of invalid memory access in the zram sysfs handler. The patch adds a lock to protect access to zram->meta, ensuring that it is not accessed after being freed by zram_reset_device().

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential bug and improves the stability and reliability of the zram module. Additionally, it has already been Acked by Minchan Kim and has the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list in the Cc field, indicating that it has undergone some review.

However, please note that my analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch and may not take into account any specific requirements or considerations of the Linux -stable releases. It is always recommended to consult with the Linux kernel maintainers and follow their guidelines for patch acceptance.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch modifies the `usbnet_stop` function in the `usbnet.c` file. It introduces a new variable `mpn` and assigns it the negation of the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit in `dev->flags`. This change ensures that the value of `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` is read before it is cleared.

The patch then modifies the conditional statement that checks whether to call `info->manage_power` or `usb_autopm_put_interface`. Instead of directly checking the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit, it now checks the value of `mpn`.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a potential issue with reading the `EVENT_NO_RUNTIME_PM` bit before it is cleared. The change ensures that the correct value is used in the conditional statement.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

This resulted in inappropriate zone congestion clearing during higher order reclaims, which affected the reclaim throttling logic for zones with dirty/writeback pages.

The proposed solution is to remove the clearing from the zone compaction section entirely. The preliminary zone check and the reclaim loop in kswapd will clear the congestion flag if the zone is considered balanced.

This patch ensures that zone congestion status is only cleared when the watermarks have been restored, which aligns with the intended behavior. It fixes the issue without introducing any new problems.

The patch has been reviewed by Johannes Weiner and Rik van Riel, and it is also signed-off by Linus Torvalds.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The issue was triggered on a KVM virtual machine that uses IRQ9 for SCI in high-level mode and defines a PCI interrupt link device (LNKS) with IRQ9 as the only possible IRQ. This causes an interrupt storm when enabling the PCI device because PCI IRQ works in low-level mode.

3. The patch modifies the acpi_isa_register_gsi() function in drivers/acpi/pci_irq.c to check if the IRQ is available and not occupied by an ISA IRQ before using it.

4. The patch also modifies the acpi_pci_link_allocate() function in drivers/acpi/pci_link.c to check if the IRQ has a penalty level greater than or equal to PIRQ_PENALTY_ISA_ALWAYS. If so, it prints an error message and returns -ENODEV.

5. The patch introduces a new function, acpi_isa_irq_available(), in include/linux/acpi.h to check if an IRQ is available and not penalized as ISA_ALWAYS.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch modifies the CPU hotplug code for the powernv platform.
2. Currently, offline CPUs are only put into nap mode if the powersave_nap variable is set.
3. However, HV-style KVM on this platform requires secondary CPU threads to be offline and in nap mode.
4. The patch ensures that offline CPUs are always put into nap mode, regardless of powersave_nap.
5. It is mentioned that nap mode works fine on all POWER7 machines, and since the powernv platform only supports POWER7 machines, this change is considered safe.
6. The powersave_nap variable still controls whether or not CPUs go into nap mode when idle, as before.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific requirement for the powernv platform and ensures compatibility with HV-style KVM. It does not introduce any major risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch is fixing a copy-paste bug in the virtio-pci driver.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Problem description: The patch addresses a situation where association restarts do not consider the state of the socket. This can lead to a condition where a remote system creates a local association that is not reachable by the user.

2. Solution: The patch moves the newly established association into the SHUTDOWN-SENT state and includes a SHUTDOWN after the COOKIE-ACK chunk. This ensures that the restarted association immediately enters the shutdown procedure and terminates the unreachable association.

3. Reported-by and Signed-off-by: The patch includes the reported-by and signed-off-by information, indicating that the issue was reported by David Laight and the patch was reviewed and approved by Vlad Yasevich and David S. Miller.

4. Code changes: The patch modifies the sctp_sm_statefuns.c file by adding additional commands to handle the specific scenario. It checks if the association is in the SHUTDOWN_PENDING state and if the socket has been closed by the user. If so, it triggers a SHUTDOWN bundled with COOKIE_ACK instead of transitioning to the ESTABLISHED state.

5. Impact: The patch addresses a specific scenario where an association can become unreachable. It does not introduce any new functionality or affect existing behavior.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the reported issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The commit 8eba0eefae24953962067 removed the trigger configuration when requesting an IRQ, assuming that the interrupt trigger is already properly configured. However, this assumption may not be safe, as some boards disable all interrupt triggers on boot.

2. The patch fixes the issue: It forces the IRQ to trigger on a rising edge, which is also the default for the chip. This ensures that the IRQ trigger is properly configured, even on boards where all interrupt triggers are disabled.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs: It is signed-off by Phoebe Buckheister and David S. Miller, indicating that the authors have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch is concise and focused: It only modifies the necessary code to fix the issue, without introducing any unrelated changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned issue and does not introduce any potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() function in the intel_pstate.c file. The function currently calls intel_pstate_update_perf_limits(), which can cause global P-state limits to change. However, in passive mode, these global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor and are not taken into account by governors when making decisions. This behavior can be confusing and unnecessary.

The patch resolves this issue by removing the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(). This change ensures that the global attributes in sysfs do not change when they have not been written to, aligning with user expectations. Additionally, this change reduces the code size by a few lines.

The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. Since the patch removes the only piece of code updating the per-CPU limits in passive mode, the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account, as expected.

Considering the provided information, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and does not introduce any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes an issue with enum control accesses in the wm8994 codec driver. The DRC Mode and EQ Mode are enum controls, but the current driver incorrectly accesses them using `value.integer.value[]` instead of `value.enumerated.item[]`.

2. The patch correctly updates the code to use `value.enumerated.item[]` for accessing the enum controls.

3. The patch is signed-off by Takashi Iwai and Mark Brown, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The patch includes the appropriate Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list and the relevant file (sound/soc/codecs/wm8994.c).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in MCG paravirtualization is performed in a work queue, which can lead to a race condition. If a ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) leaves and re-joins groups before the cleanup occurs, the cleanup may prune the newly-joined MCGs, leaving the ULP without the actual MCGs while believing it joined them.

To fix this issue, the patch sets the flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clears it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup task is not executed while the ULP is re-joining groups.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, indicating that it has undergone thorough scrutiny. It also includes a clear explanation of the problem and the solution.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch proposes a fix by changing the order of operations in the migration_success_pre_commit() and migration_success_post_commit() functions. Specifically, it suggests calling clear_dirty() before cell_defer() to ensure that the block's dirty status is properly cleared before any new write bios are processed.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential data integrity problem and has been reviewed and acknowledged by other developers.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and it is always advisable to thoroughly test patches before applying them to production systems.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the vhost/scsi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch checks if byte 0 of the virtio-scsi LUN structure is set to '1', as required by the virtio specification. If it is not set to '1', the patch sends a bad target response.

Considering that this patch fixes a compliance issue with the virtio specification, it is likely that it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. However, to make a final decision, it would be necessary to consider additional factors such as the impact of the bug, the stability of the patch, and any potential regressions it may introduce.

2. The patch introduces two new functions, `mvneta_percpu_enable` and `mvneta_percpu_disable`, which respectively enable and disable percpu interrupts for the time when TXQs and RXQs are reconfigured.

3. In the `mvneta_change_mtu` function, before stopping the device, the patch calls `mvneta_percpu_disable` to disable percpu interrupts.

4. After cleaning up TXQs and RXQs, the patch calls `mvneta_percpu_enable` to re-enable percpu interrupts before starting the device and bringing the port up.

5. The patch also includes a separate function `mvneta_mdio_remove`, which is unrelated to the main issue being addressed.

Overall, the patch appears to correctly address the issue by disabling percpu interrupts during the reconfiguration of TXQs and RXQs, ensuring that changing MTU does not block interrupts and prevent data transmission. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, to lock access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree.
2. The resource tree is modified by other patches in the series, which can happen on multiple threads.
3. The patch adds a call to `down(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` before iterating over the `hyperv_mmio` tree, indicating that access to the tree is now protected by the semaphore.
4. If a suitable resource is found, the patch sets `retval` to 0 and jumps to the `exit` label, where the semaphore is released using `up(&hyperv_mmio_lock)`.
5. If no suitable resource is found, `retval` remains -ENXIO, and the semaphore is still released at the `exit` label.
6. The function `vmbus_allocate_mmio` returns `retval` after releasing the semaphore.

Overall, the patch introduces locking to ensure thread safety when modifying the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. It appears to be a necessary change to support other patches in the series that modify the tree. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a regression that occurred in Linux 3.18+ related to the treatment of drm_vblank_offdelay in the drm_vblank_on() function. The issue was that if the user specified a value of zero, which should always re-enable vblank interrupts, a kms driver could override this choice by setting vblank_disable_immediate to true.

The patch fixes this regression and ensures that the user remains in control. It modifies the condition in the drm_vblank_on() function to re-enable vblank interrupts if there are clients left or if the user requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Mario Kleiner and Daniel Vetter. It also includes relevant Cc's and a stable tag.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the regression and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The reason for the reversion is that the backlight code lacks proper locking, which can lead to race conditions. The author suggests that until these races are fixed, further hacks should not be attempted.

Considering this, it is likely that the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it addresses a known issue with the backlight code and avoids potential race conditions. However, it is important to note that a thorough review of the patch and its impact on the stability and functionality of the Linux kernel should be conducted before making a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses the issue of callers missing the fact that `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count` needs to be called under RCU lock. By taking the RCU lock inside `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count`, the patch ensures that the function is called safely.

2. The patch modifies the locking comment to reflect the change in locking behavior. It clarifies that the function now takes `rcu_read_lock()`.

3. The patch handles the case where `find_device_opp` returns an error by setting the `count` variable to the error value and logging an error message. It then releases the RCU lock and returns the error count.

4. The patch uses `list_for_each_entry_rcu` to iterate over the `opp_list` and increments the `count` for each available OPP.

5. Finally, the patch releases the RCU lock before returning the `count`.

Overall, the patch correctly addresses the missing RCU lock issue and ensures that `dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count` is called safely. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a lock-inversion problem in the xHCI driver. The issue is related to the use of spin_lock() instead of spin_lock_irqsave() in the xhci_irq() function. The lockdep warning indicates a possible irq lock inversion dependency.

The patch addresses an issue with looped skbs triggering a WARN_ON_ONCE(delta < len) in skb_try_coalesce() using syzkaller and a filter attached to a TCP socket over the loopback interface. The problem is that tcp_trim_head() can produce an skb with an underestimated truesize for looped skbs.

The patch modifies the __pskb_trim_head() function to return the number of bytes trimmed from skb->head. Previously, the function had a void return type, but now it returns an integer. This change allows tcp_trim_head() to capture the delta_truesize value.

In tcp_trim_head(), the delta_truesize value is calculated by calling __pskb_trim_head() with the skb and len arguments. If delta_truesize is non-zero, it means that skb->truesize needs to be adjusted. The patch then updates skb->truesize, sk->sk_wmem_queued, and performs other necessary adjustments.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a solution without introducing any apparent regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch disables PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. This is because using the default PM Domain with PM_CLK prevents the registration of the real Clock Domain from DT later.

2. The patch replaces explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT. This simplifies the platform logic for most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms.

3. Backwards compatibility with old DTs is provided by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

4. The default PM Domain is still needed for various cases, including backwards compatibility with old DTs lacking PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support, and legacy SuperH platforms.

5. The patch has been signed-off by Geert Uytterhoeven and reviewed by Ulf Hansson.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to address a specific issue related to PM runtime management and provides improvements for multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, the patch in question is reverting a previous commit that fixed a memory leak in the parport driver. The reason for reverting the commit is that the par_dev->state was already being removed in parport_unregister_device().

Considering this information, it seems that the patch is removing the kfree() call for par_dev->state, which was previously freeing the memory allocated for it. This could potentially lead to a memory leak if the memory is not properly freed elsewhere.

Given that the original commit was intended to fix a memory leak and the revert removes the corresponding memory deallocation, it is likely that this patch should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK). The memory leak issue should be addressed in a different way, rather than reverting the original fix.

Please note that a more thorough analysis may be required to make a final decision, but based on the provided information, this is the initial recommendation.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the release of the MMC host after a discard operation.
2. The issue is caused by an invalid check of req->cmd_flags & MMC_REQ_SPECIAL_MASK in the mmc_blk_issue_rq function.
3. The patch fixes the issue by marking the special request down before the discard/flush operation.
4. The patch has been reported by Harold (SoonYeal) Yang and signed-off by Ray Jui.
5. It has also been reviewed and acked by Seungwon Jeon.
6. The patch is also marked for stable release.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is necessary to fix a specific issue and has received appropriate review and approval. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a bug that was exposed by a previous commit, which attempted to fix an oversight related to obj->map_and_fenceable computation.
2. The bug violates the change introduced in the previous patch, which sets map_and_fenceable to true only when the object is bound into the global GTT.
3. The proposed solution in the patch is to unbind from the global GTT if the object is currently fenceable but will not be after the tiling change.
4. The patch includes a Bugzilla reference, a testcase, and has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals, indicating that it has undergone thorough testing and review.
5. The changes in the patch are localized to the i915_gem_tiling.c file, specifically in the i915_gem_set_tiling function.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `mvneta_ioctl` function in the `mvneta.c` file of the Marvell Ethernet driver. The current implementation directly calls `mvneta_adjust_link` after calling `phy_mii_ioctl`. However, `mvneta_adjust_link` is intended to be a callback for `of_phy_connect` and should not be called directly.

The patch removes the direct call to `mvneta_adjust_link` and instead returns the result of `phy_mii_ioctl` directly. This ensures that the callback is properly handled by `of_phy_connect` and avoids any potential issues caused by the direct call.

Overall, the patch improves the code by adhering to the intended usage of the callback function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch addresses a firmware issue in the igb i210 NIC where the firmware may not properly initialize the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register, causing the probe to fail. The patch adds an additional zeroing of this register during igb_get_phy_id to work around the issue.

2. Patch Authorship:
   The patch is signed-off by Chris J Arges, indicating that the author takes responsibility for the changes made. It is also tested by Aaron Brown, providing additional validation.

3. Patch Context:
   The patch modifies the igb_get_phy_id function in the e1000_phy.c file of the igb driver.

4. Patch Changes:
   The patch adds a check for the hardware type (e1000_i210) and if it matches, it writes a value of 0 to the I347AT4_PAGE_SELECT register before reading the PHY ID. This ensures proper initialization of the register and addresses the firmware issue.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to be a valid workaround for the firmware issue and does not introduce any obvious regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the intention is to remove the handling of the AVB-DMAC Receive FIFO Warning interrupt in the ravb driver. The patch removes the code that enables the interrupt by removing the line `ravb_write(ndev, RIC1_RFWE, RIC1);`.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Impact: We need to assess the impact of removing the handling of the AVB-DMAC Receive FIFO Warning interrupt. If this interrupt is not critical for the proper functioning of the driver or the system, then removing its handling may not have any adverse effects.

2. Justification: The patch does not provide any explicit justification for removing the interrupt handling. It is important to understand the reason behind this change to evaluate its necessity.

3. Testing: It is crucial to ensure that the patch has been thoroughly tested to verify that it does not introduce any regressions or issues in the driver's functionality.

Without further information, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, based on the provided information, I would lean towards a NAK (should not be accepted) for this patch. Removing interrupt handling without proper justification or explanation raises concerns about potential negative impacts on the driver's behavior or system stability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to releasing overlays in the OMAPFB driver. The patch ensures that overlays are properly removed from overlay managers, preventing crashes when omapfb is unbound and bound or when the omapfb module is removed and loaded while keeping omapdss around.

Considering the nature of the fix and the potential for crashes, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the dmi_scan function in the firmware/dmi_scan.c file. It fixes the handling of the "End of Table" entry (type 127) in the DMI table. Previously, after adding support for SMBIOS v3, the "End of Table" entry was not being handled correctly, resulting in it not being created in the dmi sysfs.

The patch moves the end-of-table check after it is handled by the dmi_table function, ensuring that the entry is properly created in the dmi sysfs. This is important because the size of the entire DMI table must correspond to the sum of all DMI entry sizes.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Ivan Khoronzhuk and Matt Fleming. It also has a reviewed-by tag from Ard Biesheuvel. The patch is targeted for the v3.19 stable release.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

1. The patch addresses a small race condition between copy_process() and cgroup_attach_task() functions, where child->se.parent,cfs_rq pointers may point to invalid (old) ones.
2. The race condition can lead to a "use-after-free" scenario and potentially cause a panic.
3. The bug has already been observed and caught in RHEL6.4, indicating its impact and importance.
4. The patch includes a detailed explanation of the issue and the steps taken to fix it.
5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Daisuke Nishimura, Peter Zijlstra, and Ingo Molnar.
6. The patch is also marked for stable release consideration, indicating its suitability for inclusion in -stable releases.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch fixes a bug where the "cl->read_cb" pointer is not set to NULL after being released in the "mei_cl_read_start()" function. This can lead to a panic at the "kfree" function in "mei_release()".

The patch correctly sets "cl->read_cb" to NULL after releasing it, ensuring that it does not point to random memory. This prevents potential issues when the client is operated later, such as in "mei_release()".

Considering that this patch fixes a bug that can lead to a panic, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with the error passive level test in the pch_can driver. Currently, the test (((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) > 127) is always false because the receive error counter ((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) is at most 127. The patch suggests using the RP bit (15) to test whether the receive error counter has reached the error passive level.

The changes in the patch are as follows:
- The PCH_RP constant is defined as 0x00008000.
- In the pch_can_error function, the condition for testing the error passive level is changed from (((errc & PCH_REC) >> 8) > 127) to (errc & PCH_RP).

The patch appears to fix the issue by correctly using the RP bit to determine the error passive level. The changes are minimal and targeted, addressing the specific problem without introducing any new risks or side effects.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

2. The patch is intended for the imminent 3.12 release, indicating that it is time-sensitive and should be included in the stable release.

3. The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including David Woodhouse, Brian Norris, Huang Shijie, and Marek Vasut. Their sign-offs indicate that they have reviewed and approved the patch.

4. The patch includes a tested-by tag from Marek Vasut, indicating that the patch has been successfully tested on the specified file.

5. The warning about an unused function is considered harmless and can be addressed at a later stage.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch aims to address an issue with transfer hangs during I2C frame transmission on certain devices. The patch reduces the internal clock frequency of the TWI IP, which resolves the problem without impacting the I2C bus frequency.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, please note that this decision is based solely on the information provided, and a more thorough analysis may be required before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue where the compatible value in some phy nodes confuses the code to differentiate between a PHY and a generic MDIO device.
2. The patch adds a whitelist of PHY compatible strings and issues a warning if a compatible value known on the whitelist is found, indicating that it is a PHY.
3. The patch includes the necessary Fixes, Reported-by, Tested-by, and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals.
4. The changes made in the patch are specific to the "drivers/of/of_mdio.c" file, indicating that it is a targeted fix for a specific module.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue and provides a solution without introducing any potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to information leakage via the getsockname() syscall in the L2CAP code.
2. The problem is identified as the failure to initialize the l2_bdaddr_type member of struct sockaddr_l2 and the padding byte added for alignment.
3. To avoid the information leak, the patch adds an explicit memset(0) before filling the structure.
4. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers, including Mathias Krause, David S. Miller, and others, indicating their approval and review of the changes.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided fix, it seems appropriate to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the information leakage vulnerability.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix a memory leak issue in the reiserfs file system. The issue occurs when the mount operation fails, leaving the commit workqueue allocated and not freed.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a check to see if the commit workqueue (sbi->commit_wq) is allocated and, if so, destroys it before freeing other resources.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It resolves a memory leak and ensures proper resource cleanup in case of mount failures.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided information, and further testing and review may be necessary before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a regression caused by a previous patch that reverted necessary code (32001d6f) for handling open() -> mmap() -> close() -> dirty pages -> munmap() scenarios. This regression caused issues when the lower file was closed before the dirty pages were written out.

2. Instead of reapplying the reverted code, this patch proposes a better approach to ensure that the lower file is still open when writing out the dirty pages. It calls the necessary function from ecryptfs_release(), where the lower file pointer is locked, just before the lower file is closed.

3. The patch includes a link to the bug report (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1047261) that describes the issue and provides additional context.

4. It is signed-off by Tyler Hicks <tyhicks@canonical.com>, indicating that the patch has been reviewed and approved by the author.

5. It is reported and tested by Artemy Tregubenko <me@arty.name> and tested by Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>, indicating that the patch has undergone testing.

6. The patch includes a small code change that writes out all dirty pages before releasing the lower file, ensuring data integrity.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the regression and improve the handling of dirty pages in the eCryptfs module.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a quirk for Intel BYTCR_RT5640 audio devices on Insyde devices. The patch adds a generic quirk to match on the vendor name "Insyde" to avoid recurring edits for different Insyde devices with the same audio routing.

Considering the purpose of the patch and the fact that it adds support for a specific hardware configuration, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to relax the MTU constraints for vxlan devices without an underlying device. Previously, these devices were limited to an MTU of 1500, which is arbitrary and prevents them from taking advantage of jumbo frames and other benefits.

The patch modifies the `vxlan_change_mtu` function to allow setting larger MTU values for vxlan devices. It introduces the `__vxlan_change_mtu` function, which takes into account the maximum MTU based on IP packet limits and vxlan overhead. If the new MTU exceeds the maximum allowed, it either returns an error or sets the MTU to the maximum value, depending on the `strict` flag.

The patch also updates the `egress_ipv4_tun_info` function, but it doesn't seem relevant to the main purpose of the patch.

Overall, this patch improves the flexibility of vxlan devices by allowing larger MTU values, while still maintaining compatibility with the default MTU of 1500. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a registration failure in the s5p-g2d driver. The failure is caused by the parent field not being set, which is now expected to be set as v4l2_dev. The patch sets the v4l2_dev field to the parent field, which resolves the registration failure.

Considering that the patch fixes a known issue and ensures proper registration of the video device, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to PL2303 devices losing bytes when changing serial settings, even if the settings remain the same.
2. The problem was partially fixed by a previous commit, but it could still be triggered in certain scenarios, such as repeatedly requesting a specific baud rate.
3. The patch compares the encoded settings with the previously used ones before configuring the device, ensuring that unnecessary settings updates are avoided.
4. The patch includes a comment explaining the issue and the reason for the specific filtering.
5. The patch also includes a note about the need for additional checks beyond the tty_termios_hw_change function, as the previously requested baud rate may differ from the one actually used.
6. The patch uses memcpy to store the line settings, ensuring that the correct settings are used for comparison in future updates.

Overall, the patch seems to address a specific issue and provides a solution that avoids unnecessary settings updates, improving the stability of PL2303 devices. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the default value of "ret" in the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function. This issue can cause a driver to return -EOPNOTSUPP during the commit phase of a STP state, triggering a WARN() from switchdev.

2. The patch introduces changes to the dsa_slave_port_attr_set function. It initializes the "ret" variable and adds conditional checks to handle the switchdev attribute SWITCHDEV_ATTR_PORT_STP_STATE appropriately.

3. The patch checks if switchdev_trans_ph_prepare is true, indicating the preparation phase of the transaction. In this case, it checks if the driver supports port_stp_update and sets "ret" to 0 if it does, or -EOPNOTSUPP if it doesn't.

4. If switchdev_trans_ph_prepare is false, indicating the commit phase of the transaction, the patch calls the port_stp_update function of the driver with the appropriate arguments.

5. The patch also includes proper attribution to the individuals who reported, signed-off, and acknowledged the issue.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and introduces necessary changes to handle the STP state update correctly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `bnxt_re_dereg_mr` function in the `ib_verbs.c` file of the `bnxt_re` driver. The purpose of the patch is to fix a potential issue where the host buffers are freed before destroying the Memory Region (MR) in the hardware (HW). This could lead to HW trying to access the freed buffers, potentially causing a host crash.

The patch first calls `bnxt_qplib_free_mrw` to deregister the MR in the firmware (FW) before freeing the fast_reg_page_list. If the deregistration fails, an error message is logged, and the function returns the error code.

Next, the patch checks if the MR has associated pages and if so, frees the fast_reg_page_list and the pages. The `bnxt_qplib_free_fast_reg_page_list` function is called to free the fast_reg_page_list. The `mr->pages` pointer is then set to NULL, indicating that the pages have been freed.

Finally, the patch checks if the MR has an associated ib_umem (InfiniBand user memory) and releases it using the `ib_umem_release` function.

Based on the analysis of the patch, it appears to fix a potential issue related to freeing host buffers before destroying the MR in HW. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a potential issue with list traversal in the powerpc/eeh module. The current implementation uses `list_for_each_entry()`, which is not safe if the EEH devices are removed from their parent PE during iteration. The patch replaces it with `list_for_each_entry_safe()` to ensure safe list traversal.

2. The patch modifies the `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` macro in `arch/powerpc/include/asm/eeh.h` to use `list_for_each_entry_safe()` instead of `list_for_each_entry()`. This ensures that the iteration is safe even if devices are removed.

3. The patch also modifies the `eeh_slot_error_detail()` function in `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c` to use `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` with the added `tmp` parameter. This ensures safe iteration over the EEH devices.

4. Similarly, the `eeh_pe_dev_traverse()` function in `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_pe.c` is modified to use `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` with the added `tmp` parameter for safe iteration.

5. Finally, the `__eeh_pe_state_mark()` function in `arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_pe.c` is modified to use `eeh_pe_for_each_dev()` with the added `tmp` parameter for safe iteration.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential issue with list traversal in the powerpc/eeh module and ensures safe iteration over the EEH devices. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It adds the missing xcopy_pt_cmd->sense_buffer[] required for correctly handling CHECK_CONDITION exceptions within the locally generated XCOPY I/O path. This indicates that the patch is intended to fix a bug or improve functionality.

2. The patch includes updates to target_xcopy_read_source() and target_xcopy_setup_pt_cmd() functions to pass the sense_buffer into transport_init_se_cmd(). This ensures that se_cmd->sense_buffer is correctly set up.

3. The patch includes reported-by and cc fields, indicating that the issue was reported by Thomas Glanzmann and Douglas Gilbert, and they are also included in the communication regarding this patch. This suggests that the issue has been identified and discussed by relevant parties.

4. The patch is signed-off by Nicholas Bellinger, who is associated with the drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c file. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by someone familiar with the codebase.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch is well-documented, addresses a specific issue, and has been reviewed by relevant parties. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to restoring fences after resume and GPU resets in the drm/i915 driver. The bug caused corruption on the display and reference counting issues. The patch adds a new function `i915_gem_restore_fences` and modifies the existing functions `i915_gem_reset` and `i915_gem_load` to call this new function.

Considering the nature of the bug and the fix, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue Description:
The patch addresses a memory access violation issue that occurs when the pch_uart_verify_port() function is called during installation. The driver assumes that this function is not called during installation, but in reality, it is. This leads to a memory access violation when the UART processing acts in DMA mode.

2. Solution:
The patch proposes a solution to allocate the DMA channel whenever pch_uart_verify_port() is called and the channel is not already allocated. It first checks if the use_dma flag is false and then calls pch_request_dma() to allocate the channel. After that, it sets the use_dma flag to true.

3. Patch Details:
The patch modifies the pch_uart_verify_port() function in the pch_uart.c file. It adds an if condition to check if use_dma is false before calling pch_request_dma(). If use_dma is false, it allocates the DMA channel and sets use_dma to true.

4. Sign-off:
The patch is signed-off by Tomoya MORINAGA <tomoya.rohm@gmail.com> and Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>. It is also CC'd to the stable mailing list.

Based on the analysis, it appears that the patch correctly addresses the issue and provides a suitable solution. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch description states that all planes, including primary planes, are now destroyed by the DRM framework. Therefore, the explicit call to `plane->destroy` from the `crtc`'s destroy function is no longer necessary.

The patch removes the call to `omap_crtc->plane->funcs->destroy(omap_crtc->plane)`, which fixes the crash caused by double freeing the plane.

Removing this call does not introduce any new issues or regressions. It simply removes redundant code that is no longer needed.

The patch is also signed-off by Tomi Valkeinen, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I will analyze whether it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases or not.

The patch modifies the rpc_fill_super() function in the net/sunrpc/rpc_pipe.c file. It adds a line of code to set the per-net PipeFS superblock (sn->pipefs_sb) before sending a MOUNT notification for the RPC client.

The purpose of this change is to ensure that the per-net PipeFS superblock is set before the notification callback is executed. This is important because there may be cases where the RPC client is no longer held by anyone except the notification callback, and upon release, the client and its associated dentries need to be destroyed. This requires the per-net PipeFS superblock to be set.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential issue related to the destruction of RPC client dentries and ensures the proper setting of the per-net PipeFS superblock before the notification callback is executed.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a bug related to retrieving the touch_max value in the wacom_sys.c file.

2. The issue is that rep_data is no longer an array, so taking its address when passing it to wacom_get_report() is incorrect.

3. The patch modifies the wacom_get_report() function call by removing the address-of operator (&) before rep_data in the last argument.

4. The change ensures that the correct value is passed to wacom_get_report().

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) because it fixes a bug and does not introduce any new issues.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch. A more thorough review, including testing and consideration of potential side effects, is recommended before final acceptance.
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch addresses an issue where Rx data sometimes drops in non-DMA transfer mode due to an incorrect read complete condition. The proposed fix modifies the code in the pch_spi_handler_sub function.

Upon analyzing the patch, it appears that the patch correctly handles the transfer complete interrupt. It checks if the tx_index is equal to bpw_len and if the rx_index is equal to tx_index. If both conditions are true, it disables interrupts, sets the transfer_complete and transfer_active flags, wakes up the wait queue, and considers the transfer as completed.

If the conditions are not met, it logs an error message but does not perform any other actions.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch correctly addresses the issue by ensuring the read complete condition is properly checked. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the information provided, it seems that the patch fixes a bug in the rtl8821ae driver related to an array size mismatch. The bug causes an undefined behavior warning during compilation, but it is considered benign as the overwritten values are not used. Linus Torvalds has pulled the patch and mentioned that it doesn't seem to affect the build or functionality.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting the patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Although the bug is not critical, it is still preferable to have a clean and correct codebase.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a fix for preventing screen corruption when FBC (Frame Buffer Compression) is used. It has been reviewed and signed-off by relevant individuals from Intel. Additionally, it references specific high-level design (HSD) and bspec (BSID) documents.

Considering these factors, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is addressing a specific issue related to the use of ACCESS_ONCE() macro in the code. The issue is related to stack overflow with CONFIG_KASAN=y and builds with gcc-5. The patch removes the usage of ACCESS_ONCE() and verifies that the object code is improved with gcc-5.3.1.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential stack overflow issue and has been tested with different compilers, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix an issue related to driver removal when the interface is up in the MediaTek Ethernet driver. The patch adds a loop to stop all devices and properly shut down the DMA before removing the module.

Considering the nature of the patch and the problem it addresses, it seems reasonable to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that the patch is modifying the ext4 file system code by replacing the use of `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `truncate_pagecache()` in the `ext4_collapse_range()` function. The patch claims that `truncate_pagecache()` should be used instead because it not only truncates the page cache from the given offset to the end of the file but also removes private COWed (Copy-On-Write) pages from the range.

To make a decision, I would consider the following factors:

1. Correctness: Does the patch accurately address the issue it aims to solve? In this case, it appears that the patch is correctly modifying the code to use `truncate_pagecache()` instead of `truncate_pagecache_range()` for collapsing the range.

2. Performance: Does the patch improve or maintain the performance of the ext4 file system? Since `truncate_pagecache()` is claimed to remove private COWed pages, it might potentially improve performance by reducing unnecessary memory usage.

3. Compatibility: Does the patch introduce any compatibility issues or regressions? It is important to ensure that the patch does not break any existing functionality or introduce new bugs.

Based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch. However, a more thorough analysis, including testing and review by the Linux kernel community, would be necessary to make a final decision.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The driver is calling s3c_hsotg_phy_disable three times instead of once when it is removed. This causes the phy reference counter to go below zero and subsequent module inserts to fail.

2. The patch removes the redundant calls to s3c_hsotg_phy_disable from both s3c_hsotg_remove and s3c_hsotg_udc_stop functions. Since s3c_hsotg_udc_stop is already called after usb_gadget_disconnect, which in turn calls s3c_hsotg_pullup (which already calls s3c_hsotg_phy_disable), there is no need to disable the phy again in s3c_hsotg_remove.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple developers from Samsung, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by them.

4. The patch is also marked for stable releases (Cc: stable), indicating that it is considered important for maintaining stability.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to fix the issue described.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register for KVM/ARM. This is necessary to allow dynamic reconfiguration of trapping on a per-vCPU basis.

2. The patch mimics what KVM/arm64 already does, which is to have a per-vCPU HCR field initialized at setup time.

3. The patch modifies the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_arm.h file by removing the HCR_VIRT_EXCP_MASK definition, which is no longer needed.

4. The patch adds the HYP trapping configuration (hcr) field to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch in the arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_host.h file.

5. The patch also adds the irq_lines field to the struct kvm_vcpu_arch, which is used for interrupt-related information.

6. The patch updates the arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.c file to include the offset of the new VCPU_HCR field.

7. The patch initializes the hcr field of the kvm_vcpu struct to HCR_GUEST_MASK in the kvm_arch_vcpu_setup function in the arch/arm/kvm/guest.c file.

8. The patch modifies the configure_hyp_role macro in the arch/arm/kvm/interrupts_head.S file to load the hcr field from the vcpu struct and configure the HCR register accordingly.

Overall, the patch introduces necessary changes to enable per-vCPU HYP Configuration Register in KVM/ARM, which allows dynamic reconfiguration of trapping. It follows the existing implementation in KVM/arm64 and makes the required modifications in relevant files. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug introduced by commit 2d3cbf8b, which removed the is_task_frozen_enough function and replaced it with a simple frozen call. However, this change broke freezing for a group with stopped tasks, as stopped tasks cannot be frozen. As a result, the group remains in the CGROUP_FREEZING state and never reaches CGROUP_FROZEN.

The patch reintroduces the is_task_frozen_enough function and uses it at the original locations (update_if_frozen and try_to_freeze_cgroup). This function considers stopped tasks as frozen enough, ensuring that both cases are considered when testing frozen tasks.

The patch also includes a testcase to verify the fix, which involves creating a freezer cgroup, stopping a task within it, and checking if the freezer state transitions to FROZEN.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Li Zefan, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch provides a clear explanation of the problem and the solution. It states that the lack of removal of net/ip6t_hashlimit/* entries in hashlimit_proc_net_exit() causes the leak, and proposes to fix it by always removing the IPv4 and IPv6 entries and their parent directories in the netns destroy path.

4. The patch includes the necessary changes to the htable_remove_proc_entry() function to remove the proc entries for both IPv4 and IPv6.

5. The patch also includes the necessary changes to the htable_destroy() function to call htable_remove_proc_entry() before deleting the timer and performing other cleanup tasks.

6. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Sergey Popovich and Pablo Neira Ayuso, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch effectively addresses the issue and provides a proper fix. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes a possible issue in the i2c-sun6-p2wi driver related to the use of snprintf. The current code uses snprintf to copy the platform device name to the adapter name field, which could potentially cause issues if the platform device name contains formatting characters.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the DMA debug API related to handling multiple mappings of the same buffer. The problem was that the debug_dma_mapping_error function was not correctly setting the map_err_type field when multiple mappings existed for a buffer.

The patch resolves this issue by modifying the search algorithm to set MAP_ERR_CHECKED on the first buffer that matches the device and DMA address and is currently in the MAP_ERR_NOT_CHECKED state. This ensures that the map_err_type field is correctly set for all mappings of the buffer.

Additionally, the patch mentions a secondary side effect where only the last mapping will have a valid map_err_type if multiple buffers use the same address. However, this behavior is considered preferable as it reduces the number of false errors reported for multi-mapped buffers.

The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Shuah Khan and Joerg Roedel, and has been signed-off by Alexander Duyck, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the issue being addressed is passing the correct pointer to the `free_irq()` function in the `rtc-pl031.c` driver. The patch correctly modifies the `free_irq()` call to pass `ldata` instead of `ldata->rtc`.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch fixes a potential issue where the incorrect pointer was being passed to `free_irq()`, which could lead to the IRQ not being freed properly. By passing the correct pointer, the patch ensures proper cleanup and avoids potential issues.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the CPU load average increase caused by the SENSE_PORT command in the mlx4_cmd_wait function. Currently, the wait_for_completion_timeout call puts the kernel thread into the uninterruptible state, contributing to the CPU load average. 

The patch suggests using wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout instead, which puts the thread in the interruptible state, preventing it from contributing to the CPU load average. Additionally, in the case of an interrupted wait, the patch treats it as if the SENSE_PORT command returned port_type = NONE.

The fix is suggested by Gideon Naim and Bart Van Assche, and it has been signed-off by multiple contributors, including Jack Morgenstein, Or Gerlitz, and David S. Miller.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a solution that improves the CPU load average behavior. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire kernel codebase is always recommended before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the memory_is_poisoned_16() function in the kasan.c file. The function checks if a 16-byte memory region is poisoned or not. The issue is that the code incorrectly calls memory_is_poisoned_1() even when it is not necessary.

The patch fixes this by checking if the memory is aligned on 8 bytes using the IS_ALIGNED() macro. If it is aligned, there is no need to call memory_is_poisoned_1(), and the function can return false immediately.

This change improves performance by avoiding unnecessary function calls when the memory is aligned. It also ensures that the last byte of the memory region is not mistakenly checked when it is not required.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Andrey Ryabinin, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by a trusted developer.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

It explains that when reading multiple registers, the received buffer of 16-byte words is little endian, which can cause incorrect values for step count and activity on big endian machines. The patch resolves this issue by using a buffer of u16 type instead of u32 type, ensuring correct order of values.

3. The patch includes a "Reported-by" tag, indicating that the issue was reported by a user, and a "Signed-off-by" tag from the patch author and the maintainer, which adds credibility to the patch.

4. The changes made in the patch are localized to the specific function `mma9553_read_activity_stepcnt`, and they do not seem to introduce any new risks or regressions.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the endianness issue and code refactoring, and it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is described as a clean-up, indicating that it aims to improve the code without introducing any functional changes.

2. The change in the rt6_clean_expires() function is a NOP (No Operation) in terms of functionality. It does not alter the behavior of the code.

3. The semantic change in the function is to set rt->dst.from to NULL instead of rt->dst.expires = 0. This change ensures that the RTF_EXPIRES flag is cleared correctly, treating the union as a pointer (dst.from) rather than a long (dst.expires).

4. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a safe and beneficial improvement to the code, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Patch Description:
   The patch addresses a situation where the reconstruction of the BIOS framebuffer fails, resulting in a mismatch between the plane state and the primary plane's visibility. This mismatch can cause issues later on, particularly with the watermark code. The proposed solution is to disable the primary plane and treat it as if it was never enabled by the BIOS.

2. Changes Made:
   The patch adds a call to `intel_pre_disable_primary()` and disables the primary plane by setting its visibility to false. It also updates the plane mask and calls `disable_plane()` to disable the primary plane.

3. Justification:
   By disabling the primary plane when the reconstruction of the BIOS framebuffer fails, the patch ensures that the plane state remains consistent and avoids potential issues with the watermark code. Disabling the primary plane is a reasonable solution in this scenario, as it prevents any further problems caused by the mismatched state.

true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an integer overflow issue in the ELF_ET_DYN_BASE calculation. The current calculation overflows on 32-bit platforms, causing incorrect values for ELF_ET_DYN_BASE.

2. The patch fixes the overflow issue by dividing TASK_SIZE before multiplying, ensuring that the calculation does not overflow.

3. The patch is necessary for AddressSanitizer (ASan) to work correctly with Position Independent Executable (PIE) binaries when ASLR is disabled. Without this patch, ASan fails to map shadow memory for PIE binaries when ASLR is disabled.

4. The patch also takes into account Kees's 'split ET_DYN ASLR from mmap ASLR' patchset, which increases the chance of PIE binaries loading between 0x2a000000 and 0x40000000, even with ASLR enabled. This makes ASan with PIE binaries incompatible without the patch.

5. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Andrey Ryabinin and reported by Maria Guseva. It also includes the necessary Cc to the stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list.

6. The patch is relatively small and does not introduce any new functionality or major changes. It only fixes a specific issue related to ELF_ET_DYN_BASE calculation.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue in the tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() functions, where the use count of md5sig_pool is incorrectly increased for each tcp md5sig peer. This can lead to incorrect assumptions in tcp_v4_clear_md5_list().

2. The patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to only increase the use count of md5sig_pool for the first tcp md5sig peer. This ensures that the use count is correctly managed.

3. The patch also adds checks to tcp_v4_md5_do_add() and tcp_v6_md5_do_add() to prevent memory allocation failures when the entries4 and entries6 fields of md5sig_info are zero. If memory allocation fails, the patch frees the newkey and calls tcp_free_md5sig_pool() only if entries4 or entries6 are zero.

4. Similarly, the patch modifies tcp_v4_md5_do_del() and tcp_v6_md5_do_del() to call tcp_free_md5sig_pool() only if entries4 or entries6 are zero. This ensures that the md5sig_pool is freed correctly.

Overall, the patch fixes the incorrect handling of md5sig_pool references and ensures proper memory allocation and freeing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a problem where there is a small gap between the jack detection unsolicited event and the time the ELD (EDID-like Data) is updated. This can cause failures when user-space queries the HDMI ELD immediately after receiving the notification.

To avoid this problem, the patch introduces a delay in the HDMI jack detection notification until the ELD information is fully updated. This delay ensures that user-space queries will not fail due to the timing gap.

The patch modifies the function `hdmi_present_sense` to return a boolean value indicating whether the ELD information is fully updated. If the ELD information is not fully updated, the function will trigger a repoll of the HDMI jack status. Additionally, if the ELD information is fully updated, the function will report the jack status using `snd_hda_jack_report_sync`.

The patch also includes a specific workaround for AMD codecs, which create the ELD by themselves. In this case, the function always returns true, indicating that the ELD information is fully updated.

Overall, the patch provides a workaround to ensure that the HDMI jack detection and ELD information are synchronized, reducing the chances of failures when querying the HDMI ELD immediately after receiving the jack detection notification.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch fixes a deadlock issue in the delayed_ref_async_start function in the btrfs file system.

4. The code changes in the patch modify the handle_mmio_cfg_reg function in the virt/kvm/arm/vgic.c file.

5. The offset variable is right-shifted by 1 to adjust the internal array offset.

6. The reg variable is assigned the value obtained from vgic_bitmap_get_reg using the adjusted offset.

7. The condition "if (offset & 4)" checks if the offset has the 4th bit set.

8. Depending on the condition, the val variable is assigned a value from the reg variable.

9. The vgic_reg_access function is called with the mmio structure, val, offset, and the ACCESS_READ_VALUE and ACCESS_WRITE_VALUE flags.

10. If mmio->is_write is true, the code performs additional operations based on the offset value.

11. If the offset is less than 8, the *reg variable is set to ~0U, forcing PPIs/SGIs to 1.

12. The val variable is compressed using vgic_cfg_compress.

13. Depending on the condition, the *reg variable is updated with the compressed value.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch addresses a specific issue related to accessing the GICD_ICFGR register in the KVM subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. The changes seem reasonable and do not introduce any obvious issues.

Considering that the erratum was fixed in Rev 2.0 of the P2020 processor, it is reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. By enabling the workaround, the patch ensures that frames larger than 2500 bytes with TOE enabled do not experience excessive delays before transmission.

Therefore, the answer is (A) the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch addresses a race condition in the xHCI (USB 3.0) driver. The issue occurs when a driver tries to cancel a URB (USB Request Block) while the host controller is dying. The xhci_urb_dequeue function gives back the URB without removing the xhci_tds (Transfer Descriptors) from the td_list or the cancelled_td_list. This can lead to a race condition between the driver calling URB dequeue and the stop endpoint command watchdog timer.

The patch modifies the handle_stopped_endpoint, xhci_stop_endpoint_command_watchdog, finish_td, and xhci_queue_isoc_tx functions to ensure that the TDs are removed from the TD lists and cancelled TD lists before giving back the URB.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided fix, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential race condition and improves the stability of the xHCI driver.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the information provided in the patch description. A more thorough review of the code changes and testing is recommended before final acceptance.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses an issue with the mvmdio driver's interrupt timeout handling. The current implementation of wait_event_timeout can result in premature timeouts due to a minimum wait of 0 to 1 jiffies when the timeout is set to 1ms with HZ as 1000. This can lead to incorrect behavior and potential issues.

The patch ensures a minimum timeout of 2 jiffies, guaranteeing that wait_event_timeout will always wait for at least 1 jiffie. This fix improves the reliability and correctness of the interrupt timeout handling.

Additionally, the patch includes a Tested-by tag from Nicolas Schichan, indicating that the fix has been tested successfully.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is related to the AMDGPU driver for handling the VCE (Video Codec Engine) power-gating flags properly. The patch adds a check to ensure that the VCE power-gating flags are enabled before attempting to start or stop the VCE block.

The patch includes changes in two files: vce_v2_0.c and vce_v3_0.c. In both files, the added check verifies if the AMDGPU_PG_SUPPORT_VCE flag is set in the pg_flags field of the amdgpu_device structure. If the flag is not set, the function returns 0, indicating that the power-gating state should not be changed.

This patch is important for ensuring that the VCE block is handled correctly when power-gating is disabled. By adding this check, unnecessary operations on the VCE block are avoided, improving the stability and efficiency of the driver.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Eric Huang and Alex Deucher, who are both recognized contributors to the AMDGPU driver.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch initializes the network_header and transport_header fields in the skb structure created in vnet_rx_one() function. This is necessary for vnet_fullcsum() to compute the checksum for IPv4 packets correctly.

2. The patch first resets the network_header field using skb_reset_network_header().

3. If the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM flag is set in dext->flags and the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, the patch initializes the iphdr structure pointer (iph) using ip_hdr(skb).

4. The patch sets iph->check to 0 and recalculates the IP checksum using ip_send_check(iph).

5. If the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag is set in dext->flags and skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE, the patch performs additional checks.

6. If the packet protocol is ETH_P_IP, the patch initializes the iphdr structure pointer (iph) again.

7. The patch calculates the IP header length (ihl) and resets the transport_header field using skb_reset_transport_header().

8. The patch sets the transport_header field to the correct offset (ihl) using skb_set_transport_header().

9. Finally, the patch calls vnet_fullcsum() to compute the full checksum for the packet.

Overall, the patch ensures that the network_header and transport_header fields are properly initialized and that the checksum calculations are performed correctly for IPv4 packets. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to fix data corruption on the 5725 family of devices with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) enabled. The issue occurs when the buffer is within MSS (Maximum Segment Size) bytes of a 4G boundary.

The patch introduces a new function `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` to test for TSO DMA buffers that cross into regions within MSS bytes of any 4GB boundaries. If the device is of ASIC revision 5762 and the MSS is non-zero, the function checks if the buffer crosses the boundary and triggers the workaround path if it does.

Additionally, the patch modifies the `tg3_tx_frag_set` function to call `tg3_4g_tso_overflow_test` and set the `hwbug` flag if the buffer crosses the boundary.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It addresses a specific data corruption issue on the 5725 family of devices and introduces a necessary workaround to prevent the problem.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch also sets the autosuspend delay and enables autosuspend for the host device. This is a good practice for power management and can help conserve energy when the device is idle.

3. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including the original author and maintainers, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

4. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or behavior changes. It only adds a necessary call to the context save function and updates the order of function calls.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the `omap_hsmmc` driver and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a double fetch bug in the ioctl function of the cros_ec_dev driver in the platform/chrome directory.

2. The patch verifies that the values of "u_cmd.outsize" and "u_cmd.insize" have not changed between the two copy_from_user() calls. This check ensures that there is no buffer overflow.

3. The patch also handles a scenario where cros_ec_cmd_xfer() can set s_cmd->insize to a lower value. It updates the value of s_cmd->insize to the new smaller value to prevent copying too much data to the user.

4. The patch includes the necessary metadata, such as the reported-by, fixes, signed-off-by, reviewed-by, and tested-by tags.

5. The patch has been reviewed and tested by multiple individuals, including Pengfei Wang, Dan Carpenter, Kees Cook, and Gwendal Grignou.

6. The patch is also marked for stable release, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in -stable releases.

However, it is important to note that further review and testing may be necessary to ensure the patch does not introduce any unintended side effects.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to simplify the ioc_release_fn() function in the block/blk-ioc.c file. The current implementation involves double lock dancing, which can be simplified by using trylock on the queue_lock and backing out from the ioc lock on trylock failure.

The changes made in the patch involve removing the last_q variable and the associated code that switches to a new request_queue. Instead, the patch introduces a new variable q, which represents the current request_queue being processed. The patch then attempts to acquire the queue_lock using spin_trylock(). If successful, it calls ioc_exit_icq() and releases the lock. If the trylock fails, it releases the ioc lock, performs a cpu_relax(), and then reacquires the ioc lock using spin_lock_irqsave_nested().

The patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary lock acquisition and release operations, reducing the complexity of the function. It also improves the performance by using spin_trylock() instead of spin_lock() when possible.

Overall, the changes in the patch appear to be valid and beneficial. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where work items are ignored for certain VIF types after a software scan in the mac80211 module. The problem occurs when the scan is complete, and work is requeued only for STA, ADHOC, and MESH iftypes. This can cause delays or non-processing of events for the AP iftype, leading to data halt and eventual disconnection on the AP interface.

The patch modifies the code in several files: ibss.c, mesh.c, mesh.h, mlme.c, and scan.c. In ibss.c, the line "ieee80211_queue_work(&local->hw, &sdata->work);" is removed from the ieee80211_ibss_notify_scan_completed function. In mesh.c, the entire ieee80211_mesh_notify_scan_completed function is removed. In mesh.h, the declaration of ieee80211_mesh_notify_scan_completed is removed. In mlme.c, the line "ieee80211_queue_work(&sdata->local->hw, &sdata->work);" is removed from the ieee80211_restart_sta_timer function. In scan.c, a new block of code is added to requeue all the work that might have been ignored during the scan.

The patch ensures that work items are requeued for all VIF types after a scan is complete, preventing delays and non-processing of events for the AP iftype. It improves the stability and reliability of the mac80211 module.

Considering the nature of the issue and the changes made by the patch, it appears to be a valid fix for the problem. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it seems that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the reasoning:

1. The patch addresses a bug in the btrfs_page_exists_in_range function, where incorrect types for page indices can lead to unexpected failures in page existence checks.

2. The bug can cause false negatives, indicating that there are no pages in a given range when there actually are. This can lead to issues in operations like hole punching and direct locking.

3. The bug occurs when the file is large, the affected range crosses the 16TiB boundary, and the internal state of the file pages and pending operations match. These conditions limit the practical occurrence of the bug.

4. The patch fixes the issue by using the correct types (unsigned long) for the page indices, ensuring that offsets larger than 1 << 44 are not silently trimmed off.

5. The patch includes appropriate CCs, Fixes, Reviewed-by, and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of SCSI devices being created at the OS level for non-existing virtual drives (VD) in the megaraid_sas driver. The issue arises when the ldTgtIdtoLd[] array is accessed beyond its size, which can result in valid LD values being returned for non-existing targets.

To fix this, the patch invalidates LD values (by setting them to 0xff) in the ldTgtIdtoLd[] array for device indices beyond the supported range. For legacy firmware (64 VD firmware), the invalidation is done for device indices beyond 127, and for extended VD firmware, it is done beyond 255.

The patch also includes changes in the megaraid_sas_fusion.c file to handle the ldTgtIdtoLd[] array correctly. It ensures that the driver does not access ldTgtIdtoLd[] beyond index 127 for older firmware or beyond the supported VD count for extended VD firmware.

Overall, the patch fixes the problem of non-existing VDs being exposed to the host and ensures that the driver handles ldTgtIdtoLd[] array access correctly for different firmware versions.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs filesystem. The issue arises because the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set after the inode hash table lock is released, potentially leading to a failure in finding existing inodes in the hash table.

2. The patch modifies the code to set the location field earlier during inode initialization, ensuring that the search for existing inodes in the hash table is not affected by the race condition.

3. The find actor function now uses only the location objectid to match inodes, which simplifies the search process.

4. The patch also updates the btrfs_iget_locked function to accept a struct btrfs_key *location parameter instead of a u64 objectid, allowing for the use of the updated location field.

5. The patch ensures that the BTRFS_I(inode)->root and BTRFS_I(inode)->location fields are correctly set during inode initialization.

6. The changes made in the patch do not affect the inode numbers shown to userland, as the inode hashing only requires a unique and stable test.

2. It replaces the ssm instruction with the stosm instruction, which is faster.
3. The patch introduces a new macro `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` to represent the enabled state of interrupts.
4. The `arch_local_irq_restore` function is modified to check if the flags indicate a transition from disabled to enabled interrupts. If so, it calls `arch_local_irq_enable` to enable interrupts.
5. The `arch_irqs_disabled_flags` function is modified to use the `ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED` macro for checking if interrupts are disabled.
6. The `paging_init` function in `arch/s390/mm/init.c` is modified to use the `__arch_local_irq_stosm` macro instead of `arch_local_irq_restore` to restore interrupts.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of irq restore by using a faster instruction and optimizing the interrupt enablement process. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a problem where the final spin_lock_irqrestore() at the end of the iteration uses the original flags saved from the initial irqsave() instead of the flags from the most recent irqsave(). This can lead to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

The fix modifies the qed_ll2_rxq_completion_reg() function by changing the lock_flags parameter to a pointer (p_lock_flags) and updating the function calls to pass the pointer instead of the original lock_flags. This ensures that the most recent flags are used when unlocking and re-locking the spinlock.

The patch also includes the Fixes tag, referencing the commit that introduced the issue, and the Signed-off-by tags from the authors.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to data corruption seen during read/write stress tests in the ti-qspi driver. The problem occurs when an invalid command is written to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG, which terminates the current transfer and de-asserts the chip select. However, if spi_finalize_current_message() is called before de-asserting the chip select, the next transfer can overlap with the previous one, leading to data corruption.

To fix this issue, the patch moves the command to write an invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG before calling spi_finalize_current_message(). This ensures that the chip select is de-asserted before marking the end of the current message transfer and scheduling the next transfer.

The patch also includes the necessary Cc and Signed-off-by tags.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent data corruption during stress tests in the ti-qspi driver.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
