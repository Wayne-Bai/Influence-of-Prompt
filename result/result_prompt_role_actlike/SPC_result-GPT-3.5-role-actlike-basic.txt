This patch declares the function "__jbd2_journal_temp_unlink_buffer()" as static. This means that the function can only be accessed within the same source file and cannot be called from other files. Since the function is only used within the same file, making it static improves code encapsulation and reduces the risk of accidental misuse.

Additionally, the patch removes the comment stating that the function is called under j_list_lock but the journal may not be locked. This comment is no longer accurate after making the function static, so it is appropriate to remove it.

Overall, this patch improves code encapsulation and removes an inaccurate comment, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

The patch removes the call to the function "nfs4_ds_disconnect()" in the file "nfs4filelayout.c". The reason for removing this call is that there is a possibility of another thread dereferencing "ds->ds_clp" during or after the call, resulting in a NULL pointer and a potential Oops. Instead, the patch relies on the function "filelayout_mark_devid_invalid()" to avoid this issue.

The removed function "nfs4_ds_disconnect()" is also defined in the header file "nfs4filelayout.h" and implemented in the file "nfs4filelayoutdev.c". This function is responsible for disconnecting a data server (DS) by zeroing the data server client pointer. However, it is not used anywhere else in the codebase.

Since the patch removes a potentially problematic call and does not introduce any new issues, it seems safe to accept it in Linux -stable releases.
true || ACK

The patch fixes an issue where calling dev_close() in the ixgbe_diag_test() function causes IFF_UP to be cleared, which removes the interface's routes and some addresses. This behavior is inconsistent and not what the user intended when running the offline selftest.

The patch addresses a potential lost wakeup scenario in the staging driver for the Quatech USB2 serial device. The current code waits for a change in the modem status by setting the task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and calling schedule(). However, there is a race condition between the loop in qt2_ioctl(TIOCMIWAIT) and the URB completion for new modem status in qt2_process_modem_status, which could result in a lost wakeup scenario.

The patch adds a barrier() to ensure memory ordering, sets the task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE before entering the loop, and sets it back to TASK_RUNNING when returning from the loop. These changes ensure that the usermode app's task will not continue to sleep despite a change in the modem status.

Reasoning:
The patch reverts a previous commit that was causing incorrect behavior in the ACPI battery driver. The previous commit was capping the capacity_now value to the full_charge_capacity value, which was causing wrong values to be reported and triggering bogus warnings. The patch argues that there is nothing wrong with the capacity_now value increasing above the full_charge_capacity value, as different charging cycles can cause the full_charge_capacity to vary. The patch also mentions that good battery firmwares will update the full_charge_capacity when the current charging cycle is complete. Therefore, reverting the previous commit is the correct action to take in order to fix the issue and avoid incorrect behavior and warnings.

Explanation:
The patch removes the "gpmc_fck" dummy clock from the clk-44xx.c, clk-54xx.c, and clk-7xx.c files in the TI OMAP4/5/DRA7 clock driver. This is necessary because when the gpmc.c file calls clk_get(..., "fck"), it gets a dummy clock with a rate of zero, which can result in divisions by zero and misconfigured timings. By removing the gpmc_fck dummy clock, gpmc.c can fail gracefully instead of causing issues with devices on the bus. The patch has been Acked by Tero Kristo and signed-off by Florian Vaussard and Tony Lindgren.

This patch adds a check to ensure that a guest which sets the PAT CR (Page Attribute Table Control Register) to an invalid value will receive a #GP (General Protection) exception. Currently, if the vmx (Virtual Machine Extensions) supports loading the PAT CR during entry, the value is not checked. This patch adds the necessary check in that case.

The patch modifies the vmx_set_msr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c to call the kvm_mtrr_valid function to check the validity of the PAT CR value. If the value is invalid, the function returns 1, indicating that the patch should not be accepted.

The patch also adds the kvm_mtrr_valid function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c, which checks the validity of the MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) values. This function is used by the set_msr_mtrr function to check the validity of the MTRR values. The kvm_mtrr_valid function returns true if the values are valid.

This patch adds support for NR_CPUS = 4096 on SPARC64 platforms. Currently, NR_CPUS is limited to 4064 due to a limitation in init_cpu_send_mondo_info() which only allocates a single page for NR_CPUS mondo entries. This patch fixes the issue by allocating (2^order) pages where order is set according to the size of cpu_list for possible CPUs. Since cpu_list_pa and cpu_mondo_block_pa are not used in asm code, there are no imm13 offsets from the base PA that will break because they can only reach one page.

This patch fixes a bug in the bcm_sysport_resume() function in the bcm_sysport driver. The bug can lead to receive FIFO corruptions when coming out of a suspend cycle. The patch adds a missing UniMAC reset, which resolves the issue.

The patch also includes a fix for a potential problem with Wake-on-LAN (WOL) on crowded networks. When WOL is enabled for this interface, packets are still forwarded to the host CPU interface, and leaving the UniMAC RX enable bit on allows matching MagicPackets. However, during the resume function, there is a small window where the UniMAC receive is still enabled, but the RDMA and RBUF engines are not ready. This can lead to packets getting stuck in the UniMAC RX FIFO and delivered as corrupted to the host CPU. The patch addresses this issue as well.
