security || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it is a security patch (SRP) or a non-security patch (NSP).

1. The patch is authored by tedu and committed on July 10, 2016. The author and commit date do not provide any immediate indication of whether it is a security patch or not.

2. Looking at the patch description, it mentions "zero the read buffer after copying data to the user so it doesn't linger." This indicates that the patch is addressing a potential security concern related to data lingering in the read buffer. This suggests that it could be a security patch (SRP).

3. Moving on to the code changes, the patch adds a line of code that uses the `memset` function to zero out the data in the read buffer after it has been copied to the user. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from lingering in memory. This further supports the notion that it is a security patch (SRP).

4. There are no explicit mentions of "memory leak" or "null pointer" problems in the patch description or code changes.

Based on the analysis, I would classify this patch as a security patch (SRP) because it addresses a potential security concern related to data lingering in the read buffer.
security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a security patch (SRP). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch description mentions fixing a memory leak issue. Memory leaks can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, as they can be exploited to exhaust system resources or cause unexpected behavior. Therefore, addressing a memory leak is often considered a security fix.

2. The patch specifically mentions that if `of_clk_parent_fill()` fails, an error message is printed, but the `sp810` variable is not freed. This indicates a potential memory leak if the function fails. By adding the line `kfree(sp810)`, the patch fixes the memory leak issue.

3. The patch is signed-off by the authors, indicating that it has gone through a review process and is considered necessary for the proper functioning and security of the software.

Based on these factors, it can be concluded that the provided patch is a security patch (SRP).
security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a security patch (SRP). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to a potential null pointer dereference.
2. The commit message explicitly mentions that the pointer 'n' returned from the call to the 'malloc' function at line 90 may be NULL and will be dereferenced at line 92.
3. The patch includes changes to the code in the 'handler_cgi_base.c' file, specifically in the 'env_item_new' function.
4. The patch adds a check after the 'malloc' call to verify if the allocated memory is NULL. If it is NULL, the function returns NULL, indicating a failure to allocate memory.
5. This check helps prevent potential crashes or vulnerabilities that could occur if the allocated memory is NULL and subsequently dereferenced.

Considering the patch's focus on addressing a potential null pointer dereference, it is reasonable to classify it as a security patch (SRP).
security || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a non-security patch (NSP).

This indicates that the patch addresses a memory leak issue, which is typically considered a security concern. Therefore, this is a strong indication that the patch is a security patch (SRP).

2. The patch code includes the following lines:
   ```
   if (ctx->mb_vlc_cust.table)
       free_vlc(&ctx->mb_vlc_cust);
   ```
   These lines free the custom VLCs for macroblock decoding, which further confirms that the patch is addressing a memory leak issue. Again, this suggests that the patch is a security patch (SRP).

3. The patch also includes the following lines:
   ```
   if (planes[p].bands[b].blk_vlc_cust.table)
       free_vlc(&planes[p].bands[b].blk_vlc_cust);
   ```
   These lines free the custom VLCs for block decoding, which is another indication of addressing a memory leak issue. This further supports the conclusion that the patch is a security patch (SRP).

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the given patch is a security patch (SRP) as it addresses memory leak issues related to custom VLCs for macroblock and block decoding.

1. The patch description mentions fixing a memory leak and properly handling errors. This indicates that the patch addresses a software issue related to memory management, which can potentially be a security concern. Therefore, it is necessary to further analyze the patch.

2. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the patch modifies the `pca9532_configure` function and the `pca9532_probe` function.

3. In the `pca9532_configure` function, the patch registers an LED device using the `led_classdev_register` function. If the registration fails (`led_classdev_register` returns a negative value), the patch saves the error and logs an error message. This change ensures that errors during LED registration are properly handled.

4. In the `pca9532_probe` function, the patch checks if the `pca9532_pdata` (platform data) is available. If it is not available, the function returns an error code (-EIO). This change ensures that the platform data is required for the probe to succeed.

5. The `pca9532_probe` function also calls the `pca9532_configure` function to configure the PCA9532 device. If the configuration fails (`pca9532_configure` returns a non-zero value), the patch frees the allocated memory and sets the client data to NULL.

Based on the analysis, the patch primarily focuses on fixing memory leaks, properly handling errors, and ensuring the availability of platform data. Although memory leaks and error handling can have security implications, the patch does not explicitly mention any security vulnerabilities or fixes related to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is considered a non-security patch (NSP).

non-security || Based on the provided patch, let's analyze it step-by-step to determine whether it is a security patch (SRP) or a non-security patch (NSP).

1. The patch description does not explicitly mention any vulnerabilities or security-related issues. However, it states that it fixes some nitpick Clang static analyzer warnings.

2. Looking at the diff, we can see changes made to two files: `m_sql_connpool.c` and `m_sql_report.c`.

3. In `m_sql_connpool.c`, the changes made are related to a loop that attempts to create a SQL connection. The patch modifies the condition `if (err == M_SQL_ERROR_SUCCESS || conn == NULL)` to `if (err == M_SQL_ERROR_SUCCESS)`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing a potential issue where a successful connection might not be properly handled.

4. In `m_sql_report.c`, the change made is within a loop that checks if certain data elements match specific conditions. The patch adds a condition `data != NULL` before the loop to ensure that the loop is only executed when `data` is not NULL. This change indicates that the patch is addressing a potential issue where the loop might encounter a NULL pointer.

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that this patch is a security patch (SRP). The changes made in both files address potential security vulnerabilities related to handling SQL connections and NULL pointer issues.
