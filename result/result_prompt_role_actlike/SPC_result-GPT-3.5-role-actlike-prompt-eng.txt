false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `sch_generic.c` file in the `net/sched` directory. It introduces a change in the handling of the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag in the `attach_one_default_qdisc` and `attach_default_qdiscs` functions.

The patch checks if the `tx_queue_len` is non-zero and the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is not set in the `dev->priv_flags` field. If both conditions are met, it creates a default qdisc using `qdisc_create_dflt` and attaches it to the device's queue. Otherwise, it skips attaching the default qdisc.

This change allows the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag to be used as an alternative to `tx_queue_len` being zero. It ensures that a default qdisc is not attached when either `tx_queue_len` is zero or the `IFF_NO_QUEUE` flag is set.

The patch has been reviewed and acknowledged by Jesper Dangaard Brouer, and it is signed-off by Phil Sutter and David S. Miller.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it fixes a channel mismatch issue and aligns the channel configuration with the capabilities of the ak4642 codec.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, it appears to be a valid and necessary change. The patch updates the virtio_net driver to use the new ethtool API functions, ethtool_{get|set}_link_ksettings, instead of the deprecated ethtool_{get|set}_settings.

The patch modifies the virtnet_validate_ethtool_cmd function to accept a pointer to the struct ethtool_link_ksettings instead of struct ethtool_cmd. It also updates the virtnet_set_settings and virtnet_get_settings functions to use the appropriate fields from the struct ethtool_link_ksettings.

Overall, this patch ensures that the virtio_net driver is using the latest ethtool API and removes the usage of deprecated functions.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch replaces the usage of smp_mb() with smp_store_mb/release() in the functions walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() and walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() in the arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c file.

The purpose of the patch is to ensure proper ordering of memory operations. In the walk_shadow_page_lockless_begin() function, the smp_store_mb() function is used to write the value READING_SHADOW_PAGE_TABLES to the vcpu->mode variable. This ensures that any subsequent spte read is not reordered ahead of the write to vcpu->mode.

Similarly, in the walk_shadow_page_lockless_end() function, the smp_store_release() function is used to write the value OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE to the vcpu->mode variable. This ensures that any previous reads to sptes are completed before setting vcpu->mode to OUTSIDE_GUEST_MODE.

By using smp_store_mb/release() instead of smp_mb(), the patch provides stronger memory ordering guarantees, which can help prevent potential race conditions and ensure correct behavior.

Therefore, considering the purpose and impact of the patch, it appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the `.owner` field for the `a3700_spi_driver` structure in the `spi-armada-3700.c` driver. The reason for this removal is to allow calls that automatically set the `.owner` field.

In general, the `.owner` field is used to keep track of the module that owns the driver. It is typically set to `THIS_MODULE` to ensure that the module is not unloaded while the driver is still in use.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact implications of removing the `.owner` field in this specific case. However, if the calls used in this driver automatically set the `.owner` field correctly, then removing it may not have any negative impact.

To make a decision, it would be helpful to understand the rationale behind the removal and any potential consequences. Additionally, it would be beneficial to review the code changes in the patch and ensure that they are correct and do not introduce any new issues.

Without this additional information, I would lean towards (B) not accepting the patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK) until further analysis and clarification are provided.

2. In the `mac802154_slave_open` function, the patch replaces the increment of `open_count` with a check if it is zero. If `open_count` is zero, it calls `drv_start(local)` and increments `open_count`. This change ensures that `drv_start` is only called once when `open_count` transitions from zero to one.

3. In the `mac802154_slave_close` function, the patch decrements `open_count` before calling `drv_stop(local)`. If `open_count` becomes zero after the decrement, `drv_stop` is called. This change ensures that `drv_stop` is only called once when `open_count` transitions from one to zero.

4. The patch also removes the unnecessary decrement of `open_count` in the error handling path of `mac802154_slave_open`.

Overall, the patch improves the clarity and correctness of the code by simplifying the handling of `open_count`. It ensures that the driver start and stop functions are called only when necessary. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

3. The patch replaces the existing WARN_ON() with WARN(1, "Unexpected command state (%d)", state), which provides more useful information by showing the "state" value.
4. The change improves the clarity and usefulness of the warning message, making it easier to understand and debug unexpected command states.

Overall, the patch improves the code quality and enhances the error reporting in the srpt_abort_cmd() function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses the issue of not checking the return values for the dvb_usb_generic_rw() and dvb_usb_generic_write() functions in the dvb-usb driver. By adding the __must_check attribute to the function declarations, it ensures that the return values are checked, which is important for proper error handling.

The __must_check attribute is used to indicate that the return value of a function must be checked by the caller. This helps prevent potential bugs and improves code reliability.

Since this patch improves error handling in the dvb-usb driver, it is considered a bug fix and should be included in stable releases to ensure the driver behaves correctly in case of errors.

Therefore, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the free_irq function call is being removed from the wl1251_spi_remove function. The reason given is that the irq is allocated with a devm_request_irq function call.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Is the removal of free_irq justified?
   The patch claims that the irq is allocated with devm_request_irq, which is a managed resource allocation function. If this is true, then the removal of free_irq is justified since the managed resource will be automatically released when the device is unregistered.

2. Are there any potential issues or side effects?
   Removing free_irq without proper justification could lead to resource leaks or other issues. It is important to ensure that the irq is indeed allocated and managed correctly by devm_request_irq.

3. Is the patch properly tested?

Based on the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if the following conditions are met:

- The claim that the irq is allocated with devm_request_irq is accurate.
- The patch has been tested and does not introduce any regressions or issues.

However, it is important to note that a more thorough review and testing of the patch is necessary before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue with wrong checks of power state bits in the ALSA hda/via driver. The problem lies in comparing the obtained value directly with the target value, which doesn't work as expected. 

The patch introduces a fix by properly shifting and masking the obtained value before comparing it with the target value. It retrieves the power state using the AC_VERB_GET_POWER_STATE verb, shifts the obtained value by 4 bits to the right, and applies a bitmask to extract the relevant bits. Then, it compares the modified state with the target value.

This fix ensures that the power state is correctly checked and prevents any incorrect comparisons. It improves the reliability and accuracy of power state handling in the hda/via driver.

Therefore, considering the nature of the issue and the effectiveness of the provided fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds variable resolution support to the gspca driver by allowing subdrivers to specify try_fmt and enum_framesizes functions. This enhancement can improve the flexibility and compatibility of the driver.

2. The patch modifies the try_fmt_vid_cap function to pass the original resolution to the subdriver's try_fmt function. This allows the subdriver to modify the format parameters if needed.

3. The vidioc_s_fmt_vid_cap function is modified to handle the case when the subdriver has a try_fmt function. If the subdriver has a try_fmt function, it sets the gspca_dev->pixfmt to the modified format parameters. Otherwise, it sets gspca_dev->pixfmt to the default format based on the selected mode.

4. The vidioc_enum_framesizes function is modified to call the subdriver's enum_framesizes function if it exists. This allows the subdriver to provide custom frame sizes.

5. The patch also adds two new function pointers (try_fmt and enum_framesizes) to the sd_desc structure, which are used by the subdrivers to implement the variable resolution support.

Overall, this patch adds important functionality to the gspca driver and does not introduce any obvious issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, the changes involve removing the __dev* attributes in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are used for hotplug support, which is being removed as an option in the kernel configuration.

The patch removes the __devinit, __devexit_p, __devinitdata, __devinitconst, and __devexit attributes from various functions in the skge and sky2 drivers. These attributes are used to mark functions that are only used during device initialization or removal.

Considering that the hotplug support is being removed and the __dev* attributes are no longer necessary, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch also addresses a warning from checkpatch.pl about a line exceeding 80 characters by splitting the line and adding the new local variable declaration.

4. The changes made by the patch do not introduce any new functionality or alter the existing behavior. They only improve code readability and maintainability.

Based on these factors, the patch appears to be a clean and beneficial change that does not introduce any risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch renames the `enum dio200_layout` to `enum dio200_layout_idx`. This change is a simple renaming and does not introduce any functional changes.

2. The comment in the patch states that the `enum dio200_layout` is only used once and renaming it frees up the `dio200_layout` tag for future use. This suggests that the renaming is done to improve code organization and potentially allow for future enhancements.

3. The patch is signed-off by two contributors, Ian Abbott and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

4. The change is made in the `drivers/staging/comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c` file, which is part of the staging directory. The staging directory is used for drivers that are not yet considered stable but are being actively developed and tested.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a names database to the port command in the usbip module. This enhancement improves the information displayed for imported USB devices.

2. The patch modifies the vendor string from "unknown" to "Hewlett-Packard" for the given USB device (03f0:0224). This change provides more accurate identification of the device.

3. The patch includes the necessary error handling and cleanup code. It initializes the names database and checks for any errors during initialization. If an error occurs, it frees the allocated resources and returns an error code.

4. The patch also ensures that the names database is freed before returning from the function, even in case of an error.

Overall, this patch improves the usability and accuracy of the usbip module by adding a names database and enhancing the vendor string. It also includes proper error handling and cleanup. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix and improvement for the iwlwifi driver in the Linux kernel. The patch implements a rate_update hook in the rs (rate scaling) module of the iwlwifi driver. It re-initializes the rate scaling when a rate_update hook is called, which occurs when a remote STA (station) changes bandwidth or sends a VHT opmode notification.

The patch includes changes in the mac80211.c, rs.c, and rs.h files of the iwlwifi driver. It adds a new parameter "init" to the rs_initialize_lq and iwl_mvm_rs_rate_init functions, which is used to control whether the rate scaling should be initialized or not. Additionally, a new function rs_rate_update is added to handle rate updates.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. It fixes a specific issue related to rate scaling in the iwlwifi driver and improves its functionality.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a straightforward code improvement. It removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "vb2_put_vma" in the "vb2_vmalloc_put_userptr" function. The patch has been reviewed and Acked by multiple developers.

Considering these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the HDMI PLL reset functionality from the code. The comment in the patch states that the SYSRESET bits in the HDMI PLL do not actually reset the PLL itself but only affect the power used for the PLL. Since there is no reason to use the SYSRESET bits and they are not used in other PLLs, the patch suggests removing the HDMI PLL reset to simplify the code and make it similar to other PLLs.

The patch removes the `hdmi_pll_reset` function, which was responsible for controlling the SYSRESET bits and waiting for the reset to complete. The function is no longer called in the `hdmi_pll_enable` function.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the HDMI PLL reset functionality is unnecessary and removing it simplifies the code. As long as the patch has been tested and does not introduce any regressions or issues, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `reconnect_one()` function in `fs/exportfs/expfs.c`. The purpose of this function is to reconnect a dentry (directory entry) to its parent directory after it has been disconnected due to a filesystem operation.

The patch replaces the usage of `lookup_one_len()` with `lookup_one_len_unlocked()`. The `lookup_one_len_unlocked()` function is a variant of `lookup_one_len()` that performs the lookup without acquiring the parent directory's inode lock. This change is made to address a specific scenario where the dentry being looked up may have been renamed by another process since the initial lookup in `exportfs_get_name()`.

The non-obvious logic in the patch is the conditional block that checks if `tmp` (the newly looked up dentry) is different from `dentry` (the original dentry). If they are different, it implies that the dentry has been renamed by another process. In this case, the patch simply releases the newly looked up dentry (`dput(tmp)`) and proceeds to the `out_reconnected` label, indicating that the reconnection process is complete.

The reasoning behind this logic is that if the dentry has been renamed, it must have been looked up and connected by another process. Therefore, there is no need to proceed with the reconnection process, as the dentry remains connected. This optimization avoids unnecessary locking and lookup operations.

Overall, the patch appears to be a reasonable and safe optimization that improves the efficiency of the reconnection process in the `exportfs` subsystem. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for ARM architecture related to the vm_struct and ioremap mappings. The patch ensures that the phys_addr member of the vm_struct structure is filled in, allowing /proc/vmallocinfo to display the physical address for ioremap mappings.

Considering the nature of the patch as a bug fix and the Acked-by and Signed-off-by tags from recognized contributors, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, further analysis and testing are necessary to ensure that the patch does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces NULL values returned by `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` with error pointer values. This is a good practice as it provides more specific error information.

2. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` when too many instances of the audio service are initialized. This is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in handling the error gracefully.

3. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)` when `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory. Again, this is a valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in proper error handling.

4. The patch returns `ERR_PTR(-EPERM)` when VCHI connections fail to open. This is another valid error condition, and returning an error pointer helps in distinguishing between different error scenarios.

5. The patch replaces a NULL check with `IS_ERR(..)` where `vc_vchi_audio_init(...)` is called. This change ensures that the error pointer is properly checked and handled.

Overall, the patch improves error handling and provides more specific error information. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to remove the unused functions `psbfb_suspend()` and `psbfb_resume()` from the `framebuffer.c` file in the `gma500` driver. These functions are responsible for suspending and resuming the framebuffer. 

Considering that these functions are not used anywhere in the codebase, removing them seems reasonable. Unused code can potentially introduce unnecessary complexity and increase the maintenance burden. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces the use of an enum for DRM_MINOR_* constants instead of hard-coding the IDs. This improves code readability and maintainability.

2. The addition of DRM_MINOR_CNT allows for range-checks in follow-up code, which can help prevent potential issues.

3. The IDs of the minor-types are changed by -1, but since they are not used as indices, this change does not introduce any functional problems.

4. The patch includes a signed-off-by line from the author and a reviewed-by line from another developer, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested.

Overall, the patch seems to be a clean and beneficial change that improves the codebase. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch.

The patch modifies the `ur_set_online` function in the `vmur.c` file of the s390/vmur driver. The purpose of the patch is to link the parent CCW device during UR device creation.

The specific change made by the patch is in the `device_create` function call. Previously, the parent device was set to `NULL`, but with the patch, the parent device is set to `&cdev->dev`, which is the parent CCW device.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The change seems to be a logical improvement as it ensures that the parent CCW device is properly linked during UR device creation.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes redundant code in the bnx2x_init_dev() function. The function was setting the device power state to D0 using bnx2x_set_power_state(), but this is unnecessary because Pci_enable_device() already sets the device power state to D0. Removing this redundant code improves code clarity and efficiency.

2. The patch also removes redundant code for finding the power management capability (PM Cap) of the PCI device. The PM Cap value is already saved by the PCI core, so there is no need to find it again using pci_find_capability(). Removing this redundant code simplifies the function and avoids unnecessary operations.

3. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

Overall, the patch improves code efficiency and removes redundant operations without introducing any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the "perf record" command. This option allows explicit enabling of CPU sample type, which is currently only enabled implicitly for CPU-related targets. This addition enhances the functionality of the "perf record" tool.

2. The patch includes the necessary changes in the "builtin-record.c" file to handle the new option. It adds the "--sample-cpu" option to the list of available options and sets the "record.opts.sample_cpu" flag accordingly.

3. The "perf.h" file is modified to include the "sample_cpu" flag in the "record_opts" structure.

4. The "evsel.c" file is updated to check if the "sample_cpu" flag is set or if the target has a CPU. If either condition is true, the CPU sample bit is set for the event selector.

Overall, this patch introduces a new option that allows explicit control over CPU sample type in the "perf record" command. It appears to be a useful addition and does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a race condition in the `dm_thin_find_block()` function of the `dm-thin-metadata.c` file. The issue is that the `->fail_io` flag is checked outside the `metadata` device's `root_lock`, which can lead to a race condition with the setting of this flag.

The patch fixes this by moving the check for `pmd->fail_io` inside the `root_lock` section. If `pmd->fail_io` is true, the function returns `-EINVAL` and releases the `root_lock` before doing so.

This patch ensures that the `->fail_io` flag is properly synchronized with the `root_lock`, preventing any race conditions. Therefore, it improves the stability and reliability of the code.

Hence, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a warning related to NOHZ local_softirq_pending. This indicates that the patch addresses a known issue and aims to resolve it.

2. The patch replaces the usage of netif_rx() with netif_rx_ni(). The latter function is specifically designed to be used from process/softirq context. This change ensures that the correct function is used in the appropriate context, which can help prevent potential issues or race conditions.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The change is localized to the dp83640.c file within the drivers/net/phy directory, which suggests that it is specific to the functionality provided by that driver.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the warning and improve the stability of the affected functionality.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple addition of a MODULE_ALIAS for the aat2870-regulator platform. This patch is not likely to introduce any functional changes or bug fixes. 

In general, patches that only add MODULE_ALIAS or similar metadata are typically considered low-risk and can be accepted in stable releases. However, it is important to note that the decision to include a patch in a stable release ultimately depends on the specific policies and guidelines of the Linux kernel maintainers.

false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new advertising setting called "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" to the existing enum in "hci.h". This new setting allows switching the controller into connectable mode independently of the global connectable setting.

2. In "mgmt.c", the "enable_advertising" function is modified to check if the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set. If it is set, the "connectable" variable is set to true, otherwise, it calls the existing "get_connectable" function.

3. In the "set_advertising" function, the patch adds support for the new advertising setting. If the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag is set, it sets the "connectable" flag accordingly. Additionally, it handles the case when the "cp->val" is 0x02, which corresponds to the new advertising setting. It sets or clears the "HCI_ADVERTISING_CONNECTABLE" flag accordingly.

4. Finally, the "enable_advertising" function is called with the modified "req" structure, which takes into account the new advertising setting.

Overall, this patch adds a useful feature to the Bluetooth subsystem by allowing independent control of the connectable mode during advertising. It does not introduce any obvious issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes it introduces:

Based on this information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch extends the frequency range for ATSC support, which improves the functionality of the Si2157 tuner.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the '0x' notation from the %pad format specifier used in the dev_dbg() statements. The %pad format specifier automatically prints the value in hexadecimal format, including the '0x' prefix. However, in this case, the '0x' prefix is unnecessary and can result in a '0x0x' string.

By removing the '0x' prefix, the dev_dbg() statements will print the value correctly without the redundant '0x' prefix.

The patch has been signed-off by multiple developers, including Fabio Estevam, Paul Zimmerman, and Greg Kroah-Hartman. This indicates that the patch has been reviewed and approved by these individuals.

Therefore, considering the simplicity and correctness of the patch, as well as the sign-off from multiple developers, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing forward declarations of `struct super_block` in multiple files (`drivers/oprofile/oprof.h`, `drivers/oprofile/oprofile_stats.h`, and `include/linux/oprofile.h`).

In general, forward declarations are used to declare a type before it is fully defined, allowing the compiler to recognize the type without needing the complete definition. However, if the forward declaration is not necessary or if it becomes redundant due to changes in the codebase, it can be removed.

In this case, since the forward declarations of `struct super_block` are being removed, it suggests that the code no longer relies on these declarations. To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Impact on functionality: Removing forward declarations should not impact the functionality of the code. It is important to ensure that the removal does not introduce any bugs or break any existing functionality.

2. Code maintainability: If the forward declarations are no longer needed, removing them can improve code readability and maintainability. It reduces unnecessary clutter and makes the code easier to understand.

3. Compatibility: The patch should not introduce any compatibility issues with other parts of the codebase or external dependencies.

Based on the provided information, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch changes the declaration of `pcpu_fc_names` from `extern const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` to `extern const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR];` in the `include/linux/percpu.h` header file. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array, indicating that the array elements are constant pointers.

In the `mm/percpu.c` file, the patch modifies the definition of `pcpu_fc_names` from `const char *pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initdata` to `const char * const pcpu_fc_names[PCPU_FC_NR] __initconst`. This change adds the `const` qualifier to the array and also changes the attribute from `__initdata` to `__initconst`, indicating that the array is initialized with constant data during the initialization phase.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is a correct fix for section conflicts in the `mm/percpu.c` file. The addition of the `const` qualifier ensures that the array elements are treated as constant pointers, which can help prevent unintended modifications. Additionally, the change in attribute from `__initdata` to `__initconst` ensures that the array is properly initialized during the initialization phase.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (A) and including it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. Purpose of the patch:
   - The patch aims to improve the performance of the `search_memslots` function in the KVM subsystem by adding a simple LRU (Least Recently Used) memslot caching mechanism.
   - It states that in typical guest boot workloads, only 2-3 memslots are extensively used, and the same memslot lookup operation is performed repeatedly.

2. Changes introduced by the patch:
   - A new member `lru_slot` of type `atomic_t` is added to the `struct kvm_memslots` to store the index of the most recently used memslot.
   - The `search_memslots` function is modified to utilize the LRU cache:
     - It first checks if the requested guest frame number (gfn) falls within the base and end addresses of the most recently used memslot. If so, it returns the memslot directly.
     - If not, it iterates over all memslots to find the appropriate one and updates the `lru_slot` with the index of the found memslot.

3. Benefits of the patch:
   - The patch claims to improve the average lookup time for the given workload from 46 to 28 cycles, resulting in approximately a 40% improvement.
   - By caching the most recently used memslot, the patch reduces the need for iterating over all memslots in most cases, leading to faster lookup operations.

4. Potential concerns:
   - The patch does not mention any potential drawbacks or side effects.
   - It assumes that the workload being optimized is representative of typical guest boot workloads.

Considering the benefits and the absence of mentioned concerns, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is always advisable to thoroughly test the patch in various scenarios to ensure its stability and performance improvements.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch introduces a new local variable `r` and initializes it to 1, indicating that the guest state should be resumed. The function checks for specific requests using `kvm_check_request` and performs corresponding actions based on the request type. After processing the requests, the function returns the value of `r`.

The change to the return type allows requests to indicate whether the host state needs to be resumed or not. This can be useful for handling specific scenarios or conditions within the virtual machine.

Overall, the patch seems to be a reasonable and necessary modification to the code. It introduces a return value to the function, allowing requests to influence the behavior of the virtual machine. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

2. The `its_read_baser` function takes an `its_node` structure and a `struct its_baser` pointer as arguments. It calculates the index of the `baser` within the `its->tables` array and reads the corresponding register value using `readq_relaxed`. The function returns the read value.

3. The `its_write_baser` function takes the same arguments as `its_read_baser` along with a `u64` value to be written. It calculates the index of the `baser` within the `its->tables` array and writes the value to the corresponding register using `writeq_relaxed`. After writing, it updates the `baser->val` field by calling `its_read_baser` with the same arguments.

4. The patch modifies the `its_alloc_tables` function to use the new helper functions. Instead of directly accessing the register values using `readq_relaxed` and `writeq_relaxed`, it now uses `its_read_baser` and `its_write_baser` respectively.

5. The `its_alloc_tables` function iterates over the `its->tables` array and performs various operations on each `struct its_baser`. The patch replaces the direct register access with the helper functions, making the code more readable and maintainable.

6. The patch also fixes a typo in the code where `its_write_baser_cache` is replaced with `its_write_baser`.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the bonding driver's `bond_fill_info` function in the `bond_netlink.c` file. The purpose of the patch is to add error handling for the `nla_put_be32` function call.

In the original code, the `nla_put_be32` function is called without checking its return value. The patch adds an `if` statement to check the return value of `nla_put_be32`. If the return value is non-zero, indicating an error, the code jumps to a label called `nla_put_failure`.

This change ensures that if the `nla_put_be32` function fails to add the attribute to the `skb` (socket buffer), the code will handle the failure appropriately.

By adding this error handling, the patch improves the robustness of the bonding driver by properly handling potential failures during the attribute addition process.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a section mismatch in the `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` function in the `ie6xx_wdt.c` file. The `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is currently annotated as `__devexit`, but it is being called from `ie6xx_wdt_probe()` as part of the error cleanup path.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Section mismatch: Section mismatches can lead to issues such as memory corruption or crashes. It is generally recommended to fix section mismatches to ensure proper code execution.

2. __devexit annotation: The `__devexit` annotation is used to mark functions that are only used during device initialization and can be discarded after that. However, in this patch, the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function is being called from `ie6xx_wdt_probe()`, which suggests that it may still be needed beyond device initialization.

Based on these factors, I would recommend (B) not accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (NAK). The section mismatch should be addressed, and the `__devexit` annotation should be used correctly to ensure proper code execution and maintain the intended behavior of the `ie6xx_wdt_debugfs_exit()` function.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the "cpu" argument from the rcu_pending() function. The argument is guaranteed to always be the current CPU, so it is unnecessary. This simplifies the function's signature and usage.

2. The patch replaces the per_cpu_ptr() macro with this_cpu_ptr(). This change ensures that the function operates on the current CPU's data, improving code clarity and maintainability.

3. The patch modifies the rcu_pending() function to no longer take any arguments. Since the function only operates on the current CPU's data, there is no need for the "cpu" argument.

4. The patch updates the rcu_check_callbacks() function to call rcu_pending() without any arguments, as the current CPU is already known. This change improves code readability and reduces redundancy.

Overall, the patch simplifies the code by removing unnecessary arguments and replacing macros with more appropriate alternatives. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential issues. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch fixes the logging mechanism for link up/down messages in the ixgbevf driver. Previously, the patch used the hw_dbg function to log these messages, but it has been changed to use the dev_info function instead. This change improves the consistency of logging across the kernel and aligns with the recommended practice of using dev_info for such messages.

The patch also includes a tested-by tag, indicating that it has been tested by Sibai Li from Intel. This adds credibility to the patch and suggests that it has undergone some level of testing.

Overall, the patch addresses a logging issue and improves the code consistency. It does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the mx51_clocks_init() function is being converted to a Device Tree (DT) call. This change is being made because the i.MX51 platform is becoming DT only. 

The mx51_clocks_init() function is currently defined as an initialization function that takes four arguments: rate_ckil, rate_osc, rate_ckih1, and rate_ckih2. However, in the patch, these arguments are no longer being used. Instead, the mx5_clocks_common_init() function is being called with all arguments set to 0.

The mx51_clocks_init_dt() function, which was previously defined separately, is now being removed and replaced with the mx51_clocks_init() function.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. The change aligns with the transition to DT-only platforms and simplifies the code by removing unused arguments.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the use of __devinitdata in the staging driver for rtl8187se. The reason for this removal is that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option, making __devinitdata unnecessary.

5. The patch reads pinmux values from the device tree and handles any errors that occur.
6. The patch finds the corresponding pin group and handles errors if it fails to match.
7. The patch calls mtk_pctrl_dt_node_to_map_func() to map the pin, func, and group, handling any errors that occur.
8. The patch adds map configurations if has_config is true, handling any errors that occur.
9. The patch frees the allocated memory for configs before returning.

Overall, the patch addresses a memory leak and adds proper error handling. It ensures that the required pins and maps_per_pin are present, and handles errors at each step. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the `ioh_gpio_get` function in the `gpio-ml-ioh.c` driver file. The original implementation returns the value of `ioread32(&chip->reg->regs[chip->ch].pi) & (1 << nr)`, which is the result of a bitwise AND operation between the register value and a bitmask.

The patch changes the return statement to `return !!(ioread32(&chip->reg->regs[chip->ch].pi) & (1 << nr))`. This modification uses the `!!` operator to convert the result of the bitwise AND operation into a boolean value (0 or 1). This ensures that the return value is clamped to either 0 or 1, regardless of the original value.

The purpose of this change is to allow the `.get()` calls in the `gpio_chip` structure to return negative error codes and propagate them to drivers. By clamping the return value to [0,1], the patch ensures that the return value is consistent and can be properly handled by the drivers.

Overall, this patch seems to be a reasonable and necessary modification to ensure proper error handling and propagation in the GPIO subsystem. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

The patch modifies the function `host1x_bo_lookup()` in the `gr2d.c` file of the `drm/tegra` driver. The purpose of the patch is to fix the return value of the function.

Currently, the function returns 0 when the `drm_gem_object_lookup()` call fails to find a valid gem object. However, returning 0 implies success, which is incorrect in this case. The patch changes the return value to NULL, which is more appropriate for indicating failure.

The change ensures that when the `gem` object is not found, the function returns NULL instead of 0. This aligns with the expected behavior and allows the calling code to handle the failure appropriately.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward fix that improves the correctness of the code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to replace the usage of the `hid_output_raw_report` function with `hid_hw_output_report` in the `wiimote_hid_send` function of the `hid-wiimote-core.c` file. The reason for this change is that the new API is considered equivalent and should be used where available.

The patch checks if the `ll_driver->output_report` function pointer is available before using it. If it is not available, the function returns `-ENODEV`, indicating that the new API is not supported by the driver.

The patch then duplicates the buffer using `kmemdup` and passes it to the `hid_hw_output_report` function, along with the count parameter. The return value of `hid_hw_output_report` is assigned to the `ret` variable.

Finally, the duplicated buffer is freed using `kfree`, and the `ret` value is returned.

Overall, the patch seems to be a straightforward replacement of the deprecated function with the new API. It ensures backward compatibility by checking if the new API is supported before using it. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

2. The patch removes the "frequency" member from the "struct meson_i2c" as it is no longer needed. The bus frequency is fixed based on the value set in the device tree (DT).

3. The "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is modified to accept the frequency as an argument, allowing it to set the clock divider based on the provided frequency.

4. The "meson_i2c_xfer" function no longer calls "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" as the clock divider is now set in the probe function. This change simplifies the code and avoids unnecessary clock divider updates during transfers.

5. The "meson_i2c_probe" function reads the clock frequency from the device tree and assigns it to the "freq" variable. If the clock frequency is not specified in the device tree, it defaults to "DEFAULT_FREQ".

6. Finally, the "meson_i2c_set_clk_div" function is called in the probe function to set the clock divider based on the frequency obtained from the device tree.

Overall, this patch improves the efficiency of the i2c-meson driver by setting the clock divider in the probe function and removing unnecessary clock divider updates during transfers. It also simplifies the code by removing the "frequency" member from the structure. Therefore, it is recommended to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to correct the number of bitrates in the mwifiex driver's supported bitrate array. Previously, the patch removed two bitrates (22Mbps and 72Mbps) from the array, reducing the number of bitrates from 14 to 12. However, the ".n_bitrates" field was not updated accordingly and remained hardcoded as 14.

The proposed change initializes the ".n_bitrates" field to the size of the mwifiex_rates array using the ARRAY_SIZE macro. This ensures that the correct number of bitrates is reflected in the ".n_bitrates" field.

By making this change, the mwifiex driver will accurately report the number of supported bitrates, which is essential for proper functionality.

Therefore, this patch appears to be a valid fix and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to add support for detecting the "interlock-and-broadcast-suppression" (IBS) facility on s390 architecture.

This ensures that the port driver's `.set_termios` method is called before modifying the flags, preventing any mismatch between the termios settings and port flags.

4. The patch also adds a line to reload the cflag from termios after calling `uart_change_speed`. This is necessary because the port driver may have overridden the flags, and this ensures that the correct cflag value is used.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific issue related to termios/port flags mismatch and has been reviewed and signed-off by developers. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch moves the `qos_request` field from the `saa7134_fh` structure to the `saa7134_dev` structure. This change makes sense because `qos_request` is a global field and not specific to a file handle.

2. In the `saa7134_streamon` function, the `pm_qos_add_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is added to the correct `qos_request` field.

3. Similarly, in the `saa7134_streamoff` function, the `pm_qos_remove_request` function is updated to use `dev->qos_request` instead of `fh->qos_request`. This change ensures that the request is removed from the correct `qos_request` field.

4. In the `saa7134_fh` structure, the `qos_request` field is removed since it is no longer needed.

5. In the `saa7134_dev` structure, the `qos_request` field is added to store the `qos_request` for the device.

The patch modifies the scan_read_raw_oob(), scan_block_fast(), and scan_block_slow() functions in the nand_bbt.c file of the MTD (Memory Technology Devices) subsystem. The purpose of the patch is to ignore ECC (Error Correction Code) errors when scanning for simple bad block markers (BBM).

In the scan_read_raw_oob() function, the patch adds a check for the return value of mtd->read_oob(). If the return value is -EUCLEAN or -EBADMSG, indicating an ECC error, the function returns 0, effectively ignoring the error. This change ensures that ECC errors are not treated as actual bad blocks during the scanning process.

Similarly, in the scan_block_fast() and scan_block_slow() functions, the patch adds the same check for the return value of mtd->read_oob(). If the return value is -EUCLEAN or -EBADMSG, indicating an ECC error, the functions return the error code, effectively ignoring the error.

Overall, the patch introduces a specific handling mechanism for ECC errors during the scanning process for simple bad block markers. By ignoring ECC errors in this context, the patch ensures that true bad blocks are correctly identified and not mistakenly treated as ECC errors.

Considering the patch's purpose and the correctness of the implementation, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch adds a new function `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_min_inline` to the `vport.c` file in the Mellanox mlx5 driver.
2. The function takes the Mellanox core device (`mdev`), virtual port (`vport`), and minimum inline header mode (`min_inline`) as parameters.
3. Inside the function, it initializes an input buffer (`in`) and sets the necessary fields for modifying the minimum inline header mode.
4. The function then calls `mlx5_modify_nic_vport_context` with the input buffer to modify the NIC vport context.
5. The patch also adds a declaration for the new function in the `vport.h` file.
6. Additionally, the patch modifies the `mlx5_ifc_modify_nic_vport_field_select_bits` structure in the `mlx5_ifc.h` file to include the `min_inline` field.

Based on this analysis, it appears that the patch adds a new functionality to the Mellanox mlx5 driver, allowing the minimum inline header mode to be modified for virtual ports. This functionality seems specific to the Mellanox hardware and driver, and it does not introduce any changes to the existing behavior or interfaces used by other parts of the Linux kernel.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) if it has been properly tested and reviewed by the relevant maintainers and developers.

3. The suspend_bias_off flag indicates that the CODEC driver should automatically set the bias level to off during suspend, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

4. The patch removes the manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in the resume function, as it is no longer necessary with the introduction of the suspend_bias_off flag.

5. The patch also removes the adau17x1_suspend function, which is no longer needed since the suspend_bias_off flag handles the bias level transition during suspend.

6. The adau17x1_resume function is modified to call the switch_mode function if adau->switch_mode is true, and then syncs the register cache using regcache_sync.

7. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the driver. It only improves code organization and readability.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement to the ASoC adau17x1 CODEC driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

1. The patch aims to improve the i40e driver by preventing the usage of certain functions when the VLAN ID (VID) is less than 1 or when the Port VLAN ID (PVID) is set. This change ensures that the i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan functions are not mistakenly invoked in such scenarios.

2. The patch updates the function signatures of i40e_vsi_add_vlan and i40e_vsi_kill_vlan to take u16 (unsigned 16-bit integer) instead of s16 (signed 16-bit integer) since they no longer expect to be called with VID=I40E_VLAN_ANY.

3. The i40e_vsi_add_vlan function is modified to return -EINVAL if the VID is 0 or if the PVID is set, indicating an invalid VLAN configuration.

4. The i40e_vsi_kill_vlan function is modified to return immediately if the VID is 0 or if the PVID is set, avoiding unnecessary operations.

Overall, this patch improves the behavior and correctness of the i40e driver when handling VLAN configurations. It introduces necessary checks and ensures that the functions are used appropriately. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes spurious NULL checking in the ipx_ioctl() function. It is mentioned that 'sk' is unconditionally dereferenced earlier in the function via lock_sock(sk). The caller of ipx_ioctl(), sock_do_ioctl(), also takes similar liberties.

The reported issue is that there is unnecessary NULL checking for 'sk' in the SIOCGSTAMP case. The patch removes this redundant check and directly calls sock_get_timestamp().

Since 'sk' is already dereferenced earlier in the function, there is no need for the additional NULL check. Removing this check simplifies the code and improves its readability.

Considering these factors, the patch appears to be a valid improvement and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new property called "phy-reset-duration" for device tree probe. This property allows boards to specify a longer reset duration for the phy if needed. This is a useful addition as different boards may require different reset durations.

2. The patch includes a check to ensure that the reset duration is not longer than 1 second (1000 milliseconds). If the duration specified in the device tree is greater than 1000, it is set to 1 millisecond instead. This ensures that the reset duration remains within a reasonable range.

3. The patch modifies the "fec_reset_phy" function to read the "phy-reset-duration" property from the device tree and use it as the reset duration. If the property is not present, the default duration of 1 millisecond is used.

4. The patch also includes proper error handling in case the GPIO request for phy reset fails.

Overall, this patch adds a useful feature to the Linux kernel by allowing boards to specify a custom reset duration for the phy. It includes necessary checks and error handling, making it a suitable addition to the stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to convert the comedi_subdevice access from pointer math to array access in the pcmad driver. This change replaces the line `s = dev->subdevices + 0;` with `s = &dev->subdevices[0];`.

The modification improves code readability and maintainability by using a more explicit and standard way of accessing the subdevice array. It eliminates the need for pointer arithmetic, which can be error-prone and harder to understand.

Since this patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it is considered a clean-up or code improvement. Such changes are generally accepted in stable releases to enhance code quality and maintainability.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a simple constification of the `nct7802_regmap_config` struct in the `hwmon/nct7802.c` file. The patch changes the declaration of `nct7802_regmap_config` from a non-const struct to a const struct.

Considering that the `regmap_config` struct is not modified by the driver and `regmap_init()` accepts a pointer to const, it seems reasonable to make this change. By making the struct const, it ensures that the compiler enforces immutability and prevents accidental modifications.

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the unnecessary disabling and re-enabling of interrupts in the `meson_mmc_request` function. This change improves the efficiency of interrupt handling.

2. The patch adds the missing interrupt disabling in the `meson_mmc_remove` function. This ensures that interrupts are properly disabled during device removal.

3. The patch enables interrupts in the `meson_mmc_probe` function, which was missing before. This ensures that interrupts are enabled during device initialization.

Overall, the patch improves interrupt handling in the `meson-gx-mmc` driver by enabling interrupts during probe and disabling them during removal. These changes are necessary for proper interrupt handling and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential interactions with other parts of the Linux kernel.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch is removing the use of the "__devinit" attribute in the xgifb driver. The "__devinit" attribute is used to mark functions that are only called during device initialization and are not needed after that. 

However, the patch is removing the "__devinit" attribute from the "xgifb_probe" function, which suggests that this function may be called even after device initialization. This could potentially lead to issues if the function is called at a later stage when it is not expected.

Considering that the "__devinit" attribute is no longer needed due to the removal of the CONFIG_HOTPLUG option, it would be more appropriate to remove the "__devinit" attribute from all functions in the xgifb driver, including the "xgifb_probe" function.

Therefore, I would recommend modifying the patch to remove the "__devinit" attribute from all relevant functions in the xgifb driver. Once this modification is made, the patch can be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes unnecessary checks in the KVM MMU code, specifically in the mmu_need_write_protect() and kvm_mmu_pte_write() functions.

2. In mmu_need_write_protect(), the patch removes the need_unsync check and simplifies the code by directly checking if s->unsync is false. This change does not affect the logic of the function and improves code readability.

3. In kvm_mmu_pte_write(), the patch removes the remote_flush check and simplifies the code by directly checking if need_remote_flush() returns true. This change does not affect the logic of the function and improves code readability.

4. The patch has been signed-off by two developers, Gleb Natapov and Marcelo Tosatti, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement to the KVM MMU code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve the code by avoiding redundant calls to the function ilk_pipe_pixel_rate(). Previously, the function skl_pipe_pixel_rate() was called, which had a simple one-line return. However, now the function ilk_pipe_pixel_rate() is being called, which is more complex. The patch suggests calling ilk_pipe_pixel_rate() once and storing the computed value for reuse.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:
- A variable named pixel_rate is introduced to store the value returned by ilk_pipe_pixel_rate().
- The WARN_ON() macro is used to check if pixel_rate is zero. If it is, the function returns 0.
- The return statement is modified to use the stored pixel_rate value instead of calling ilk_pipe_pixel_rate() again.

The patch appears to be a straightforward optimization that reduces redundant function calls and improves code readability. It does not introduce any new functionality or change the behavior of the code. Therefore, it should be safe to include in Linux -stable releases.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the provided patch and does not consider any potential interactions with other parts of the Linux kernel. A thorough review and testing of the patch in the context of the entire kernel codebase is recommended before final acceptance.

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the calculation of the address of query 8 in the HID RMI (Human Interface Device, Synaptics touchpad) driver. It introduces a dynamic calculation of the address based on the presence of query registers, specifically query 6 and query 10.

The current code hardcodes the offset for query 8, assuming the presence of query 6 and query 10. However, if a touchpad does not report relative data, query 6 will not be present, and the address of query 8 will be one less. This patch calculates the location of query 8 dynamically, taking into account the presence of query 6 and query 10.

By introducing this dynamic calculation, the patch ensures that the correct address of query 8 is used, regardless of the presence or absence of query 6. This improves the reliability and compatibility of the HID RMI driver for touchpads.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Andrew Duggan and Jiri Kosina, indicating that it has undergone a review process and received approval from the relevant parties.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the breakdown of my analysis:

1. The patch moves the 64-bit feature fixup earlier in the code, specifically to the early_setup() function.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that there is a possible issue with the if test in the toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store function in the toshiba-acpi.c file. The current if test checks if the sscanf function does not return 1 and if the mode is not equal to 2 or 1. However, the intended logic might be to check if the mode is not equal to 2 and not equal to 1.

To clarify, the current if test is:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 && (mode != 2 || mode != 1))
```

The proposed change is:
```
if (sscanf(buf, "%i", &mode) != 1 || (mode != 2 && mode != 1))
```

5. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be well-written and addresses a specific issue in the driver. It improves the reliability and correctness of the mpl3115 driver, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch is titled "Staging: hv: vmbus: Cleanup error codes in hv.c." This suggests that it aims to improve error handling in the vmbus driver, which is part of the staging area in the Linux kernel.

2. The patch includes changes to the `hv_post_message` function in the `hv.c` file. It modifies the error handling code related to payload size and memory allocation.

3. Previously, if the payload size exceeded a certain limit (`HV_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD_BYTE_COUNT`), the function would return -1, indicating a generic error. The patch changes this behavior to return `EMSGSIZE`, which is a more specific error code indicating that the payload size is too large.

4. Similarly, if memory allocation fails, the function previously returned -1. The patch updates this to return `ENOMEM`, which is the standard error code for out-of-memory conditions.

5. The changes ensure that the error codes returned by the function are more descriptive and aligned with standard Linux kernel error codes.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a straightforward improvement to error handling in the vmbus driver. It does not introduce any new functionality or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

2. The patch introduces a new constant `INTERVAL_SHIFT` which represents the number of bits to shift for calculating intervals.
3. The `INTERVALS` constant is defined as `(1UL << INTERVAL_SHIFT)`, which is a power-of-two value.
4. The `avg` and `stddev` variables are divided by `divisor` to calculate the averages and standard deviations, respectively.
5. The patch optimizes the division operation by using shifts instead of `do_div` when `divisor` is equal to `INTERVALS`.
6. By using shifts, the patch takes advantage of the fact that `INTERVALS` is usually a power-of-two, resulting in faster calculations.
7. The patch ensures that the division operation is still performed using `do_div` when `divisor` is not equal to `INTERVALS`.

false || Based on the provided information, the patch suggests removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` in the `ux500_pcm_open()` function of the `ux500_pcm.c` file. The reason given is that the driver never uses `snd_dmaengine_pcm_get_data()`, so there is no need to set the data using `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Impact: We need to assess the impact of removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()`. This function is responsible for setting the DMA configuration data for the given substream. If the driver does not rely on this data or if it can be set in another way, then the impact of removing this call may be minimal.

2. Code correctness: We should ensure that removing the call to `snd_dmaengine_pcm_set_data()` does not introduce any code correctness issues. It is important to review the surrounding code and verify that the removal does not break any dependencies or assumptions.

3. Testing: It is crucial to test the patched code thoroughly to ensure that it functions as expected and does not introduce any regressions or issues.

Based on the provided information, it is difficult to make a definitive decision without further analysis. However, if the impact is minimal, the code correctness is maintained, and the patch has been thoroughly tested, it may be reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the initialization of the spin lock in the ramoops driver. Currently, the spin_lock_init() function is called before the kmalloc() function, which allocates memory for cxt->pstore.buf. If the allocation fails, there is no need to initialize the spin lock.

The patch moves the spin_lock_init() function after the error checking, ensuring that the spin lock is only initialized when the memory allocation is successful.

This change improves the code's efficiency and correctness by avoiding unnecessary spin lock initialization when the memory allocation fails.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

3. The changes made in the patch are specific to the exynos-cpufreq.c file, which is responsible for handling the Exynos CPU frequency scaling. The modifications improve the error handling and logging in this file.

4. The patch introduces a new member, "dev," in the exynos_dvfs_info structure, which is used to store a reference to the device associated with the Exynos CPU frequency scaling. This reference is later used to display error messages with the correct device name.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to the codebase, enhancing error handling and logging in the Exynos CPU frequency scaling module. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()`. This change suggests that the patch is addressing a resource management issue related to clock handling.

2. The use of `devm_clk_get()` is preferred over `clk_get()` in newer kernel versions because it automatically handles resource management, eliminating the need for manual cleanup.

3. The patch modifies the `rsnd_ssi_probe()` function, replacing the call to `clk_get()` with `devm_clk_get()`. This ensures that the clock resource is properly managed and avoids potential resource leaks.

4. The patch also removes the call to `clk_put()` in the `rsnd_ssi_remove()` function. This is because `devm_clk_get()` automatically handles the cleanup, making the explicit call to `clk_put()` unnecessary.

Overall, the patch improves resource management by using `devm_clk_get()` and eliminates the need for manual cleanup. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch marks the functions `_raid_page_alloc` and `_raid_page_free` as static in the `exofs/ore_raid.c` file. This is done because these functions are not used outside of this file. 

Additionally, the patch resolves the warning messages related to missing prototypes for these functions. 

Overall, marking these functions as static improves code organization and eliminates warnings, making it a suitable change for inclusion in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for the interrupt mode at the beginning of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function. This check ensures that the subsequent ring count validations are only performed when the interrupt mode is MSI-X. This is important because the patch mentions that there is no RSS/TSS support in non MSI-X mode. This check helps avoid unnecessary validations in non MSI-X mode.

2. The patch also optimizes the ring count validations by skipping them if the ring counts are not going to change. This optimization can improve the performance of the `qlcnic_set_channels()` function by avoiding unnecessary validations when the ring counts remain the same.

3. The patch removes the RSS/TSS support check from the `qlcnic_validate_rings()` function in `qlcnic_main.c`. This check was previously performed in `qlcnic_set_channels()`. Removing this check from `qlcnic_validate_rings()` is reasonable since the interrupt mode check in `qlcnic_set_channels()` already ensures that the function is not called in non MSI-X mode.

Overall, the patch improves the efficiency of ring count validations and ensures that they are only performed when necessary. It also removes redundant checks from `qlcnic_validate_rings()`. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward code cleanup. The patch removes unnecessary Out-of-Memory (OOM) error messages that duplicate the generic OOM message from the MM subsystem.

false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze the changes made by the patch:

1. The patch modifies the function `beiscsi_post_pages` in `be_main.c` file.
2. It adds a loop to iterate through the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) numbers.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the ULP is supported by the firmware configuration.
4. If the ULP is supported, it breaks the loop.
5. It calculates the page offset based on the ULP number and other parameters.
6. It then iterates through the memory descriptors and performs some operations.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is fixing an issue related to the initialization of SGL (Scatter-Gather List) and page posting for the chute. It ensures that the SGL and page posting are done correctly based on the configuration value of each chute.

Considering the nature of the patch and the fact that it fixes a specific issue, it is likely that this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). However, it is important to further review the patch for any potential side effects or conflicts with other parts of the codebase before making a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to improve the jack connection decision logic for the nau8825 ASoC codec driver.
2. The original design only covers the case where the jack insertion logic is active low. The patch adds conditions to cover both active low and active high jack insertion logic.
3. The patch introduces two new variables, "active_high" and "is_high," to handle the active high jack insertion logic.
4. The patch reads the value of the JACK_DET_CTRL register to determine the polarity of the jack insertion logic.
5. The "active_high" variable is set based on the value of the JACK_DET_CTRL register.
6. The "is_high" variable is set based on the value of the GPIO2JD1 bit in the I2C_DEVICE_ID register.
7. The patch then compares the "active_high" and "is_high" variables to determine the jack connection status.
8. The patch ensures that the jack connection status is returned correctly based on the jack insertion logic, whether it is active high or active low.
9. The patch does not introduce any new issues or potential regressions.

false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward improvement to the mc13892 regulator driver in the Linux kernel. The patch suggests using the `regulator_map_voltage_ascend` function for both `mc13892_sw1` and `mc13892_sw` voltage tables, which have an ascending voltage list.

Considering that the patch does not introduce any new functionality or modify existing behavior, it seems safe to include it in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, it appears that the patch adds a flag for devices that can support runtime PM in the sdhci-pci driver. The flag is used to only allow runtime PM for devices that explicitly indicate support for it. 

The patch modifies the sdhci_pci_fixes structure by adding a new boolean field called "allow_runtime_pm". This field is set to true for specific sdhci_pci_fixes instances, indicating that runtime PM is allowed for those devices. 

In the sdhci_pci_probe function, the patch checks if the chip's fixes field is not NULL, and if so, it sets the chip's quirks and allow_runtime_pm fields based on the fixes. 

Furthermore, in the sdhci_pci_probe function, if the chip's allow_runtime_pm field is true, it calls the sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_allow function to allow runtime PM for the device. 

In the sdhci_pci_remove function, if the chip's allow_runtime_pm field is true, it calls the sdhci_pci_runtime_pm_forbid function to forbid runtime PM for the device. 

Based on this analysis, it seems that the patch is introducing a new feature to selectively enable runtime PM for devices that support it. This feature can be useful for power management purposes. 

Therefore, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward and necessary update to improve the accuracy and clarity of the "micd-timeout" property in the extcon-arizona driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. The patch is titled "ASoC: delay the initial jack detect by debounce_time." It suggests delaying the initial jack detection by a specified debounce time to allow the hardware to initialize and debounce.

2. The patch includes two signed-off-by lines, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the authors.

3. In the code changes, at line 342, the initial jack status update is modified. Instead of immediately detecting the jack status using `snd_soc_jack_gpio_detect()`, the patch introduces a delayed work scheduling using `schedule_delayed_work()`.

4. The delayed work is scheduled for each GPIO in the `gpios` array, using the `debounce_time` value specified in the `gpios` structure. The `msecs_to_jiffies()` function is used to convert the debounce time from milliseconds to jiffies.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). The patch introduces a delay in the initial jack detection, allowing the hardware to initialize and debounce properly. This can help improve the reliability and accuracy of jack detection in ASoC (Audio System on Chip) devices.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes the definition of pgprot_writecombine() for MIPS architecture. It addresses an issue where the generic code tries to provide a default implementation by defining pgprot_writecombine as pgprot_noncached, but the MIPS implementation is an inline function and not a #define.

2. The patch adds a #define statement "#define pgprot_writecombine pgprot_writecombine" to prevent the generic code from redefining it.

3. The patch is signed-off by the author, Alex Smith, and also has a sign-off from Ralf Baechle, indicating their agreement with the changes.

4. The patch has been submitted to the Linux MIPS mailing list for review and has a Patchwork link for further reference.

Based on these points, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the issue and has undergone review. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch hardcodes the clock event rating for the CMT to 125. This change is made to ensure that all boards use or should use the same clock event rating for the CMT.

2. The clock event device structure is updated to set the rating to 125.

3. The sh_cmt_register_clockevent function is modified to remove the rating parameter and set the rating directly to 125.

4. The sh_cmt_register function is updated to pass a boolean value (true) instead of the clock event rating. This change indicates that clock event registration is required.

5. The sh_cmt_setup_channel function is modified to pass the boolean value (true) to the sh_cmt_register function, indicating that clock event registration is required.

Overall, this patch ensures that the clock event rating for the CMT is consistently set to 125 across all boards. It simplifies the code by removing the need for a rating parameter and ensures that the clock event registration is always performed.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the function `snd_array_new` in the file `sound/pci/hda/hda_codec.c`. The purpose of the patch is to drop the explicit `memset()` call and instead use the `__GFP_ZERO` flag when reallocating memory with `krealloc()`.

The `snd_array_new` function is responsible for allocating memory for an array structure. If the current number of elements in the array (`array->used`) exceeds the allocated size (`array->alloced`), the function reallocates memory to accommodate more elements.

In the original code, after reallocating memory, there is an explicit `memset()` call to zero out the newly allocated memory. However, the patch removes this `memset()` call and instead uses the `__GFP_ZERO` flag when calling `krealloc()`. The `__GFP_ZERO` flag ensures that the newly allocated memory is already zeroed out.

By using the `__GFP_ZERO` flag, the patch eliminates the need for an explicit `memset()` call, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory operations.

Therefore, considering the patch's purpose of improving performance and the fact that it does not introduce any new issues, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a new line of code to read the CPUID(1).EAX leaf at the correct CPU and store it in the `csig->sig` variable. This information is used later in the code.

2. The patch does not introduce any functionality changes. It only adds a necessary step to collect CPU information.

3. The patch includes a `Signed-off-by` line from the original author and a `Link` to the patch discussion on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML).

4. The patch modifies the `collect_cpu_info_amd` function to read the CPUID(1).EAX leaf and store it in `csig->sig`.

5. The patch modifies the `find_equiv_id` function to use the `csig->sig` value instead of calling `cpuid_eax(0x00000001)` again.

6. The patch ensures that the `equiv_cpu_table` is not NULL before proceeding with the search.

7. The patch uses the `uci` variable to access the `cpu_sig.sig` value instead of calling `cpuid_eax(0x00000001)` again.

8. The patch does not introduce any new bugs or issues.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid and necessary addition to the Linux kernel code. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug where `ieee802154_llsec_parse_key_id()` was not being called due to a missing return statement. The patch adds the missing return statement, which returns `-EINVAL` if certain attributes are not present, and returns `-ENOBUFS` if `ieee802154_llsec_parse_key_id()` fails.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a bug fix rather than an enhancement or new feature. It addresses a specific issue and does not introduce any new functionality. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug introduced in commit 6820fead, which added support for multiple ranges in the msi-available-ranges property but miscalculated the MSIR index when multiple ranges are used.

2. The patch correctly updates the index calculation in the fsl_msi_setup_hwirq() function, ensuring that the index is set correctly for each range.

3. The patch also handles the case where the msi-available-ranges property is not defined by using the all_avail array and setting the length accordingly.

4. The patch iterates over each range and sets up the hardware IRQs correctly, taking into account the offset and the index.

Overall, the patch addresses a specific bug and ensures that the MSI ranges are handled correctly. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the change is modifying the platform_name field in the n810_dai structure. The patch suggests using "omap-mcbsp.2" as the platform name instead of "omap-pcm-audio". 

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Impact: The patch seems to be a specific fix for the n810 platform, which suggests that it may not have a significant impact on other platforms. However, it is essential to verify if this change could potentially affect other platforms using the same code.

2. Bug Fix: The patch does not explicitly mention any bug or issue it addresses. It appears to be a change to align the platform name with the cpu_dai name. It is crucial to understand the motivation behind this change and whether it resolves any known issues or improves functionality.

3. Testing: It is essential to ensure that the patch has been thoroughly tested on the n810 platform to verify that it does not introduce any regressions or compatibility issues.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive decision. However, if the patch is specific to the n810 platform, has been tested extensively, and does not introduce any regressions, it could be considered for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, my initial recommendation would be to give this patch an ACK. However, further investigation and review by the appropriate maintainers would be necessary to make a final decision.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` after enabling or disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin in the `wm8958_mic_detect` function.

2. The comment in the patch suggests that this change will have no effect during system startup, as detection is already set up before DAPM syncs take effect. However, it can be useful if the system enables and disables detection at runtime.

3. The added call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` ensures that the DAPM (Dynamic Audio Power Management) framework is synchronized after enabling or disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin. This synchronization ensures that any changes made to the DAPM state are properly applied.

4. The patch also includes a call to `snd_soc_dapm_sync(&codec->dapm)` after disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin, ensuring that the DAPM state is updated accordingly.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid improvement to ensure proper synchronization of the DAPM state when enabling or disabling the "CLK_SYS" pin during runtime. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a sparse warning in the cx25821 driver code. Sparse is a static code analysis tool for the Linux kernel, and fixing warnings from it is generally considered a good practice.

2. The warning is related to an incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces). This indicates a potential issue with memory access.

3. The patch modifies the code at line 334 in cx25821-video-upstream.c. It replaces the memcpy function call with a copy_from_user function call.

4. The copy_from_user function is used to safely copy data from user space to kernel space, ensuring proper memory access and avoiding security vulnerabilities.

5. The patch also includes proper error handling by returning -EFAULT if the copy_from_user function fails.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to address a potential issue and improves the code's safety and stability. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the mma8450 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch adds a missing call to `i2c_set_clientdata()` in the `mma8450_probe()` function. This is necessary to properly set the client data for the I2C device, which is later used in the `mma8450_remove()` function.

Considering that the patch fixes a potential issue where `i2c_get_clientdata()` could return NULL, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch addresses an issue where the return type of the function `ltr501_match_samp_freq()` is incorrectly defined as `unsigned int` despite the fact that it can return a negative error code. The patch corrects this by changing the return type to `int`, which is more appropriate for error handling.

The patch has also been reviewed and Acked-by two individuals, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Therefore, considering the nature of the issue and the approval from the reviewers, it is recommended to include this patch in the Linux -stable releases.
false || This patch is a simple renaming of a function in the rtl8192e driver. The function `rtl8192_process_phyinfo` is being renamed to `_rtl92e_process_phyinfo`. 

Based on the provided information, this patch appears to be a straightforward code cleanup and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any known issues. Therefore, it can be considered a non-essential change.

Considering that this patch is for the staging directory, which contains drivers that are not yet considered stable, it is not necessary to include this patch in the stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend giving this patch a (B) NAK and not accepting it in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch is a simple renaming of two repository routines in the powerpc/ps3 code. The old names, `modify_repository_node_value` and `remove_repository_node`, are being replaced with `write_repository_node` and `delete_repository_node`, respectively. 

This change appears to be a straightforward and non-disruptive modification that improves code clarity and consistency. It does not introduce any new functionality or alter the behavior of existing code. Therefore, it is safe to include in stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds missing calls to `ib_umem_release()` in the `nes_reg_user_mr()` function.
2. The `ib_umem_release()` function is responsible for releasing the resources associated with an `ib_umem` object.
3. The patch ensures that if `ib_copy_from_udata()` fails, the `ib_umem_release()` function is called before returning an error.
4. This addition of `ib_umem_release()` in the error-handling code improves the cleanup process and prevents resource leaks.
5. The patch also adds an additional call to `ib_umem_release()` before returning an error in the default case of the `switch` statement.
6. This ensures that the `ib_umem` object is properly released in all possible code paths.

Overall, the patch improves the error handling and resource management in the `nes_reg_user_mr()` function. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is for the blackfin architecture and specifically addresses the DMA (Direct Memory Access) functionality. The changes made in the patch involve removing the lines that set the current count values to zero for both x and y counts in the enable_dma() function.

The reason for removing these lines is not explicitly mentioned in the patch description. However, based on the context and the fact that the current count registers are marked as read-only, it can be inferred that setting them to zero is unnecessary and potentially incorrect.

By removing these lines, the patch simplifies the code and ensures that the DMA channel is properly enabled by setting the DMAEN flag in the cfg register.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid improvement that addresses a potential issue with the DMA functionality on the blackfin architecture. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of Intel(R) Trace Hub PCI ID for Broxton SOC. This patch adds support for the Broxton SOC in the intel_th driver.

Considering that the patch is adding support for a specific hardware device, it is unlikely to introduce any regressions or compatibility issues. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch removes an unnecessary check before calling the function "usb_put_dev". The usb_put_dev() function already checks if its argument is NULL and returns immediately, so the additional check is redundant. Removing this unnecessary check improves code readability and efficiency.

Additionally, the patch has been signed-off by both Markus Elfring and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Therefore, the patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch appears to be a simple fix for a checkpatch.pl error related to a space before a closing parenthesis. The patch removes the space before the closing parenthesis in the defined macros.

Considering that this patch only addresses a coding style issue and does not introduce any functional changes or bug fixes, it can be considered a cosmetic change. Cosmetic changes are generally not accepted in stable releases unless they are fixing a significant issue or improving code readability.

Therefore, I would recommend classifying this patch as (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch removes the unnecessary calls to usb_get_dev() and usb_put_dev() in the .probe and .disconnect functions of the usbnet:cdc-phonet driver. 

In the .probe function, the usb_get_dev() call is unnecessary because the reference count of the parent usb_device is already held during the .probe of the usb_interface instance. Therefore, removing this call does not introduce any issues.

In the .disconnect function, the usb_put_dev() call is also unnecessary because the usb_device pointer is not used after unregistering the network device and releasing the interface. Removing this call simplifies the code without causing any adverse effects.

Overall, the patch removes unnecessary code and does not introduce any functional changes or issues. Hence, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). 

The patch removes the unused OZ_MAX_TIMER_POOL_SIZE macro, which is not used anywhere in the codebase. Removing unused code improves code maintainability and reduces potential bugs or confusion. Since the macro is not being utilized, its removal does not introduce any functional changes or regressions. Therefore, it is safe to include this patch in the stable release.
false || Based on the provided patch, the change is a simple update to the author's email address in the MODULE_AUTHOR field. This change does not affect the functionality or stability of the code. Therefore, it can be considered a trivial change and can be accepted in Linux -stable releases. 

So, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the duplicate "const" keyword in the definition of "txsrc" is being removed. This change fixes a sparse warning and does not affect the functionality of the code.

Considering that the patch is fixing a warning and does not introduce any new issues, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, the answer is (A) ACK.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the variable 'err' is not initialized in the !CONFIG_IPV6 case of the 'netpoll_setup' function in net/core/netpoll.c. This results in a warning about the variable potentially being used uninitialized.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Severity of the issue: The warning indicates a potential use of an uninitialized variable, which can lead to undefined behavior or unexpected results. While it may not cause immediate crashes or security vulnerabilities, it is still a bug that should be addressed.

2. Impact on functionality: The uninitialized variable 'err' is used to handle error conditions in the code. If left uninitialized, it could lead to incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior when IPv6 is not supported. This could potentially impact the stability and reliability of the network polling functionality.

3. Risk of regression: The patch itself is relatively simple and addresses the issue by initializing 'err' to -EINVAL in the !CONFIG_IPV6 case. It does not introduce any new code or complex changes that could potentially introduce regressions or new bugs.

Based on these considerations, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential bug and improves the reliability of the netpoll functionality when IPv6 is not supported.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to streamline the rx buffer allocation in the ixgbevf driver.
2. It moves the allocation of the local variable `skb` to the section where it is needed, which improves code readability and maintainability.
3. It removes an unnecessary if statement that checks if `skb` is already allocated. Since `skb` is assigned a new value in the subsequent code block, the check is redundant.
4. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Tested-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by relevant individuals.
5. The changes made in the patch do not introduce any new functionality or behavior, but rather optimize the existing code.

Overall, the patch appears to be a clean and straightforward improvement to the ixgbevf driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the rationale:

1. The patch addresses a typo in the original commit where the contrast value was set incorrectly as 0x80 instead of 0x08. This indicates that the original commit contained an error that needs to be corrected.

2. The patch incorporates feedback from an end user, suggesting that a contrast value of 0x10 is more suitable due to the default backlight being less than 100%. This indicates that the patch improves the functionality and usability of the driver.

3. The patch has been reviewed by two individuals, Tony Prisk and Jean-Christophe Plagniol-Villard, who have signed off on it. This indicates that the patch has undergone some level of scrutiny and validation.

4. The change made by the patch is localized to the `wm8505fb.c` file, specifically in the `wm8505fb_probe` function. This suggests that the patch is not likely to have unintended side effects or impact other parts of the kernel.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is specific to the ARM architecture and targets the mx6quad variant. It adds a check to avoid a warning message that occurs when trying to disable the 1.2GHz OPP (Operating Performance Point) on a mx6solo variant, which does not support this frequency.

The patch modifies the `imx6q_opp_check_speed_grading` function in the `mach-imx6q.c` file. It checks the value of `val` against `OCOTP_CFG3_SPEED_1P2GHZ` and disables the 1.2GHz OPP if the value is not equal to it. However, the check is only performed if the CPU is of type mx6q (mx6quad).

By adding the `cpu_is_imx6q()` check, the patch ensures that the warning message is only triggered on the appropriate mx6quad variant, preventing unnecessary warnings on other variants like mx6solo.

Considering the patch's purpose of avoiding a warning message and its targeted check for the mx6quad variant, it appears to be a valid and necessary fix. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix related to the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel. The patch clears the hidden CPU state at reset time by setting the `vcpu->arch.hflags` value to 0.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the tda998x_irq_thread() function in the tda998x_drv.c file. It introduces a new boolean variable called "handled" to track whether the interrupt was handled or not.

The patch then updates the code to set "handled" to true when certain conditions are met. Specifically, if the flag2 bit INT_FLAGS_2_EDID_BLK_RD is set and priv->wq_edid_wait is true, the patch wakes up the wait queue and sets "handled" to true. Similarly, if the cec variable is not zero, indicating a HPD change, the patch schedules a delayed work and sets "handled" to true.

Finally, instead of always returning IRQ_HANDLED, the patch returns IRQ_RETVAL(handled), which allows reporting whether the interrupt was handled or not.

This patch improves the reporting mechanism by accurately indicating whether the interrupt was handled or not. This information can be useful for diagnosing and recovering from stuck-IRQ problems, preventing the kernel from locking up.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the file `fs/proc/kcore.c` in the Linux kernel. The change is to replace the usage of `strncpy` with `strlcpy` for copying the `saved_command_line` string into `prpsinfo.pr_psargs`.

The reason for this change is that `strncpy` does not guarantee null-termination of the destination string if the source string is longer than the specified length. This can lead to potential buffer overflows or incorrect behavior when working with NUL-terminated strings.

By using `strlcpy` instead, the destination string `prpsinfo.pr_psargs` is guaranteed to be null-terminated, regardless of the length of the source string. This ensures proper handling and avoids potential issues.

The patch has been signed-off by multiple contributors, including Linus Torvalds, which indicates that it has undergone review and approval by the relevant parties.

Therefore, considering the importance of proper string handling and the approval from the kernel maintainers, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

3. The patch also introduces a new variable "val" to store the value read from the AD_FIFO_REG register.
4. The value stored in "val" is then passed to comedi_buf_write_samples() to add it to the buffer.
5. Finally, the comedi_handle_events() function is called to handle any events related to the device.

Overall, the patch improves the code by using the recommended function comedi_buf_write_samples() and properly handling the sample value. It does not introduce any new issues or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a bug fix for the staging/rdma/hfi1 driver in the Linux kernel. The patch ensures that only devices with active links are selected when looking for or validating a user device. 

The patch introduces a new function called `usable_device` which checks if the device is available for general use by verifying if the driver link state is active. This function is then used in the `get_user_context` and `find_shared_ctxt` functions to filter out devices that are not active.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds the function `ioremap_nocache` to the CRIS architecture's `ioremap.c` file. This function is used to map physical addresses to virtual addresses for memory-mapped I/O operations.

2. The function `ioremap_nocache` takes two parameters: `phys_addr` (the physical address to be mapped) and `size` (the size of the memory region to be mapped).

3. The function uses the existing `__ioremap` function to perform the actual mapping. It sets the `MEM_NON_CACHEABLE` flag to ensure that the mapped memory region is not cached.

4. The `EXPORT_SYMBOL` macro is used to export the `ioremap_nocache` symbol, making it available for other modules to use.

5. The `iounmap` function, which is already present in the code, is not modified by this patch.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid addition to the CRIS architecture's `ioremap.c` file. It introduces a new function that can be useful for memory-mapped I/O operations and exports it for other modules to use. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

However, it is necessary to call these functions whenever the em28xx-v4l extension is closed, even if the device is still opened by some users.

2. The patch correctly moves the calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() to the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function, which is responsible for cleaning up resources when the em28xx-v4l extension is closed.

3. The warning message in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function has been modified to reflect that memory deallocation is deferred on the last close, rather than deregistration.

4. The calls to v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() and v4l2_device_unregister() in the em28xx_v4l2_close() function have been removed since they are now handled in the em28xx_v4l2_fini() function.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug in the current implementation and ensures that the necessary functions are called when the em28xx-v4l extension is closed. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The removal of `hfi1_query_qp` seems to be a clean-up change, as it is no longer necessary and can be replaced by an existing function. The patch does not introduce any new functionality or fix any bugs.

Considering this, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK) as it removes unnecessary code and improves code maintainability.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue related to accessing the tty circular buffer in the TX DMA interrupt after it is reset. The problem occurs when the kernel reboots, and the tty circular buffer is reset before the last TX DMA interrupt is called. In this scenario, the buffer tail is updated in the TX DMA interrupt handler, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

The patch modifies the code to prevent updating the buffer tail if it is reset. It checks if the circular buffer is empty before updating the tail. If the buffer is not empty, the tail is updated as before. Additionally, it includes a check for the number of pending characters in the circular buffer and wakes up the UART if necessary.

The patch is signed-off by Sonic Zhang and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed solution, it appears to be a valid fix for the problem. Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases.

false || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to declare the `exynos_drm_crtc_ops` structures as const. This change is justified because these structures are only passed as an argument to the function `exynos_drm_crtc_create`, which expects a `const struct exynos_drm_crtc_ops *` argument. Therefore, declaring the structures as const is appropriate.

The patch uses Coccinelle to make the necessary changes. It identifies the existing `exynos_drm_crtc_ops` structures and adds the const qualifier to them. The patch also updates the `decon_crtc_ops` structure to be const.

The patch includes the file size changes before and after the modification, indicating that the constification does not introduce any significant size increase.

The patch is signed-off by Bhumika Goyal and Daniel Vetter, and it includes a link to the patch message on the patchwork website.

Based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The motivation for this change is mentioned in the patch description, stating that a follow-up patch would make the main match function too large. By moving the rateinfo initialization to a separate helper function, the main match function can be kept more concise and maintainable.

The `rateinfo_init` function initializes the `rateinfo` structure with appropriate values based on the configuration provided in `hinfo`. It sets the `prev` field to the current jiffies value, calculates the `credit` and `cost` values using the `avg` and `burst` configuration parameters, and sets the `credit_cap` field to the same value as `credit`.

In the `hashlimit_mt` function, the `rateinfo_init` function is called instead of directly initializing the `rateinfo` structure. This change ensures that the `rateinfo` structure is consistently initialized in a centralized manner.

Overall, this patch improves code organization and maintainability without introducing any functional changes. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
false || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a straightforward addition of a new function `dso__last_symbol()` in `symbol.c` and its corresponding declaration in `symbol.h`.

false || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch increases the tx abort timeout for half/quarter channels in the ath9k_hw_abort_tx_dma() function.
2. It introduces a new variable "maxdelay" and initializes it to 1000.
3. If the current channel is a half-rate channel, the "maxdelay" variable is multiplied by 2. If it is a quarter-rate channel, the variable is multiplied by 4.
4. The patch then uses the updated "maxdelay" value in the for loop to determine the number of iterations.
5. Previously, the for loop had a fixed iteration count of 1000, but now it uses the calculated "maxdelay" value.
6. Inside the loop, there is a udelay(5) call, which introduces a delay of 5 microseconds between iterations.

Overall, this patch adjusts the tx abort timeout based on the channel rate, allowing for more time in case of slower channels. This change seems reasonable and should improve the stability and reliability of the ath9k driver. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue where errors in add_probe_trace_event() are not passed to debuginfo__find_trace_events(). This can lead to a segmentation fault if perf fails to find an argument for a probe point matched by the glob.

The patch ensures that add_probe_trace_event() does not modify tf->ntevs and tf->tevs if the function fails. This prevents potential issues and maintains the stability of the system.

The patch also includes a clear_probe_trace_event() function to handle the failure case, freeing up resources and decrementing tf->ntevs.

The patch has been tested and reviewed by multiple individuals, including Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo and Alexei Starovoitov, which adds credibility to its effectiveness.

Considering the nature of the issue and the provided solution, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to improve stability and prevent potential crashes.

Therefore, my recommendation is to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a check for `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` in the `write_checkpoint` function of `checkpoint.c`. This ensures that the `s_dirty` flag is checked and the checkpoint is skipped if it is not set. This change improves the correctness of the code.

2. The previous condition was incorrect as it did not consider the scenario where a checkpoint was already done and all the node pages were written back. The patch addresses this issue by introducing the check for `s_dirty` before proceeding with the checkpoint.

3. The `out` label is added to skip the checkpoint if `s_dirty` is not set. This improves the readability and maintainability of the code.

4. In `super.c`, the patch removes the unnecessary check for `s_dirty` and `get_pages` in the `f2fs_sync_fs` function. Since the `write_checkpoint` function already checks for `s_dirty`, this redundant check is removed.

Overall, the patch improves the correctness and efficiency of the code by properly checking `s_dirty` under `cp_mutex` and removing redundant checks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism. It introduces a ratelimiting mechanism to prevent a flood of warning messages from being generated when something goes wrong. This is beneficial as the excessive generation of these messages does not help the condition.

The patch acknowledges that there is an underlying problem in usbnet's kevent deferral mechanism, which causes events to be dropped and not handled. However, it does not directly address this issue. Instead, it focuses on mitigating the fallout caused by the current implementation.

The patch modifies the `usbnet_defer_kevent` function by adding a ratelimit check before printing the warning message. If the ratelimit is not exceeded, the warning message is printed. Otherwise, it is suppressed. This helps prevent the flooding of warning messages and provides a more controlled output.

Overall, the patch improves the behavior of usbnet by reducing the excessive warning messages without introducing any significant changes to the underlying issue. Therefore, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific problem: The current driver sets the request's DMA address as 0 to mark it as invalid, but some gadget drivers set it to DMA_ADDR_INVALID. This inconsistency leads to incorrect data transmission.

2. The patch fixes the problem by using DMA_ADDR_INVALID instead of 0 to mark the request's DMA address as invalid. This ensures consistency and prevents bogus data transmission.

3. The patch has been tested and verified by Pavankumar Kondeti <pkondeti@codeaurora.org>, indicating that it has undergone testing and is likely to be reliable.

4. The patch includes signed-off-by statements from multiple contributors, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to reduce the memory footprint for debugging in the DRM Radeon driver. It suggests replacing the usage of hex_dump_to_buffer() with a kernel helper function, printk(), which can dump up to 64 bytes. In this case, the actual size is only 15 bytes.

The existing code uses hex_dump_to_buffer() to print the DPCD (DisplayPort Configuration Data) in hexadecimal format. However, since the size is known and fixed, the patch proposes using the %*ph format specifier in printk() to achieve the same result.

By making this change, the patch eliminates the need for the dpcd_hex_dump buffer and reduces memory usage. The new code is more concise and efficient.

Considering the benefits of reducing memory usage and the simplicity of the proposed change, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The patch initializes the 'ret' variable to -ENOMEM, which is the error code for out-of-memory conditions.

3. The patch checks if genlmsg_new fails to allocate a new sk_buff and returns the 'ret' value (-ENOMEM) if it fails.

4. The patch checks if genlmsg_put fails to add the message header to the sk_buff and jumps to the 'free_skb' label to free the sk_buff and return the 'ret' value (-ENOMEM) if it fails.

5. The patch uses nla_put_string and nla_put_u32 to add attributes to the sk_buff. If any of these functions fail, the patch jumps to the 'free_skb' label to free the sk_buff and return the 'ret' value (-ENOMEM).

6. The patch checks if genlmsg_end fails to finalize the message and jumps to the 'free_skb' label to free the sk_buff and return the 'ret' value if it fails.

7. Finally, the patch returns the 'ret' value, which is either the error code or 0 if the function executed successfully.

The patch addresses the unused return smatch warnings and handles error conditions properly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a minor cleanup for the FRAC_BITS value in the cpufreq intel_pstate driver. The patch fixes the issue of hardcoding the value and instead uses the FRAC_BITS macro. 

Since this patch is a cleanup and does not introduce any new functionality or fix any critical issues, it can be considered a low-risk change. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an overflow condition in the pool_find_page() function of the dmapool module. When a DMA pool is located at the top of the dma_addr_t range, the calculated end address of the pool wraps around to zero, causing page lookup to always fail.

The patch modifies the calculation in question to be overflow-proof. Instead of comparing the DMA address directly with the sum of the page's DMA address and the pool's allocation, it subtracts the page's DMA address from the given DMA address and compares the result with the pool's allocation.

This modification ensures that the comparison is not affected by potential overflow issues, allowing correct page lookup even when the DMA pool is at the top of the dma_addr_t range.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Robin Murphy, Andrew Morton, and Linus Torvalds. It also includes relevant Cc's to other developers involved in the affected code.

3. The __detach_context() function is modified to release the Problem State Area mapping by unmap_mapping_range() if the mapping exists.

4. The cxl_context structure is extended to include the new mapping and mapping_lock fields.

5. The cxl_context_init() function is updated to accept the new mapping parameter.

6. The __afu_open() function in file.c is modified to pass the inode's mapping to cxl_context_init().

7. The afu_release() function in file.c is modified to set the mapping field to NULL, indicating that the mapping is no longer valid.

true || Based on the provided patch, the correct answer is (B) should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases (NAK).

Here's the analysis:

The patch description states that the check of the return value from __find_format() was inverted by mistake. Looking at the code changes, we can see that the condition `if (!format)` has been changed to `if (format)`. This means that the code logic has been reversed.

In the original code, if `format` is not found (i.e., `!format`), the `fmt->format` is assigned the value of `*format`. However, in the patched code, if `format` is found (i.e., `format`), `fmt->format` is assigned the value of `*format`. This is incorrect and will lead to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, this patch introduces a regression and should not be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, the Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

3. The patch also addresses another issue related to console writes happening unlocked when port->sysrq is not reset. It suggests introducing a separate indicator (port->sysrq_cpu) and modifying the locking check accordingly. While this solution goes beyond the scope of this fix, it is a necessary step to ensure proper locking behavior.

4. The patch has been reported and tested by Tim Sander and signed-off by Thomas Gleixner and Greg Kroah-Hartman, indicating that it has undergone review and testing.

Considering these factors, accepting the patch would help resolve the recursive locking bug and improve the stability and reliability of the Linux kernel.
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that the patch is fixing a race condition in the netfilter nf_ct_h323 module. The current implementation of mod_timer in the patch introduces a race condition where memory that has already been freed can be accessed when the timer expires again.

The suggested fix is to replace mod_timer with mod_timer_pending. This change should prevent the race condition by ensuring that the timer is not reactivated if it has already expired.

Considering the nature of the issue and the proposed fix, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a potential memory access issue and improves the stability of the netfilter nf_ct_h323 module.

7. The patch modifies the stmmac_main.c file, specifically the stmmac_suspend() and stmmac_resume() functions.
8. The patch initializes the DMA descriptor rings and performs other necessary setup operations during resume.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a more efficient solution without introducing any potential regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch aims to configure the firmware to pass beacons from foreign APs in AP mode. This is necessary to set the ht protection IE properly. It addresses a specific functionality requirement.

2. The patch adds the same filters for Group Owner (GO) mode, which were missing previously. This indicates that the omission of filters for GO mode was likely a mistake.

3. The patch modifies the filter_flags field in the command structure to include MAC_FILTER_IN_PROBE_REQUEST and MAC_FILTER_IN_BEACON. This enables passing probe requests and beacons from other APs, which is required for ht protection.

4. The patch also includes the necessary changes for GO mode, ensuring that the filter_flags modification is applied correctly.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific functionality requirement and fixes a potential oversight. It does not introduce any significant risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug related to F-RTO (Forward RTO-Recovery), which is a mechanism used in TCP to recover from spurious retransmissions. The bug causes F-RTO to incorrectly send more probes if the next ACK advances SND_UNA (the next sequence number expected to be acknowledged) and does not sack a new packet. This behavior can lead to the sender always sending new data instead of repairing holes, resulting in longer Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on the receiver for the application.

The patch modifies the code to correctly handle the F-RTO behavior. It checks if SND_NXT (the next sequence number to be sent) is greater than HIGH_SEQ (the highest sequence number sent so far). If it is, the patch checks if either the FLAG_DATA_SACKED or is_dupack flag is set. If either of these conditions is true, it sets FRTO to 0, indicating that the loss was real. This aligns with the correct behavior described in the F-RTO RFC 5682, which states that F-RTO should probe at most once.

Additionally, the patch also handles the case where FLAG_SND_UNA_ADVANCED is set and recovered is false. In this case, it updates HIGH_SEQ to SND_NXT and pushes pending frames.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug in the TCP F-RTO mechanism and ensures that it behaves correctly according to the RFC. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch reverts a previous commit that prevented unnecessary calls to prepare_fb and cleanup_fb functions in the DRM atomic drivers. The revert allows the driver to decide when these functions are noops, instead of handling all the special cases in the core.

The original commit mentioned that it prevented waiting in i915 on all previous rendering during cursor updates, but it was deemed that there are better ways to address this issue.

The patch has been signed-off by Maarten Lankhorst and Acked-by Laurent Pinchart, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering the information provided, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that implemented the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function in the "radeon_drv.c" file. The reason for reverting is that it causes a race condition between "drm_dev_unregister()" and "pci_driver.shutdown" during shutdown or driver unload time.

The comment suggests that there is a need to revisit how to properly support kexec within the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager). This indicates that the current implementation is problematic and needs further improvement.

By reverting the commit, the "radeon_pci_shutdown" function is removed, which eliminates the race condition. This is a necessary step to ensure stability and prevent potential issues during shutdown or driver unload.

Therefore, considering the race condition and the need for further improvement, accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases would be the appropriate course of action.
true || Based on the provided Linux kernel patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses an issue related to the estimation of Round Trip Time (RTT) in Fast Open for SYNACK packets.
2. The patch modifies the function `tcp_synack_rtt_meas()` to correctly compute the time elapsed between the SYNACK and the ACK completing the 3-way handshake.
3. The patch introduces a new variable `synack_stamp` to store the SYNACK timestamp.
4. If the `synack_stamp` is available and there are no total retransmissions, the patch calculates the sequence RTT using the difference between the current timestamp and the `synack_stamp`.
5. Additionally, the patch checks if the smooth RTT (`srtt`) is not set, indicating that the ACK acknowledges both the SYNACK and the Fast Open'd data packets sent in SYN_RECV. In this case, the patch calls `tcp_ack_update_rtt()` to update the RTT.
6. The patch is signed-off by multiple contributors, including Yuchung Cheng, Neal Cardwell, Eric Dumazet, and David S. Miller.

Based on the analysis, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and does not introduce any obvious regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch adds a reject condition for the MPC5121 platform if an input-only pin is requested to be set as an output. This ensures that the pin configuration is handled correctly, preventing any potential issues. This is a valid improvement for the MPC5121 platform.

2. The patch also optimizes the mach-specific quirk setup to consume fewer lines, which improves scalability. This is a positive change that can enhance the overall efficiency of the code.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and approved the changes.

4. The patch does not introduce any build errors, as mentioned in the commit message.

Overall, the patch addresses specific issues and improves the code's efficiency without introducing any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch allows the creation of zero-sized mm in the Nouveau DRM driver. This is useful in scenarios where a chipset may or may not have a specific resource, and it helps avoid the need for extensive checks for the mm's existence throughout the codebase.

2. The patch modifies the `nouveau_mm_init` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/core/mm.c`. It introduces a conditional check for the length parameter. If the length is non-zero, the offset and length calculations are performed as before. Otherwise, the offset and length values are not modified.

3. The patch also removes the `heap_size` member from the `struct nouveau_mm` in `drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/core/include/core/mm.h`. This suggests that the `heap_size` variable is no longer needed or used.

4. The patch has been signed-off by Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the author.

Based on the above analysis, the patch appears to be a reasonable and beneficial change that improves the Nouveau DRM driver. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: Deadlock with small NVMe-oF queue size (<32)
   Explanation: The patch addresses a deadlock issue that occurs when the queue size is less than 32. The IB completions are not sent until the queue reaches 32, causing the send queue to fill up.
   Solution: The patch changes the signaling mechanism to depend on the queue depth, removing the need for a magic define.

2. Error message: "nvme_rdma_post_send failed with error code -12"
   Explanation: The error message indicates a failure in the nvme_rdma_post_send function, which is resolved by this patch.

3. Code changes:
   - The patch introduces a new inline function, nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit, which calculates the signaling limit based on the queue depth.
   - The existing code snippet that handles signaling every 32 messages is replaced with a call to nvme_rdma_queue_sig_limit.
   - The patch ensures that flushes are always signaled to prevent freeing of the "wr_cqe" embedded in the request's payload.

Overall, the patch addresses a deadlock issue and improves the signaling mechanism for NVMe-oF devices with small queue sizes. It also removes a magic define and introduces a more flexible signaling approach based on the queue depth. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch replaces the usage of plain (HZ / 50) with msecs_to_jiffies(20). This change makes the code more explicit about the intended behavior, which is to schedule the task 20 milliseconds from now.

2. The change improves code readability and maintainability by using a dedicated function, msecs_to_jiffies(), to convert milliseconds to jiffies. This function ensures that the conversion is done correctly, taking into account the system's timer resolution.

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Marek Vasut and Viresh Kumar, indicating that it has undergone a thorough review process.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is related to the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem for ARM and ARM64 architectures. It addresses an issue with saving the state of list registers (LRS) in the vgic-v2 (Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller) code.

The patch ensures that when saving the state of the list registers, all dirty LRs are cleared to zero. This is important because failing to reset them to zero could result in unexpected EOI (End of Interrupt) interrupts pending for virtual level interrupts.

The patch modifies the `save_lrs` function in the `vgic-v2-sr.c` file. It iterates through the list registers and checks if they are live (used). If a register is live, it checks if the corresponding bit is set in the `vgic_elrsr` variable. If it is set, it clears the `GICH_LR_STATE` bit in the `vgic_lr` array. If it is not set, it reads the register value from memory and stores it in the `vgic_lr` array. Finally, it writes zero to the corresponding memory location.

The patch seems to address a specific issue related to saving the state of list registers in the vgic-v2 code. It is a targeted fix that ensures proper handling of dirty LRs and prevents pending interrupts. Since it addresses a specific issue and does not introduce any new risks or regressions, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where, if a port is unplugged while a user is blocked on read(), subsequent read() operations return 0 instead of -ENODEV, which does not indicate that the device went away. This can lead to situations where the user is unaware that the port has been unplugged.

The patch fixes this by returning -ENODEV on all read() operations after the port gets unplugged. This ensures that the user is notified of the unplugged port and can take appropriate action.

The change is straightforward and does not introduce any new functionality or potential regressions. It only modifies the behavior of the read() operation to return the correct error code when the port is unplugged.

Given that the patch addresses a bug and does not introduce any new issues, it is suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK).

true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: The patch addresses a deadlock issue between the chcp and thaw ioctls in the nilfs2 file system.
   - The deadlock occurs when the thaw ioctl is called while chcp is waiting at nilfs_transaction_begin().
   - The deadlock is 100% reproducible.

2. Explanation: The deadlock is caused by conflicting locks on sb->s_umount in nilfs_ioctl_change_cpmode() and thaw_super(). The intention of locking sb->s_umount was to make snapshot mounts and snapshot downgrades exclusive.

3. Solution: The patch replaces the usage of sb->s_umount with a dedicated mutex (ns_snapshot_mount_mutex) to protect snapshot mounts.

4. Code Changes: The patch modifies the following files:
   - fs/nilfs2/ioctl.c: Replaces the locking of sb->s_umount with mutex_lock and mutex_unlock.
   - fs/nilfs2/super.c: Adds mutex_lock and mutex_unlock around the relevant code section.
   - fs/nilfs2/the_nilfs.c: Initializes the ns_snapshot_mount_mutex.
   - fs/nilfs2/the_nilfs.h: Adds the ns_snapshot_mount_mutex field to the_nilfs structure.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch removes the use of BUG_ON() statements in the btrfs_map_block function. BUG_ON() statements are typically used to indicate a critical error condition that should never occur. However, in this case, the patch suggests that btrfs_map_block can encounter issues in the face of file system corruption. Therefore, it is reasonable to remove the BUG_ON() statements to avoid unnecessary panics.

2. The patch introduces error handling code in case the stripe math or stripe index calculations go wrong. It logs an error message and returns an appropriate error code (-EINVAL) instead of panicking. This is a more graceful way of handling potential errors and ensures that the system remains stable even in the face of corruption or incorrect calculations.

3. The patch includes proper sign-offs from the authors, indicating that they have reviewed and tested the changes.

Overall, the patch improves the error handling and stability of the btrfs_map_block function, making it suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue in the qla4xxx driver where the loop may continue indefinitely if qla4xxx_get_fwddb_entry returns QLA_ERROR. The current code uses the "continue" statement, which means it will skip the rest of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in this case, the "idx" variable is not updated, potentially causing the loop condition "idx < max_ddbs" to never be met.

The patch fixes this by explicitly incrementing "next_idx" in the error condition. This ensures that the loop will eventually terminate by incrementing the index and moving to the next iteration.

The patch also suggests using a "break" statement instead of "continue" to leave the decision on the qlogic maintainer. While this change is not strictly necessary for fixing the issue, it provides flexibility for future modifications.

Overall, the patch addresses a potential infinite loop issue and improves the code's clarity. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a NULL pointer dereference issue in the smp_conn_security() function in the net/bluetooth/smp.c file. The patch adds a check for a NULL pointer before accessing the chan variable, and if it is NULL, it logs an error message and returns 1.

The patch is necessary because the l2cap_conn->smp pointer can be NULL in certain valid scenarios where SMP (Security Manager Protocol) has failed to initialize properly. This can happen due to missing crypto support or when the adapter has been powered on through a legacy method.

By adding the NULL pointer check, the patch prevents potential NULL pointer dereferences and provides a more robust error handling mechanism.

Considering the importance of stability and preventing potential crashes or security vulnerabilities, it is recommended to include this patch in Linux -stable releases.

The patch addresses a specific issue in the powerpc specific nx-842 compression driver. Currently, the driver does not handle the translation of a vmalloc address to a physical address correctly. The patch introduces a new routine to convert an address to a physical address and handles vmalloc addresses properly.

The patch modifies the nx-842.c file in the drivers/crypto/nx/ directory. It adds a new function, nx842_get_pa(), which checks if the address is a vmalloc address using is_vmalloc_addr(). If it is a vmalloc address, it calculates the physical address using page_to_phys() and offset_in_page(). Otherwise, it falls back to using __pa().

The patch also modifies the nx842_build_scatterlist() function to use nx842_get_pa() instead of __pa() when setting the entry->ptr value. Similarly, the nx842_compress() and nx842_decompress() functions are modified to use nx842_get_pa() for setting op.csbcpb, op.out, op.in, and op.inlen values.

mac->tx->clean_timer.expires = jiffies+HZ;
add_timer(&mac->tx->clean_timer);
```

with:

```c
setup_timer(&mac->tx->clean_timer, pasemi_mac_tx_timer,
            (unsigned long)mac->tx);
mod_timer(&mac->tx->clean_timer, jiffies + HZ);
```

The patch aims to improve SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) balancing by avoiding select_idle_sibling() from picking a sibling thread if there is an idle core that shares cache. This fix addresses the issue of SMT balancing in scenarios where there is a shared cache core available for balancing.

The patch has been tested by Mike Galbraith and signed-off by Peter Zijlstra and Ingo Molnar. It also includes appropriate Cc's to relevant individuals.

The changes in the patch modify the select_idle_sibling() function in the kernel/sched_fair.c file. The modifications introduce a new variable 'smt' and a new label 'again' to handle the case where there is a shared cache core available. The patch iterates through the sched_domain structures and checks for the presence of shared CPU power. If shared CPU power is found, it continues to the next sched_group and checks for idle CPUs. If an idle CPU is found, it updates the target CPU and breaks the loop.

The patch appears to be well-tested and addresses a specific issue related to SMT balancing. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears that the patch aims to set queue limits for the admin queue in the NVMe driver. The patch introduces a helper function called `nvme_set_queue_limits` that sets various queue limits for the admin queue, such as maximum hardware sectors, maximum segments, chunk sectors, flush behavior, and virtual boundary.

Considering the purpose of the patch and the changes it introduces, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here are the reasons:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue related to the use of the in_irq() function in the intel_check_page_flip() function in the intel_display.c file of the i915 driver.

2. The in_irq() function only tests for hard-IRQ context, which can lead to warnings when the system is run with the 'threadirqs' option selected. This is because the intel_check_page_flip() function can be called in soft-IRQ context as well.

3. The patch suggests using the in_interrupt() function instead, which allows for either type of interrupt context and avoids the warnings generated by in_irq().

4. The patch includes a Bugzilla reference, indicating that the issue has been reported and tracked.

5. The patch has been reviewed by Daniel Vetter and signed-off by Dave Gordon and Jani Nikula, indicating that it has undergone peer review.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch aims to improve the power management functionality in the Radeon DRM driver. It replaces the manual lookup of the max_vddc value with a stored value, which is more efficient.

In both ni_parse_pplib_clock_info() and rv7xx_parse_pplib_clock_info() functions, the patch checks if the vddc value is set to 0xff01. If it is, instead of calling radeon_atom_get_max_vddc() to retrieve the value, it uses the stored max_vddc value from the power_info structure (pi->max_vddc).

This change eliminates the need for redundant lookups of the max_vddc value, improving performance and reducing unnecessary function calls.

Overall, the patch appears to be a straightforward optimization that improves efficiency without introducing any new risks or issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch is reverting a previous commit that enabled autosuspend for Intel Bluetooth devices. The reason for reverting is that enabling autosuspend has been found to be unreliable. It may work for some people with specific USB host controllers, but for others, it causes the device to sleep and not wake up for important events like HCI Inquiry Complete or HCI Connection Request.

The patch mentions that there were initial attempts to fix this issue for some people by patching the xHCI USB controller, but it didn't work for everyone. It suggests that the problem could be in the USB subsystem, USB host controllers, or even a hardware issue. Since the cause is unknown, the safest action is to revert the patch.

Considering the potential impact on device functionality and the lack of a reliable solution, it is reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to avoid potential issues for users.

Therefore, the answer is (A) should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference issue introduced in a previous commit. It explains that when waiting for the endpoint to be enabled, the functionfs_bind() has not been called yet, and the epfile->ffs->gadget is still NULL. The local 'gadget' variable is initialized with NULL at the point of its definition and later used as a parameter to usb_ep_align_maybe(gadget, ep->ep, len), which dereferences it.

To fix this issue, the patch moves the assignment of the 'gadget' variable after the potential waiting has completed. This ensures that the 'gadget' variable is assigned a non-NULL value before being used as a parameter.

The patch includes the necessary Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by the relevant contributors.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The h5_reset_rx() function frees the Rx skb, but not returning after that can lead to a kernel oops when h5_rx_payload() is called and tries to dereference a NULL Rx skb.

2. The patch adds a return statement after calling h5_reset_rx(h5), which prevents the subsequent h5_rx_payload() call from causing a kernel oops.

3. The change is relatively simple and localized to the h5_rx_3wire_hdr() function in the hci_h5.c file.

4. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by Loic Poulain and Marcel Holtmann, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to prevent potential kernel oopses.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the condition for considering double acknowledged interrupts in the `snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0` function in `pcm_lib.c`. The current condition checks if the hardware (HW) reported pointer is smaller than expected and if the time since the last update (hdelta) is over half a buffer time.

The patch addresses a specific scenario where the HW reported pointer is only slightly smaller than expected and hdelta is just slightly larger than half a buffer time (e.g., in a ping-pong buffer). In such cases, the current condition wrongly treats the interrupt as double acknowledged.

The patch adjusts the condition by adding 1 to `runtime->hw_ptr_buffer_jiffies/2`. This change ensures that even if there is a slight inaccuracy in the jiffies value, the condition will still correctly identify double acknowledged interrupts.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific issue and improves the accuracy of detecting double acknowledged interrupts. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch fixes a bug in the encoding of metadata. The current implementation uses the padded length instead of the real length, which is against the specification. This bug has not caused any issues so far because all specified metadata has been 32-bit, where aligned and data length are the same width. The patch corrects this behavior by using the real length.

2. The patch also includes a bug fix for validating the length of a u16 field. However, since there is no metadata of size u16, this fix is not relevant. Nevertheless, it is safe to include it.

3. The patch removes magic numbers, which improves code readability and maintainability.

4. The patch includes the necessary "Fixes" tag, indicating that it addresses a specific commit.

Overall, the patch addresses a bug and improves code quality without introducing any new issues. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to the ACPI Embedded Controller (EC) interrupt handling. Currently, if the advance_transaction() function is called in the EC interrupt handler and there is nothing the driver can do with the interrupt, it is considered a false one. However, this is not always accurate, as there may be a System Control Interrupt (SCI) EC interrupt fired during normal read/write operations, which should not be counted as a false one.

The patch modifies the error handling code in advance_transaction() to check if the SCI bit is set in the status variable. If the SCI bit is set, the patch ensures that the interrupt is not considered a false IRQ. This change prevents a not handled IRQ from being incorrectly classified as a false one.

Overall, the patch appears to address a specific issue and provides a more accurate handling of EC interrupts. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the calculate_imbalance() function in the sched/balancing module. The bug occurs when the condition `local->avg_load > sds->avg_load` is true, which can lead to an imbalance overflow and constant task bouncing between CPUs if there are pinned tasks.

The patch fixes this issue by skipping the assignment and assuming imbalance=0 when `local->avg_load > sds->avg_load`. This prevents the imbalance overflow and resolves the task bouncing problem.

The patch also includes a test case to reproduce the bug and verify the fix.

Overall, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and does not introduce any new risks or regressions. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

2. The issue arises when the MMU is disabled in ExitBootServices(), causing unaligned accesses to RAM to no longer be supported.
3. The patch moves the update_fdt_memmap() call into the callback function invoked by efi_exit_boot_services() right before it calls the ExitBootServices() UEFI service. This ensures that FDT manipulation occurs before the MMU is disabled, avoiding alignment faults.
4. The patch also highlights that disabling the MMU in ExitBootServices() is not compliant with the UEFI spec and carries great risk due to potential issues with switching from cached to uncached memory accesses.
5. The patch includes a Fixes tag, indicating that it addresses a specific issue introduced by a previous commit.
6. It has been tested and has a Tested-by tag from Riku Voipio.

The changes made in the patch are as follows:

1. In the "mixer_enable_vblank" function, the vsync interrupt is enabled by writing to the "MXR_INT_EN" register. The patch modifies this by also clearing the vsync indicator using the "MXR_INT_STATUS" register before enabling the interrupt.

2. In the "mixer_disable_vblank" function, the vsync interrupt is disabled by writing to the "MXR_INT_EN" register. The patch adds a line to clear the vsync indicator using the "MXR_INT_STATUS" register before disabling the interrupt.

3. In the "mixer_enable" function, the patch checks if the vsync interrupt is enabled in the context. If it is, the vsync indicator is cleared using the "MXR_INT_STATUS" register before enabling the interrupt.

Overall, the patch ensures that the vsync indicator is properly cleared before configuring vsync, which aligns with the specification. This correction improves the reliability and accuracy of vsync handling in the "drm/exynos/mixer" driver.

Therefore, I recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a bug in the btrfs file system where the fs_info->pending_changes variable is not properly cleared. The original code uses cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0), which only clears the variable if it is already 0. This can cause problems when mounting btrfs with the inode_cache mount option, as pending_changes will always be 1 even when the file system is frozen.

The patch modifies the code to use xchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0), which ensures that the variable is always cleared regardless of its previous value. This fix resolves the issue and prevents potential problems when using the inode_cache mount option.

The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by multiple developers, including Qu Wenruo, David Sterba, and Chris Mason. This indicates that the patch has undergone thorough review and testing.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. Purpose of the patch:
   The patch aims to handle cases where the BIOS native mode in mobile radeon systems may not be fully initialized or have default values. In such cases, if a panel with a reasonable EDID is available, the patch replaces the native mode with the panel's preferred mode if the resolutions don't match. Systems without a valid internal panel EDID will still use the BIOS native mode.

2. Patch implementation:
   The patch modifies the function `radeon_fixup_lvds_native_mode` in the `radeon_connectors.c` file. It introduces logic to check if the EDID preferred mode matches the native mode. If they don't match, the patch replaces the native mode with the preferred mode. Additionally, if the native mode details are not available from the EDID, the patch attempts to retrieve them from the probed modes.

3. Patch review:
   The patch has been reviewed by Matthew Garrett and Alex Deucher, who have provided their signed-off-by statements, indicating their approval of the patch.

4. Impact and justification:
   The patch addresses a corner case where the BIOS native mode may not accurately represent the panel capabilities. By allowing the panel's preferred mode to override the native mode, the patch ensures that the panel's capabilities are correctly reflected. This can improve the display experience on systems with problematic BIOS native modes.

true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

1. Issue: On heavy paging load, some guest CPUs enter a loop in gmap_ipte_notify, causing stalled CPUs inside the guest.
   - This issue affects the stability and performance of the system.

2. Cause: The gmap_ipte_notifier attempts to map a user page and ensure that the page table entry (pte) is valid and writable. However, due to the software change bit tracking, the pte can become read-only (and only software-writable) if the page is clean.
   - This causes the page to remain clean and never become writable again, leading to the loop in gmap_ipte_notify.

3. Solution: Instead of using gmap_ipte_notify, the patch suggests using fixup_user_fault, which guarantees a call to handle_mm_fault.
   - This change ensures that the page is handled correctly and avoids the loop in gmap_ipte_notify.

4. Patch details:
   - The patch modifies the gmap_ipte_notify function in arch/s390/mm/pgtable.c.
   - It replaces the get_user_pages call with fixup_user_fault, passing the current process, gmap->mm, addr, and FAULT_FLAG_WRITE as arguments.
   - If fixup_user_fault returns an error, indicating a fault, the function sets rc to -EFAULT and breaks the loop.

Considering the provided information, the patch addresses a specific issue and provides a solution that appears to be reasonable and targeted. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided information, I would recommend accepting this Linux kernel patch (ACK) for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a potential issue where the alpha value in the DCTCP (Data Center TCP) algorithm may never reach zero, even when it should. This can lead to uncongested flows being gradually driven down to a minimum congestion window size (cwnd=137). The patch modifies the code to ensure that alpha can drop to zero when it is strictly reduced by alpha >> dctcp_shift_g and when alpha is less than 1 << dctcp_shift_g.

The patch also mentions that the change from decrementing alpha by 1 to dropping it to 0 requires one less conditional to implement, as it avoids the need to guard against subtracting 1 from 0U. The decay of 15 for alpha is considered reasonable since an equal or greater amount occurs at alpha >= 240.

The patch has been reviewed and Acked-by Florian Westphal, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by another developer. It is also signed-off by Andrew G. Shewmaker and David S. Miller.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue in the intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() function in the intel_pstate.c file. The function currently calls intel_pstate_update_perf_limits(), which can cause global P-state limits to change. However, this behavior is unnecessary and confusing.

The patch removes the invocation of intel_pstate_update_perf_limits() from intel_cpufreq_verify_policy(). This change ensures that in passive mode, the global limits are only applied to the frequency selected by the scaling governor, aligning with user expectations. It also reduces code size by a few lines.

The patch does not affect the per-CPU limits case, as those limits allow any P-state to be set by default in passive mode. With this change, the per-policy settings will be the only ones taken into account in that case, as expected.

Overall, the patch fixes a specific issue and improves the behavior of the intel_cpufreq_verify_policy() function without introducing any new problems. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses an issue where the cleanup of MCGs (Multicast Groups) in MCG paravirtualization is performed in a work queue. However, there is a possibility that the ULP (Upper Layer Protocol) could leave and re-join groups before the cleanup occurs. This can lead to the ULP being left without actual MCGs while believing it joined them.

To fix this issue, the patch sets a flushing flag before invoking the cleanup task and clears it after the flushing is complete. This ensures that the cleanup is synchronized with the ULP's group joining and leaving operations.

The patch also includes proper locking mechanisms and memory management for the cleanup task.

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch introduces a semaphore, `hyperv_mmio_lock`, to lock access to the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. This is necessary because other patches in the series introduce runtime modifications to the resource tree that can occur on multiple threads. Therefore, introducing locking ensures thread safety and prevents potential race conditions.

2. The patch adds the `down(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` call before iterating over the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree, indicating that the lock is acquired before accessing the tree.

3. The `up(&hyperv_mmio_lock)` call is placed in the `exit` label, ensuring that the lock is released before returning from the function.

4. The patch also modifies the return value of the `vmbus_allocate_mmio` function. Instead of always returning `-ENXIO`, it now returns `retval`, which is set to `0` when a suitable resource is found. This change allows the caller to differentiate between failure (`-ENXIO`) and success (`0`).

Overall, the patch introduces necessary locking to ensure thread safety when accessing the `hyperv_mmio` resource tree. It also improves the return value handling, making it more informative. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch disables PM runtime for multi-platform ARM with genpd support on R-Car or RZ. This is because using the default PM Domain with PM_CLK prevents the registration of the real Clock Domain from DT later.

2. The patch simplifies the platform logic by replacing explicit SoC checks with a single check for the presence of MSTP clocks in DT. This is applicable to most multi-platform ARM shmobile platforms (SH-Mobile, R-Mobile, R-Car, RZ) that use DT-based PM Domains for PM runtime management of module clocks.

3. Backwards compatibility with old DTs (mainly for R-Car Gen2) is ensured by checking for the presence of a "#power-domain-cells" property in DT.

4. The default PM Domain is still needed for backward compatibility with old DTs lacking PM Domain properties, the CONFIG_PM=n case, legacy (non-DT) ARM/shmobile platforms without genpd support, and legacy SuperH.

Considering the above points, the patch appears to address specific issues related to PM runtime management and improves platform logic. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

The patch addresses an issue specific to the Intel Valleyview SoC, where SATA device sleep (DEVSLP) is unreliable. When DEVSLP is attempted on certain SSDs, it can result in the malfunction of the AHCI controller. This can lead to the AHCI controller not being shown in PCI enumeration after a reset, requiring complete power source removal for recovery.

To mitigate this issue, the patch blacklists the affected device and overrides the reported capabilities of the host device. It ensures that device LPM (Link Power Management) will only attempt slumber but not DEVSLP.

The patch also adds a new function, `ahci_broken_devslp()`, which checks if the device has broken DEVSLP but still shows SDS (Slumber Device Sleep) capability. This function is used to set the `AHCI_HFLAG_NO_DEVSLP` flag in the AHCI host private data structure, indicating that the controller cannot perform DEVSLP.

Additionally, the patch modifies the `ahci_save_initial_config()` function to handle the case where the controller cannot perform DEVSLP. It turns off the HOST_CAP2_SDS (Slumber Device Sleep) and HOST_CAP2_SADM (Aggressive Device Sleep Management) capabilities if the `AHCI_HFLAG_NO_DEVSLP` flag is set.

Overall, the patch effectively addresses the issue with DEVSLP on Intel Valleyview SoC and ensures that DEVSLP is disabled for the affected devices. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

3. The patch also checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_FULLCKSUM flag set and if skb->ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE. If these conditions are met and the packet's protocol is ETH_P_IP, it resets the transport header and sets it to the correct offset using skb_reset_transport_header() and skb_set_transport_header(). Then, it calls vnet_fullcsum() to compute the full checksum.

4. Finally, the patch checks if the packet has the VNET_PKT_HCK_IPV4_HDRCKSUM_OK flag set. If it does, it sets skb->ip_summed to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL and skb->csum_level to 0.

Overall, the patch addresses the necessary initialization and checksum computation for IPv4 packets in the vnet_rx_one() function. It appears to be a valid and necessary fix, so it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

true || To determine whether this Linux kernel patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK) or not (NAK), let's analyze the patch.

The patch addresses a race condition during inode initialization in the Btrfs filesystem. The issue arises because the BTRFS_I(inode)->location field is set after the inode hash table lock is released. This can lead to a situation where the search for an existing inode in the hash table may fail if there is a race with the inode initialization code.

The patch modifies the code to set the location field earlier and changes the find actor function to match inodes based only on the location objectid. For inode hashing, a unique and stable test is sufficient, and it doesn't need to reflect the inode numbers shown to userland.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a race condition and improves the reliability of inode initialization in the Btrfs filesystem.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to be a fix for an issue in the mtk_tx_map() function in the mediatek Ethernet driver. The patch corrects a copy & paste error by using the correct descriptor pointer.

1. The patch aims to optimize the irq restore process in the s390 architecture.
2. It replaces the ssm instruction with the stosm instruction, which is faster.
3. The patch introduces a new macro, ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED, to represent the enabled state of interrupts.
4. The arch_local_irq_restore function is modified to check if the flags indicate a transition from disabled to disabled or disabled to enabled. If so, it enables interrupts using arch_local_irq_enable.
5. The arch_irqs_disabled_flags function is updated to use the new ARCH_IRQ_ENABLED macro.
6. The patch also modifies the paging_init function in arch/s390/mm/init.c to use the __arch_local_irq_stosm function instead of arch_local_irq_restore.

Overall, the patch improves the performance of irq restore by using a faster instruction and introduces necessary changes to handle the enabled state of interrupts correctly. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a problem with the interrupt flags on the Rx LL2 in the qed driver. The issue arises when the spinlock is released and re-claimed during the processing of packets, potentially leading to incorrect interrupt status at the end of the processing.

2. The regression causes a deadlock scenario in the mars-nwe (NetWare emulator) where the ncpserv process reads a request using recvmsg, forks and spawns nwconn, and then calls a blocking recvmsg while waiting for new requests. This leads to a deadlock in nwconn when it tries to sendmsg on the same socket.
3. The commit b0d0d915 replaced the BKL locking with lock_sock/release_sock, but it did not handle the scenario where a blocking recvmsg would block a concurrent sendmsg.
4. The patch modifies the ipx_recvmsg function to only keep the socket locked while working with the socket data and releases it prior to calling skb_recv_datagram.
5. The patch includes proper Signed-off-by and Reviewed-by tags.

Overall, the patch addresses a regression and fixes a locking issue in the ipx module. It ensures that a blocking recvmsg does not block a concurrent sendmsg, preventing deadlocks. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases (ACK).

3. The patch has been reviewed and signed-off by two individuals, indicating that it has undergone some level of scrutiny and testing.

4. The patch is cherry-picked from a commit, which suggests that it has already been tested and proven to be effective.

Based on these factors, it seems reasonable to include this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the mentioned issue.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch modifies the code in multiple files within the `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon` directory. It adjusts the thermal protection requirements for certain GPU models (rv770 and newer) in the Radeon driver.

The change removes the dependency on clock gating for thermal protection and instead checks if the GPU has a thermal sensor (`rdev->pm.int_thermal_type != THERMAL_TYPE_NONE`). If a thermal sensor is present, the `pi->thermal_protection` flag is set to true; otherwise, it is set to false.

This change simplifies the thermal protection logic by removing the unnecessary dependency on clock gating. It ensures that thermal protection is enabled as long as a thermal sensor is present, regardless of clock gating.

Since this change improves the code by removing unnecessary conditions and simplifying the logic, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.

3. The patch proposes keeping sig_count per connection instead of as a static variable. This change ensures that each connection has its own sig_count, preventing potential race conditions and overflow issues.

4. The change in the iser_signal_comp function modifies the parameter type of sig_count from int to u8, which is more appropriate since sig_count is now per connection.

5. The iser_send_command function now increments the sig_count variable per connection, ensuring that the correct value is passed to the iser_post_send function.

Overall, the patch appears to fix a specific regression and addresses a potential issue with the send queue overflow. It introduces a necessary change to the sig_count variable and ensures that each connection has its own sig_count. Therefore, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided information, it appears that this patch is fixing an issue related to out-of-bounds memory accesses in the nouveau_fbcon_init() function of the drm/nouveau driver. The patch sets the buf_align value to 4, but only if fbcon->helper.fbdev is not NULL.

To determine whether this patch should be accepted in Linux -stable releases, we need to consider a few factors:

1. Bug report: The patch is addressing a specific bug reported in the kernel bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120591). This indicates that there is a known issue that needs to be fixed.

2. Fix justification: The patch is fixing an out-of-bounds memory access issue that causes kernel oops when loading the nouveau module with a GTX 780 Ti video adapter. This suggests that the patch is addressing a critical issue that affects a specific hardware configuration.

3. Patch quality: The patch itself is relatively simple and appears to address the issue correctly by checking if fbcon->helper.fbdev is not NULL before setting the buf_align value. The patch also includes proper sign-offs and references to the relevant commit and file.

Based on these factors, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). It addresses a specific bug, provides a reasonable fix, and has been tested and reviewed by relevant contributors.
true || Based on the provided patch, it appears to fix a bug related to the symbol rate calculation in the tda10071 driver for DVB frontends. The patch multiplies the symbol rate value by 1000, which seems to be a correction to the previously returned value being too small.

Considering the nature of the patch, it seems to be a bug fix rather than an enhancement or new feature. Therefore, it is likely suitable for inclusion in Linux -stable releases. 

I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK).
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

The patch addresses a specific issue related to early controllers incorrectly reporting zero ports in the PORTS_IMPL register. The ahci driver currently fabricates PORTS_IMPL based on the number of ports in these cases. However, with the new nvme controllers, there are cases where zero PORTS_IMPL is valid and should be honored.

The patch disables the workaround for AHCI versions greater than or equal to 1.3. This means that for AHCI versions 1.3 and above, the fabricating of port_map from cap.nr_ports will not be performed.

The patch has been signed-off by Tejun Heo and reported-by Andy Lutomirski. It also includes relevant links and Cc's to ensure proper attribution and communication.

Considering the specific issue being addressed and the fact that the patch has been reviewed and signed-off, it seems appropriate to include it in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific bug (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75401), indicating that it aims to fix a known issue.

2. The patch is signed-off by two developers, Alex Deucher and Christian König, which indicates that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

3. The patch modifies the "radeon_atrm_get_bios" function in the "radeon_bios.c" file, which is related to handling non-VGA class PCI devices with ATRM (ATRM stands for AMD Thermal Regulation Management).

4. The patch introduces a new check to handle cases where newer PX systems have non-VGA PCI class dGPUs. It updates the ATRM fetch method to handle these cases.

5. The patch adds a loop that iterates over non-VGA class PCI devices and checks if they have an ACPI handle named "ATRM". If such a handle is found, it sets the "found" flag to true, indicating that the ATRM fetch method should be used.

6. If no suitable non-VGA class PCI device with the "ATRM" ACPI handle is found, the patch returns false, indicating that the ATRM fetch method should not be used.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for the mentioned bug and introduces necessary changes to handle non-VGA class PCI devices with ATRM. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: The patch is aimed at resolving GPU hangs that occur on some machines when large amounts of text scroll in an xterm. This issue has been reported by Udo Steinberg.

2. The patch is targeted: The patch specifically targets the SNB (Sandy Bridge) architecture, disabling semaphores on this architecture. Semaphores are known to cause problems on SNB machines.

3. The patch maintains compatibility: The patch ensures that semaphores remain enabled for IVB (Ivy Bridge) architecture, indicating that the change is specific to SNB.

4. The patch is signed-off by relevant individuals: The patch has been signed-off by Keith Packard and Linus Torvalds, indicating that it has been reviewed and approved by them.

Considering these factors, it seems reasonable to accept this patch in Linux -stable releases to address the reported GPU hangs on SNB machines.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting it in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: It fixes a double-free bug that occurs when the next beacon is sent in the ath9k driver.

2. The bug is described clearly: When a new beacon is not successfully obtained from mac80211, the bf->bf_mpdu is not reset, but the skb (socket buffer) is freed. This leads to a double-free on the next beacon transmission attempt, resulting in a system crash.

3. The fix is straightforward: The patch adds a line of code to reset bf->bf_mpdu to NULL when the skb is freed. This ensures that the double-free bug does not occur.

4. The patch includes proper attribution: It includes the Signed-off-by tags from the authors, Felix Fietkau and John W. Linville, indicating their acknowledgment and approval of the patch.

5. The patch is marked for stable release consideration: The Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org line indicates that the patch is intended for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on these factors, it seems that the patch effectively addresses a specific bug and has been reviewed and approved by the relevant authors. Therefore, it should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
true || Based on the provided patch, I would recommend accepting this patch in Linux -stable releases (ACK). Here's the analysis:

1. The patch addresses a specific issue: data corruption observed during read/write stress tests in the ti-qspi driver.
2. The patch explains the root cause of the issue: writing an invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG terminates the current transfer and de-asserts the chip select. However, if spi_finalize_current_message() is called before de-asserting the chip select, the next transfer can overlap with the previous one, leading to data corruption.
3. The patch proposes a fix by moving the write of the invalid command to QSPI_SPI_CMD_REG before calling spi_finalize_current_message(). This ensures that the chip select is de-asserted before scheduling the next transfer, preventing data corruption.
4. The patch includes proper Cc and Signed-off-by tags, indicating that it has been reviewed and tested by the relevant parties.
5. The patch is also marked for stable@vger.kernel.org, indicating that it is suitable for inclusion in stable releases.

Based on this analysis, the patch appears to be a valid fix for a specific issue and should be accepted in Linux -stable releases.
